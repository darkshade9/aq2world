The entire A-Team thanks him for 			providing a great service for all of us for so long.  I am sure the thousands 			of board visitors would also thank him.  Although I am sorry to see it go, I 			understand that he has hosted it much longer than many people could or would 			have.  I hope that everyone else will understand the same thing and avoid 			flooding him with emails on the subject.  The result is that we are looking for 			another host for the UBB messageboard, so if you are willing then please email 			us at 			<a href="mailto:ateam@telefragged.com">ateam@telefragged.com</a> 			or email me directly. 			</p> 			<p> 			If you haven't checked out the Actor's Guild in a while, I recommend you do so. 			Lot's of cool stuff in the optionals section especially.  Hammer just finished 			getting a news updating script that will make it easier and faster for them to 			keep you up to date.  Check it out.  (there is a button 			to it at the bottom of the page). 			</p> 			<p> 			I received a lot of emails from Action Quakehttp://ahl.action-web.net</a> 			.  The first beta is out and an update will be coming shortly which will add 			the Staying Alive scoring for Deathmatch, Action style teamplay, a ton of bug 			fixes, a couple missing models/sounds, and the jump kick (maybe both jump 			kicks).  So go over there and check it out. 			</p> 			<p> 			The mod expo went very well and I will do a write up soon.  I am having a LOT 			of problems connecting faster than 14.4 and staying online any longer than a 			few minutes.  I think a recent storm must have nocked my phone lines out of 			wack, so right now I am having problems keeping up.  Please be patient. 			</p> 		</font> 		<FONT COLOR=#000000> 			<p> 			I hate my phone lines.

I 				expect that it would help quite a bit if the mod teams themselves keep in touch 				with the webmasters of this site for everyone's (especially fans of your mods) 				good.  Large thank you to the group working on this. 				</p> 				<p> 				I found an extremely cool program that allows you to rip, edit, change, and 				resave images and other resources form almost any windows32 program.   I used 				it a LONG time ago to make winamp 'skins' before there was such a thing as 				winamp skins.  I recently refound it and was pleased to find he has done 				wonders with the new beta, including the ability to make stand alone .exe files 				that recreate changes.  It is only able to do that in the registered version 				but I will hopefully have a registered version soon.  I mention this here 				because I think it serves as a very unique (and rather welcome) way to edit 				many programs and give them action themes.  For example, I have been using ICQ 				since it's first month of release and I have always HATED two things about it. 				1)that annoying fog horn, which I delete every time I redownload icq and 2) 				that STUPID flower, which is worse than ever in the splash screens of today's 				versions.  So I took restorator (this program I am rambling about) and my own 				personal crosshairs for AQ2 and converted the crosshairs to the splash screen. 				Now the splash screen is bigger, but is only really thin lines so doesn't get 				in the way at all, pus it repeats the words splash screens suck over and over. 				Is that spiffy or what?!  So to make a long story short, what I want to do is 				start a new section under optionals over at the Actor's Guild and start 				accepting, making, and distributing these .exe wizards to turn programs into
 				action themed programs.  Almost anything is possible.  Imagine netscape skins 				(like winamp sins for netscape), or changing the interface to a game (as long 				as the game is the right kind of .exe), shrinking, removing, or changing 				annoying splash screens, replacing an ugly program's graphics with action 				themed ones, or the buttons etc.  A fully decked out clan customized version of 				icq with the little pansy flower replaced by a sniper crosshair and the rest 				all themed in action wit your clan logo in place of the icq text on the button. 				The list is endless.  Anyways, I find the prospect extremely cool, so if you 				don't then just skip this link and ignore my ramblings. But if this interests 				you like it does me then click here... 				<a href="http://www.aq2world.com/archives/action.telefragged.com/www.telefragged.com/mirrors/mirror.pl?action/win32verdanafont.zip">here</a> 			) if you do 			not have it. 		</FONT> 		</P> 	</BODY> </HTML>
