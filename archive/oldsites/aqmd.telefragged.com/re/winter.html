<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Layout - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">From Pacman[TECH] comes this
adventure which takes place up in the snowy high country, with
beautiful snow capped mountain peaks rising high into the air.
This uniquely designed map centers around a small, partially iced
over river complete with waterfall. The map is divided into four
distinct sections, all which join at an icy intersection. Consider
this another fast moving map, as there are many open areas, which
are playable on multiple levels. You are able to climb the rocky
walls throughout the entire map. Some of the overlooking areas
do provide blocks of ice which act as cover when under fire. Carefully
timed jumping on the icy ledges and you can maneuver most of the
map. Back on the ground level, the walls rise skyward into dazzling
arches and majestic cliffs. There are many pine trees on the map,
some standing tall, others lying on the ground. The two features
unique to this map are 'The Pit' and the partially ice covered
river. If you make any attempt to climb the pit, you die. The
sheet of ice covering the river is very slick, with can work both
ways for you depending on your situation. As the ice breaks, it
flows over another cliff into a chilling river, with chunks of
ice floating in the water. There are also numerous caves to explore,
which further help you navigate the map in stealth. There is also
an outcropping above 'The Pit' which does provide ample cover
for those sniper types, which gives a wide open view of a large
portion of the playing field. Lines of fire are only interrupted
by the small hills and the constant change in elevation which
on the ground.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Textures &amp; Sky - Score
7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Two main textures dominate the
map, those being the brushed white snow which covers the ground
and surrounding ledges on the rocky walls. The rough and rocky
brown texture dominates the remaining areas, such as the walls
of the map. This texture also includes touches of white, simulating
snow. Those textures combined with the cold, flowing blue water
are a nice contrast. The trees are modeled in a green and brown
texture. The background and sky textures looks great and really
give you a sense of being up in the cold, and windy mountains.
The background especially, I get the sense of being in a foreign
land. As for the sky, most is cover by the white and grey of the
clouds as the clear clue attempts to peak through.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Prefabs - Score 5</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The use of prefabs are scattered
throughout the entire map. From the towering pine trees to the
ice blocks on the ledges. The trees are of simple design, which
help the r_speeds by keeping them low, but the trees look a bit
generic. The ice blocks which you see on the ledges just seem
out of place. This could be due to their square shape. They are
functional, but don't do the aesthetics any favors. Any sort of
shape change in those blocks to give them a bit of randomness
would have made them more pleasing to the eye. Similar to the
blocks which are above 'The Pit'.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sounds - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As you spawn on the map and
throughout the remainder of the round, you will have the cold
and constant howling of a blowing wind. This sound fits excellent
on Winter. As you approach the any of the three waterfalls you
will hear the splashing of water. Both sounds fit the theme of
the map and further help to strengthen the ambience. But what
I want to know is, where is the ferocious scream of the Tibetan
Yeti?</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lighting - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The map is set during the day,
which allows the use of shadows to be cast on any freestanding
object. This was well put to use, to create shadows being cast
off the trees, cliffs and the ice blocks. As you approach the
caverns, the interior lighting seems to give off an inviting warm
glow. The caverns are darker, but have ample lighting which provide
for no completely dark areas for players to hide. A very difficult
map to light due to the brightness of the snow, but the author
did a fine job with the use of his shadows.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Playability - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">All the files unzip into their
correct directories. As for the r_speeds, they are great throughout
the entire map. There is one small area over near the machine
gun which had r_speeds which crept up to 1000-1100, but the area
which it effects is minute. The remainder of the maps has speeds
which play great over the internet. Speeds ranged from 100-400
on most all of the ground while running tough the map. It does
have a few areas which play a bit higher, from 500-800, generally
these areas were scattered over the map, but they seemed to be
contained to a small areas.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Teamplay - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It was time to get it on in
the cold and winter wonderland, teams were set at 5 per side and
the action began almost immediately. As the round began bullets
were flying from all directions, play seemed to converge on the
area near the frozen river. Those would be snipers took for the
security of the cliffs to gain a better vantage point. Disposing
of them turned out to be easier then on some maps, since they
were left quite exposed to the elements and an opponents bullet
in the backside. In the beginning, the ice cause a few problems
and some easy kills, as some slid right into the own death. The
play was rather fast, and with 10 players, seems there was always
someone waiting around the next tree to let loose on you.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">DM - Score</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">N/A</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Originality - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The snowy setting, the blowing
wind all create an original setting in which to hunt down your
opponent. It is a great looking map, which offers a great time.
It does not offer much in the way of surprises, rather plays straight
forward. The use of the icy surfaces and the flowing waterfalls
are wonderful touches, along with 'The Pit' are the main features
of this map. I need to mention 'The Pit', it feels just that,
bottomless and empty. It makes the map feel as if there is a void.
You see the waterfall going down the side of the pit and it just
ends. If there is one thing I would like to see it would be more
caves, to offer more access to the map. Great job on the map aside
from that.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">General Feel - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This map is a wonderful change
from the daily grind of the city block maps. It is not an overly
large map, which make the action fast and furious and the frags
pile up. I sure hope we see this map pop up on some servers. It
should keep players coming back for more action, round after round.
Remember watch that ice, it can take one by surprise at the most
inopportune time.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Final Rating - Score 6.4
(58/9)</FONT></B></P>
