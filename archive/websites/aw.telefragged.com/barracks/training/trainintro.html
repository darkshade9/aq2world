Got fragged? Bad? Yeah well thats the it alaways is when you first start playing something. You connect start playing and your dead in moments, well don't dispare this training guide will help you so you can at least stand a chance against some of the more seasoned players.  Read carefully and look at the guides and i ensure you will be fragging in no time. The <a href="shootrnge.html" target="main">shooting range</a> is the place to go to learn about the weapons and the situations they are best suited in. Then once you are familiar with the weapons you will be suppliedwith all the items and which suit what best. Then head over to the <a href="hitthestreets.html" target="main">hit the streets</a> section to learn about the strategies and methods of the veterans. Once you have learned the basics of the game and some simple tactics check out the <a href="tipsntacts.html" target="main">tips and tactics</a> section to learn all the tricks off the trade for both teamplay and deathmatch.<br>
<p>There are many different stratagies in AQ2, due to the fact that it's based on realism. There are some basic rules and strategies for the game but it gets more complex as you become a more advanced player. I have compiled a very extensive amount of information regarding all these matters that i think will get you off to a good start.</p>
