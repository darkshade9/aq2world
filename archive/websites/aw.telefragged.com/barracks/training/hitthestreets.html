<br><br><font face="Arial,'Times New Roman'" size="2" color="Teal">Well done! you have come this far in your training and soon you will be a <b>big</b> soldier!<br>
In this area of the barracks you will be taught all the strategies that the AQ2'er needs to <u>stay alive</u>. Passed down through generations of players these are the key facts to <i>your</i> survival they are the strategies that every good AQ2'er knows and uses and you <i>must</i> use them too!<br></div><br>
Ok lets start with the basics, I mean the <i>very</i> vasics, which is combonation selection, or in other whats what weapons and items you are going to choose to do your killing with.<br>
Say you want an Handcannon, and then you choose a silencer?!?! Not very good at all, as a silencer aint going to screw onto a double barrel sawn off shotgun! So you should think first, handcannon can be used in several different strategies:<br>
<b>Stealth</b><br>
<b>Aggression</b><br>
<b>Defence</b><br>
Three strategies, three very different situations. Lets look at the stealth one. Using a handcannon to sneak around with is great fun but if you want to be sneaky it's no use having a laser sight, nooooo way what you need is a pair of <b>Stealth Slippers</b> because if a sniper is zoomed in looking around the map and you come up behind him your issue 67 army boots are going to give you away, but with the slippers the sniper won't know of your presence till your press the trigger and blow his sorry little ass away! But if you are going to go agro and charge at them then them not hearing you isn't going to help. No what you need is some protection, the <b>Kevlar Vest</b> is perfect and will stop any nasty little mp5 bullets cracking your ribs open. But when going defence you may want to think about ammo, so the <b>Bandolier</b> will come into play here.<br>
Now I won't be doin examples of all the weapons in that much detail but here are some good combos for the weapons:<br>
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="Silver"><ul type="disc"><li type="disc">Mp5/10 with Laser sight (improves accuracy) or with silencer (strap on the black belt your going ninja style [stealth that is])</li>
<li type="disc">M3 Assult shotgun with kevlar vest (blast them whilst they try to scratch you) or with bandolier (load up with ammo to become RAMBO)</li>
<li type="disc">M4 assult rifle with Kevlar (get protected) or stealth slippers (try sneaking around with this)</li>
<li type="disc">Sniper Rifle with Silencer (damn it's goin to be hard to find you) or bandolier(turn on irvision and you will see anyone very very clearly)</li>
<li type="disc">Hand Cannon with stealth slippers (blast those pesky snipers!) or bandolier (lots of ammo for you to boom ya way around)</li>
</ul></font><br>
A <i>very</i> important aspect of Death Match is to know where the guns, ammo and items are. If you can remember where the best weapons are you will be winning. Also it's good to know how to escape from your enemy. Work out little escape routes or just jump around like crazy strafing like mad until you get away, <u>remember</u> if you have a pistol and he has an M4 it's better you run and fight another day than die and let him have the frag. Also dont forget to reload, if you have 3 bullets in your clip then just chuck in a new one because in the middle of a gun fight 3 bullets will be your down fall, the same goes for the sniper rifle, reload it at <i>any</i> spare chance that you have so that it's always topped up and ready to go! Believe me there is nothing worse than lineing up the perfect head shot only to hear the "click click" of an empty chamber. Chuck away any weapons that dont have any ammo left so you can pick up a new one. <br>
A very important aspect of Team Play is to get into the habit of remebering the <b>spawn</b> points when the round starts. This is almost vital infact as this enables you to know where they will coming from, this will also help you get on top of them fast!<br>
Another survival technique that is very important is to not let those pesky snipers snype you when your out in the open, get into the habit of jumping, and strafeing all the time when out in the ope as this lowers the chance of being sniped alot. Remember <b>always</b> keep moving never stay still.<br>
<b>Conservation</b>, is another key factor that must be payed attention to. Ammunition is what im talking about, u only get 1 extra clip (unless you get a bandolier in which case you can have 2 extra clips) and if you use it all up in an attempt to hit one guy then you wont last long. With automatic guns dont do bursts of more than 12 bullets as your controll and aim will be long gone by then. Keep it around 5-6 bullets especially with the M4 as the barrel of the gun rises as you fire. With guns like the shotgun and sniper rifle conservation is still needed, dont just hold fire when using the shotty, as stupid as it may seem you still need to aim with it.<br>
Conversation is very very important if you want to win. You <b>must</b> let your team mates know whats going on. Tell them your health, gun ammo, ask who is left playing, tell them that you have spotted the enemy and tell them which direction you saw them, and to do all this you have to use the radio, all the radio settings are explained in the <a href="../thesetup/comms.html" target="main">the communication center</a>, it is vital to let your team know this information. Work as a team and you will win as a team.<br>
But of course none of this applies in death match :P no in deathmacth you frag anything that moves so you dont need to worry so much about talking to anyone.<p>
Well this is it for now, although i will be changing it so stay tuned!
