<p><font face="Arial,'Times New Roman'" size="2" color="Teal">Well congratulations, by now you should have a fully functional Action Quake2 on your hard drive, with your own customized config, all the maps you need loads of skins, and a local server to play on. But before you start your training there are just a few important things to remeber. This is just a brief summary of some of the things that you should take into consideration.<br>These are all listed below:<br>
<ul type="circle">
<li type="1">Always have a backup copy of your config, you never know when you might need it.</li>
<li type="1">Make sure that all the keys you have binded don't perform other tasks, for example if you have bound "b" to bandage but it is already bound to reload then the next time you get shot dont expect to bandage as this button is already in use.</li>
<li type="1">Go through your config and check that you haven't made any spelling mistakes for the comands, for example "bind b bandge" that won't work because bandage is spelt wrong. If something isn't working then it's probably because you have spellt it wrong.</li>
<li type="1">Your config has to feel comfy to you. If you  find you are having trouble getting to certain keys in time then shuffle it around. The most important keys should be as close to your directional keys (up and down) as possible.</li>
<li type="1">Make sure that when you edit your autoexec.cfg file that you save it as autoexec.cfg, not as a text format.</li>
<li type="1">You don't actually edit your config at all it's the autoexec.cfg that you edit. You shouldnt edit the file called config as this is generated by quake and should not be edited.</li>
<li type="1">When you find a server make sure that it's reletivly local. As latency can be a problem. The higher the ping the worce lag you are going to experience.</li>
<li type="1">Don't let the more experienced players put you off. They were all newbies too. Just think maybe someday you will nock the socks off them!</li>
<li type="1">If you find a sever that you like and have a good average ping on then make sure you have all the maps for it as you will probably play on that server most.</li>
<li type="1">Just hang in there you will get good it just takes time</li>
</ul></font>
