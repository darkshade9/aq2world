<font face="'Arial','Times New Roman'" size="3" color="white">The files:</font><br><br>
<font face="Arial,'Times New Roman'" size="2" color="Teal">Ok, to get into the action you need the mod (duh). There are 2 types of files that you can download, you can get the <a href="http://www.telefragged.com/mirrors/mirror.pl?action/actn1Ccl.exe">installer(8.8megs)</a> or the <a href="http://www.telefragged.com/mirrors/mirror.pl?action/actn1Ccl.zip">zip file(8.8)megs</a>. You will also need an updated version of Quake2, grab the latest version from <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/files/" target="main">here</a>.</font><p>
<font face="'Arial','Times New Roman'" size="3" color="white">The maps:</font><br><br>
<font face="Arial,'Times New Roman'" size="2" color="Teal">Ok you next have to download some maps. There are many maps out there, here are the main ones that you will need:<br>
Urban<br>
Urban2<br>
Urban3<br>
Police<br>
Teamjungle<br>
City<br>
Actcity2<br>
Actcity3<br>
Rhcity<br>
Highrise<br>
Basev28<br>
Cliff2<br>
Ruins2<br>
Ruins3<br>
These are just some "main" maps that are played on many AQ2 servers. I recommend heading over to the <a href="http://aqmd.telefragged.com/" target="_blank">Map depot</a>, when there download the map packs then download anymaps that take your fancy, make sure you have the Urban series as these are played on most servers. If you feel like downloading a big file (57megs to be exact) then head over to <a href="http://www.ast.com.au/abcgi/actionquake" target="main">ABCgi site</a> where he has released "The Big map pack" which contains every map in it! Simple and hassle free, i suggest this to any newbie.</font><p>
<font face="'Arial','Times New Roman'" size="3" color="white">Skins/models:</font><br><br>
<font face="Arial,'Times New Roman'" size="2" color="Teal">Ok one of the last things that you will need to download is skins and models. Head on over to the <a href="http://guild.telefragged.com/" target="main">The actors guild</a> and download guild pack one and guild pack 2 and you will have every skin and model there is.</font><p>
<font face="'Arial','Times New Roman'" size="3" color="white">Servers:</font><br><br>
<font face="Arial,'Times New Roman'" size="2" color="Teal">The final thing for you to do now is find a server. You can use <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/" target="main">gamespy</a>, grab a tab from <a href="http://action.telefragged.com/">here</a> or you can get the <a href="http://www.magna.com.au/~guvi/Q2_Pluggin.zip">qplug</a> and find a page with a server list. Many of the pages in the <a href="links.html">AQ2 links</a> section have them have a look and find some.</font>
