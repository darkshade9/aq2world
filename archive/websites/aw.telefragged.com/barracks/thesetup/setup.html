<p><font face="Arial,'Times New Roman'" size="2" color="Teal">Ok, you have downloaded Action Quake2 and have the full version of Quake2 v3.20 (go <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/files/" target="main">here</a> to grab the latest version) on your computer , now you are staring blankly at the screen. If you downloaded the installer then just simply run it, then type in the location of your quake2\action directory eg. if you installed Quake2 onto your hard drive, lets say C:\ then it would be located at C:\quake2 so your action directory should be C:\quake2\action simple, and if you downloaded the zipfile then simply extract the contents of the file into your quake2\action directory (all subdirectories will be automatically created) and then your done installing it! <b>But</b> you have only taken the first step to getting your AQ2 up and running hassel free. There is more to come yet, these are explained throughout the set up section.<br><br><br><div align="center"><a href="../index.shtml" target="_parent">Back to the barracks</a></font></div></p>
