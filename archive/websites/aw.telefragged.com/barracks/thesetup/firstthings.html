<font face="Arial,'Times New Roman'" size="2" color="Teal"><p>So you bought Quake2, you played it single player till you couldn't play it no more, then you discovered mutiplayer, you suffered torturous latency, campers, bad sports, abusers and so on...... until you got sick of running around shooting people in the head more than once without getting your frag to find someone behind you with the BFG. POP, your gibs are all over the place and u slam the keyboard in frustration screaming DAMMIT IS THERE ANY GOD!!!!! Well your prayers have been answered.</p></font><br><br>
<p><font face="Arial,'Times New Roman'" size="2" color="Teal">Action Quake 2 is based on realism, using <b>real</b> weapons with <b>real</b> hit point values. There are two types of play Deathmatch(DM) and Teamplay(TP), death match is like any ordinary quake2 death match but with all the AQ2 fetures, you run around find weapons, ammo and items shoot, bandage, duck and cover etc. Where in TP you are part of a team, you choose your team (teams are seperate by having a saperate skin each) then your weapon and then your item. You can't pick up extra weapons and items plus there isn't any ammo lying around, which adds loads of strategy to the gameplay. TP is played in <b>rounds</b> where each team has to elimenate the other the first who does so wins the round. There is usually a round limit set aswel as a frag limit and a time limit before you go onto the next round. The team to reach the round limit first wins the map! Yet another great feature about this mod is the it point values, meaning if you shoot someone in the head then they are dead, who's heard of surviving a bullet to the head? If you were to get shot in the leg you aint going to be running away to quick with a bullet through your thigh, also if you get shot in the leg, or chest or anywhere you won't just grunt and your health go down a set number of points no you will loose health <i>and</i> continue to loose health until you bandage. You are only human so you can only carry one special weapon (weapons listed in weapons section) and a pistol, knive and an item (items listed in items section) plus you can only carry certain number of clips per weapon. Not being able to carry more than one weapon! Only a little bit off ammo! One item only! You keep dying! Sounds bloody awfull! Well it <b>isn't</b> all these little features add an incredible amount of strategy to the game. <br>Once you start playing you <b>will</b> understand. You <b>will</b> see the light!</font></p>
