I have completed the <a href="training/hitthestreets.html" target="main">Hit the streets</a> section, it aint fully finished but it's up. I have tried to gather tips and tactics from the more experienced AQ2 players by posting numerous messages on the official AQ2 msg board and my local AQ2 one but all i got was joking and stupidity, like "bind k kill" stupid pointless stuff like that and im not happy about it. So unless some serious people have some tips and tactics they wish to share with me then please <a href="mailto:foig@telefragged.com">email me</a> but until then there will be no tips and tactics section due to the fact that the good players are just a bunch of clowns. It's a shame but what can you do eh? The reason about the lack of updates is that i have been <b><i>very</i></b> busy maintaining 3-4 pages and also co-running a AQ2 clan, plus there is school and various other activities but i asure you this page aint goin no-where!</font></table>

<p><font face="Arial,'Times New Roman'" size="2" color="Silver">Ok here's the bigger update :) I have played AHL and I have mixed feelings about it. I think maybe they should have waited for Quake3 and then done AQ3 as that would have provided better multiplayer all round. <b>But!</b> please people remeber it's a beta (more an alpha according to <a href="mailto: mr_grim@telefragged.com ">Mr_grim</a> so please dont cast a too harshful judgement just realize that it is in it's <i><u>very</u></i> early stages. Just think that AQ2 is no where near gone. Infact I think that AQ2 is still a far better game but only beacause AHL is no-where near final release. When it is finally finished then i will decide. Also i have decide to work on the AHL sections of the page but im not posting them until the final version is out because whats the point of doing all the tips and blah blah blah when the guns arn't even balanced yet? Well email, or ICQ me on what you think. All sections i hope will be complete by the end of the week leaving me time to work on teh AHL sections.<br>
Anyway in AQ2 and AHL new the official <a href="http://ahl.telefragged.com" target="_blank">AHL</a> site has been updated with some mirrors and a little news. Also at <a href="http://aow.killers.net" target="_blank">Action out West</a> (a top Australian site) there is a very interesting messageboard thread about aq2 and what they (some very good aussie players) would like to see done with the mod, check it out <a href="http://206.86.100.18:8080/factionoutwestmessages.showMessage?topicID=215.topic" target="_blank">here!</a>. Also i will be posting a M4 guide pretty soon so stay tuned for that :) Ok  till next time!</p> </font>

Also the <a href="training/talkthetalk.html" target="main">talk the talk</a> section is complete, so go check that out. I was wrong about AHL not being released on time it was but to get it you have to go to <a href="http://www.planethalflife.com" target="_blank">Planet Half Life</a> and grab it there. CGFbot central (a very good CGF site) has changed web hosts it's site is now at <a href="http://cgfbotcentral.quakecity.net/" target="_blank">http://cgfbotcentral.quakecity.net/</a> so update your bookmarks and get CGF as it rocks big bells.</p> </font>

I'm sure though that it will be awsome nontheless. I will probably use this page for the AHL section but im not sure yet.
