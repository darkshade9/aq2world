I would say this sub-machinegun is the most effective weapon in Action Quake DM. The ammo is usually quite abundant in most of the maps and you can carry 2 extra clips so there is plenty to dish out. I never use its burst-fire mode as I find it easier to regulate the flow of bullets myself instead of letting the weapon do it. Whenever possible, crouch while firing to greatly increase accuracy. It's effective range is about 100 feet so on maps like Urban 3 where the distance from one building to another is further than this; it is best to ignore any targets at that range. You'll probably miss, and half of the players in the level will now be alerted to your location. The mp5 being a desirable weapon, your cavalier shooting will land you with a slew of new enemies who will be glad to cap your ass for that nice mp5. When the weapon drops below about 7 rounds, I usually reload as its better to have a full weapon than an almost empty one and an extra clip. An extra clip is pretty useless when you wind up having to reload mid-way through a firefight. Be careful not to waste ammo with the MP5, 3-5 hits is usually plenty against any opponent so once I see the blood squirts, I'll usually just move on to the next victim before the last one hits the floor. If you don't hear them die, that's when you quickly turn back and execute them.</p> <p>Please visit COZMO's site <a href="http://www.quakeclan.net/una" target="main">here</a></p></font>
