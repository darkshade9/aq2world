<p><font face="Arial,'Times New Roman'" size="2" color="Teal">Ok, so you’ve picked the HC be it by accident or on purpose. Either way you are going to have to figure out how to use. Luckily you’ve already been here and you know you have the skills to start slinging people half way across urban. If not then you’ve probably been that flying corpse and after cussing and asking the guy how the hell he did that….he tells you to go to the action barracks. 
Ok you’ve arrived and headed straight here, so here the lesson shall begin.
When I HC, I prefer to use the slippers or vest dependant on the map and the amount of peo\ng to be an awful lot of stray shrapnel flying around. If there is just 3 or 4 then the slippers come into their element.<p>
I tend to try and get to a position where I can see a common walkway but that leaves an emergency exit should you get spotted. As soon as I see a potential kill wonder past I run back away from my hole and wait- Listen for footsteps of a following party. None? Good. Bolt like all hell outta the hole glancing into the walkway as you pass. Continue to strafe-jump towards the chump and just before you reach him BOOM! Blow that body right into its body bag.<p>
Problems arise when the enemy hears you and turns…now you are looking at a faceoff. Unfortunately the bullets from his gun most probably travel a lot faster and further than yours do, they also come out in a stream if it isn’t the sniper or pistols. When this happens you can either try to rush them or run away. When you are rushing a man try to jump towards them in an erratic manner so as to not become predictable. If you are going to run away try to run around a corner or behind some form of obstacle so this blocks his bullets. If he is a really bad shot he may even have empty his clips and come at you with his pistol. Take him OUT!<p>
Sometimes I just run straight towards a man (try to get on his side) and shoot him right there but this is normally the quickest and easiest way to die. But if you can pull it off you can just move onto the next bloke. As before remember to move erratically.
The main problem of the HC is that one you shoot it, EVERYONE around knows what gun you have and will now stand their ground when you charge them. A way around this is to grab the weapons lying around the map. Of course this is dependant on the server and if they allow you to use more than one weapon. But it is always a good idea to grab the last guys you blasted’s weapon. Just switch to it and scare the hell outta the static enemy.<P>
