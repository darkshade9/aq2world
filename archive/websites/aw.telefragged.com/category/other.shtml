<p>GRRRRRRr. I just spent AN HOUR typing up a GREAT update with tons of mods, and guess what just happened....I hit a keyboard shortcut to back, and now it's gone.

<p>Well, Beta 7 came out today for counter-strike and it looks good so far. The akimbo beretta's are a very welcome addition to the game, and from what I hear from friends, they kick major ass.However, the drivable vehicle addition is by far the largest addition to the mod. While it's not in full usage yet and only really on one map, I see a bright future for this aspect of the game.<br><br><br>Oh, and it has a new menu system. <br><br>In other news, I am going to start doing the clan spotlight again, and things kinda went off-track there for a while but it should be coming back to normal pretty soon here, kramed pulled a dissapearing act on me and went camping in the woods or something, but hes back now, and Ill get that phantom clan spotlight that never was up here some time.<br><br><a href="http://www.counter-strike.net/screenshots/test2.html" target="_blank" >Akimbo Beretta's and new menu system.</a> <br><br> <a href="http://www.counter-strike.net/screenshots/drive1.html" target="_blank" >Drivable Vehicle</a> <br><br><a href="http://www.counter-strike.net/screenshots/drive2.html" target="_blank" >Another Drivable Vehicle Shot</a> <br><br> <a href="http://www.counter-strike.net/screenshots/drive3.html" target="_blank" >Yet Another Drivable Vehicle Shot</a> <br><br> <a href="http://www.counter-strike.net/screenshots/drive4.html" target="_blank" >Yet Another Drivable Vehicle Shot</a> <br><br><p><p><font size=1>[Category: Mods]

<tr><td><b>Lack Of Updates</b> | @ 16:50 | <a href=mailto:nightmare@20id.org>Nightmare</a>
<p>Well, as you can see, I haven't updated in a while. I was SUPPOSED to have that clan spotlight up and another goodie which was a GK2K (greasy keyboards 2000) interview with homosaurus, but seeing as GK2K is now gone, it wouldn't do much good now would it? Maybe I'll do another one with him having highlights of GK2K or something. If you don't know what GK is, its where a bunch of AQ2'rs get together in the canadian woods, eat tons of bacon, play paintball, and I've heard rumors of pr0n viewing (seen a picture too, you can't deny it!) :) Well, back to my point, the reason is that kramed is the one to upload the interviews, and kramed has not been around in god know's how long....I have no clue as to where he is but I hope he gets back soon. If he's just too lazy to get on ICQ then SHAME ON YOU KRAMED.<p><p><font size=1>[Category: ActionWorld]

<tr><td><b>Urban Terror and others</b> | @ 20:17 | <a href=mailto:nightmare@20id.org>Nightmare</a>
<p>Urban Terror for Quake 3 came out today, and from what I've heard its bad; savable, but bad for the moment. Go check it out for yourself <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/siliconice/">here.</a> Firearms Release Candidate 2.2 for Half-Life has been out for a little while, but I feel that I should link to it anyway, because I think this mod is pretty badass. Go grab it  <a href="http://www.firearmsmod.com/">here.</a> In some AQ2 news, I am currently working on a replacement model for the knife, which will be a spoon. It's not skinned, and it's not fully animated yet, but I'm dedicated to making this work. Check it out  <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/pe/Scoob/spoon.jpg">here.</a> (you have to copy the URL and paste it into the "URL box" because we all know how cool angelfire is) I'm trying to figure out a way for you people to send me files so we can put em up on the site, and until I can, send them through ICQ to me at 16944414. That was going to be my other topic anyway, you people need to start sending in stuff so we can have a good library of skins and replacement models! Bastages! That's all for now, but remember, tomorrow brings another Sunday, which means a new clan will be in the spotlight.<p><p><font size=1>[Category: Other]

<tr><td><b>It's All Over </b> | @ 19:08 | <a href=mailto:nightmare@20id.org>Nightmare</a>
<p>Well, I'm sure you have all heard about the whole 20ID "force field" scandal,if you want to call it a scandal anyway, and if you're one of those people last to know everything, but read this page, here's an update.<br><br>The <a href=http://www.ogl.org>OGL</a>, after conversations via e-mail to people such as John Carmack, has decided not to take any action against 20ID and things will be resuming as normal now. However, we did have a brief scare with kramed, who took down Hooter Hut and Match-O-Rama. While I agree with the reasoning behind taking them down, I was very sorry to see them go for others. But, as I am told by Gleaker, they are back up...so all daboyz servers we all know and love are in full swing. Nothing really happening around the action scene lately other than that, but then again I just returned today from a trip to San Antonio, Texas..for 4 or 5 days...ugh.<br><br>In other news, a new counter-strike server side patch has been out for quite a while now(July 26,) so go check it out  <a href="http://www.counter-strike.net/" target="_blank" >here.</a> I'm looking forward to the beta7 release.<br><br>On a slightly MOD-ified action note, Urban Terror, which is simply defined as AQ2 for Q3(although there are differences,) is looking promising, and the first beta comes out this Saturday(august 5th.)Go check this one  <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/siliconice/" target="_blank" >for sure.</a> <br><br>Quakcon is going on right now in Dallas...and I am only 2 hours away from it, but can't go. Truly a shame, but you can head over to  <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/" target="_blank" >Planet Quake</a> and check out the coverage for yourself.<p><p><font size=1>[Category: Other]

<p>Well some of you might have seen me around, on message boards, or in-game, I go by ]20iD[Nightmare, and I'm gonna be bringing you guys all sorts of action news. I just came up with a new idea for action world, It's going to be "Clan Spotlight," where we will put a clan on spotlight each week, tell what they're all about, link to their page, and try to have an interview with the leader, so if any of you clanless people are looking for a good clan, you can come look at Clan Spotlight and see which clan is right for you! If you want your clan to be on Clan Spotlight then ICQ me at 16944414, or click my name to e-mail me at nightmare@20id.org :)<p><p><font size=1>[Category: ActionWorld]
