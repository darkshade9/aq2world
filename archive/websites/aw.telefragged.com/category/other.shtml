<p>Ok the reason I haven't updated in a long time is because I had to reinstall windows..which made me lose all my bookmarks, including the info for this site..so I had the idea to install the icq message archive and rummage through it and found my conversations with kram and found the link and login again yay. I have a lot of news but I need to get my 30 min. of sleep to wakeup and go to school, yay. <br><p><p><font size=1>[Category: ActionWorld]
