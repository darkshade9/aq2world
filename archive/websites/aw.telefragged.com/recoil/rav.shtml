<p><b>
Nightmare: So tell me a little about your clan, what are the rules? <BR>
zerov: rules...  no racist talking, not being a total prick, sense of humor, good attitude win or lose...  <BR>
Nightmare: Seems fair enough. <BR>
zerov: ok...  then just a good attitude without being .....  offensive all the time.<BR>
Nightmare: So not a lot of strict rules, just be cool, and play, and have fun right? <BR>
zerov: yep...  we haven't had to kick anybody out 'cause we are careful in who we choose.<BR>
Severe: pretty much.....we value fun above most other things.... <BR>
Severe: the Clan scene can be pretty frustrating with the prolific number of ""supposed" bot <BR>uses and a good many clans being strictly LPB clans now.
Nightmare: How many people are in your clan? I see 12 on your roster page, but sometimes clan pages arent updated :) <BR>
Severe: Ours is pretty current... <BR>
Nightmare: So 12 would be a safe estimate?<BR>
zerov: heh...  i haven't checked in a few days... we just had one guy leave to go to RUF... but otherwise, it's kept current.<BR>
zerov: yep... never more than 15.<BR>
zerov: so everybody can play in matches if they show up.<BR>
Nightmare: So its a close bunch that way right? <BR>
zerov: yep....  and no regard to ping...  one of the first recruits was Yama... he normally pinged 400 but was a good guy<BR>
zerov: now he's on cable and a total addict<BR>
zerov: heh<BR>
zerov: hehe. <BR>
Severe: very<BR>
Severe: I think so.   We definitly know everyone when we get on the servers...no surprises.<BR>
Nightmare: The action world is seeing more and more LPB only clans these days, good to know some all ping clans are still around.<BR> 
zerov: Severe is the webmaster...  he updates usually 2 times a week<BR>
Nightmare: I am HPB too. :) <BR>
zerov: yep... the guy who just left was still modem... and i can think of 2 or 3 others who are...  ping is a state of mind.<BR>
zerov: heh.<BR>
zerov: some (nameless) top clans seem to only recruit cable users, etc....  and it's kinda frustrating.<BR>
zerov: like the game itself doesn't mean as much....  of course, we won our last 2 OGL matches, so that's easy to say now... hehe.<BR>
Severe: we aren't all LPB.  We have a couple HPB's that continually spank LPB's .<BR>
Severe: modem mages.... <BR>
Nightmare: Does your clan have any motto or frequent saying? <BR>
zerov: motto...  not sure... I joined about a year and a half ago... maybe a little less...   when there were only 5 people and i knew<BR> all of them personally.
Severe: no, not really...but most of the members do....we have the Pound Patrol which use the "we'll hump your leg" thing... <BR>
zerov: but back then it was mostly just so we knew each others on servers...   frequent saying... most aren't printable... hehe.<BR>
Nightmare: Such as scoobi and scrappi? <BR>
Nightmare: the pound patrol. <BR>
Severe: yep..that's them! <BR>
zerov: oh god....  yeah.. that's a good one.. <BR>
zerov: heheh<BR>
Severe: we can always count on them to keep the conversation lively! <BR>
zerov: drewskee really kicks butt with his (sometimes) high ping<BR>
Nightmare: I see that on the 20ID MB its in scoob's signature hehe <BR>
Nightmare: "bark bark bark :D :D :D"  "we'll hump your leg" <BR>
Nightmare: :) <BR>
Severe: lol..yeah.  Please don't hold it against us for what they say! heh.<BR>
zerov: yep...  he's a trip for sure....  scoobs, scrapps, and redlead all know each other in RL.<BR>
Nightmare: Sounds cool. <BR>
zerov: and they met another guy from our clan, DR, recently.<BR>
zerov: yeah, we go for the cool people who are a bit weird but funny for the most part.<BR>
zerov: our IRC pre-match chats should probably involve strategy or something....  usually i'm crying from laughing.<BR>
Nightmare: So what servers do you guys play on the most, where people could most likely find you playing? <BR>
Severe: typically we would be on Jazzy's, the WC server.  But it's down for an upgrade, so we've been hitting Guts(199.75.226.10:27910) and Hammers(24.112.88.93:27910) lately. <BR>
zerov: we used to play on Jazzman's a lot.. in Florida... but it was recently pulled...  it's run by (WC)   ..  Severe is helping them to build another machine so they can get back up<BR>
zerov: otherwise... Guts, Hammer's<BR>
Nightmare: So you guys play Counter Strike as well, correct? <BR>
Severe: used to ALOT.  But I'm not too fond of the new net code.  It feels sloopy to me. <BR>
zerov: yep..  i haven't played as much with the new beta...  wish they didn't change it so much from beta to beta.<BR>
zerov: i understand the improvement concept, but changing the weapon system every beta is somewhat disturbing.<BR>
Nightmare: Alright then, is there anything you'd like to add for the reader's at home before we go? <BR>
Severe: If anything, just for eveyone to remember, "It's JUST a Game"....especially when in OGL matches, tensions can run pretty high. <BR>
Severe: Just enjoy it <BR>
Nightmare: Good advice <BR>
Nightmare: zerov anything else? <BR>
zerov: hmmmm....  i am looking forward to the new action-type games of UT and Q3, but since the first time I played action quake i have yet to find a game as addictive as it can be<BR>
zerov: prolly not<BR>
zerov: i talk too much anyway<BR>
zerov: hehehe<BR>
zerov: happens when you get old... :) <BR>
Nightmare: Im looking forward to those also. <BR>
zerov: ok man... i'll take a look at the article... :)   thx for interviewing us and good luck getting the page back up and running smooth<BR>
Nightmare: Alright, well thanks for your time.<BR>
