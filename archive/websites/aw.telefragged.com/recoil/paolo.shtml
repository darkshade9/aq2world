<CENTER><FONT SIZE="5" >Introduction</FONT></CENTER><BR>
If you've played Action Quake then you are no doubt familiar with the ActionMale PPM. 
After all, it's been included in the AQ client download since version 1.0c.<BR> 
Unfortunately, not enough credit is given to the modelers and skinners in the AQ2 files, 
so what you may not be aware of is that ActionMale is a modified version of the SuperMale PPM by Paolo "SuperMale" Piselli.<BR> 
I've been a big fan of the SuperMale PPM for a long time, and I was one of the fans who rallied for it to be 
supported by Action Quake. I was thrilled to discover that the modeler was attending UMass - Amherst, the same college 
as myself. I recently had the opportunity to interview Paolo by e-mail and it went great. Read on to see what make 
SuperMale tick:<P><BR><BR>


<!--ITEM-->
<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> Ok Paolo, why don't you start by telling us a bit about yourself? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> I have just graduated from UMass, Amherst with a degree in computer science. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> Other then SuperMale, what modeling experience do you have? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> I have taken a few classes in 3d modeling and animation through the computer science department at UMass, although none of my class work was as detailed as SuperMale.  For my classes I have used Specular Infini-D and Hash Animation Master, however SuperMale was done in 3DS MAX. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> How about skinning experience? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> I never did any skinning before SuperMale.  In fact, I didn't really play any quake2 until after I made the model. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> What programs and hardware do you use? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> For modeling, it's all about 3DS MAX.  For skinning (and 2D stuff in general) it's all about PhotoShop. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> In your opinion, what's the hardest part of modeling? What's the easiest? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> The hardest part of modeling would have to be the animating.  Firstly because it is the most time consuming, and secondly because it takes a lot of fine-tuning to make it look just right.  The easiest for me is modeling the geometry - that's just putting down a bunch of points. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> What lead to the creation of SuperMale? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> I wanted to learn 3DS MAX, and I had seen plug-in models for quake2.  I thought that making a PPM for q2 would be a fun way to learn MAX.  The idea for the model came from the lack of a generic model that could be easily skinned (in the way that the quake1 guy could), as well as the low-end system that I played on at the time.  Basically I wanted to create a model that was both easy to skin and of significantly fewer polygons than other models. </FONT><BR><BR>


<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> Other then the programs you mentioned, do you think there are any other tools or resources which aspiring modelers and/or skinners should check out? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> For modeling I would have to say that "Quake Modeler" and "Quake Model
Editor" are the two choices for those who can't get their hands on anything else - I use them for converting models between formats.  NPherno's Skin Tool is great for both setting up a skin mapping, and for a skin work in progress. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> So, how long did SuperMale take? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> Because I was working full time at the time, as well as teaching myself
MAX, SuperMale took the better part of the summer of 98 (two months). </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> What about the skins? How did you manage to get so many? Any favorites? </B></FONT><BR><BR>


<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> I figured that people would probably be more likely to enjoy SuperMale if their favorite Super-hero came ready to wear.  Plus I was having a lot of fun so ... I just cranked out skins (about 30 of my own).  I also tried to drum up some interest on the internet for making supermale skins.  Basically I emailed anyone who had made superhero skins, and posted messages at places like the Quake 2 Players Model Pack.  The response was good, considering that all I offered prospective skinners was credit for their work in the readme.  DaLinK was especially helpful, but has gone missing from the Q2 community for quite some time now. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> How did ActionMale come about? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> Well, one day I logged in to find an email from Suislide in my mailbox. He said he was interested in modifying my SuperMale mesh for use in AQ. I gave him the Ok, and the rest is history.  As a result of this, I have actually unofficially made SuperMale available for use in any mods, so long as myself and any skinners whose work is included are given credit. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> What were you expecting with ActionMale? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> Initially I was under the impression that the guys at AQ were going to completely reanimate the mesh.  From what I have seen however, I think ActionMale is just SuperMale scaled down to fit the requirements of AQ's hit location system. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> Do you have any future projects for us to look forward to? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> Although I am supposedly doing models for a few mods, including telefragged's own Star Wars: Call to the Force, I have been wicked (for those of you non-massachusetts types, that means "VERY") busy finishing up school.  I actually intend to dedicate this summer entirely to modelling, with the ultimate goal of developing a portfolio worthy of getting a professional modelling job (might be tough without the BFA). </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> Any chance of a SuperFemale? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> Still no word on that.  I have been thinking about reworking the model that I <A HREF="http://pile.evilavatar.com/32newy.htm">entered</A> into the low-poly lovedoll contest into SuperFemale, however my mod work will take priority over that. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> Name some of you favorite PPMs and tell us why you like them. </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> God, where to start?  There are so many excellent PPMs out there for Q2 alone ... perilith knight, blade, ryla, spaceman spiff, all those transformers, just to name a few.  The only problem is that there are so many good models out there that I just don't have the hard drive space for them all. </FONT><BR><BR>


<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> To you, what constitutes a "good" PPM? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> A PPM is great if it has great skins, great modeling, and great animation.  A deficiency in any one of these things detracts from a model. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> What do you think of Action Quake? Do you play much? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> AQ is probably the best mod out there (not counting CTF).  I play a little at LAN parties, but don't usually fit it into my regular schedule. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> What's your play style like? Favorite weapons? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> BOOM wit da shotty!  If I can't find a hand cannon, its snipe-city for me. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> Are there any other Quake 2 mods that you play? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> Nowadays I play more CTF than anything else. I still play a little DM. 
Oh yeah, and some late-night Gloom always rocks. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> What kind of play style do you have for those? Favorite weapons? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> CTF: I prefer base defense with plenty o' slugs on hand<BR>
DM: well the Yoda's barn stats say 50% of my kills are with rail ...<BR>
Gloom: face-huggin all the way </FONT><BR><BR>


<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> Are you in any clans? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> I have been in the Black Dragon Clan (OGL Open DM: b|d) since it was spawned out of the old incarnation of Big Trout (another UMass clan). </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> Do you have a web page or anything you'd like to plug? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> I'm looking for an entry level job in the videogame industry!  I am willing to relocate!  I have a degree in Computer Science!  I have programming experience!  I have modeling experience!  I can make coffee!  Just send this string of keywords to your HR department for parsing: C/C++, OpenGL, assembly, 3DS MAX, Photoshop.  Or better yet, check out samples of my work online at <A HREF="http://www-edlab.cs.umass.edu/~ppiselli/resume/">http://www-edlab.cs.umass.edu/~ppiselli/resume/</A> </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"><B> Anything else you want to say? </B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="2"> Well, if i'm using the handle "SuperMale" then:<br>
SUPERMALE WILL RAIN HEINOUS DEATH DOWN UPON YOU ALL!
<p>
but if i'm using the handle "b|d THX-1138" then:<br>
mmm hmm. </FONT><BR><BR>

<B>Thanks for taking the time to do this interview Paolo.<BR>
Well, that concludes the first edition of Recoil. I want your feedback, so send it to me!</B>
