-3 Teams in one level. (works just like normal Teamplay, only 2 teams need players to start gaming)<BR>
-New item: Helmet (Protects head somewhat well, not from knives. ;)<BR>
-M4 cant get Lasersight, but it is a bit more accurate than before without it.<BR>
-Lasersight doesn't help so much when running as it did before.<BR>
-Game will begin if just two of the 3 teams have players.<BR>
-Helmet works in DM too without modifying maps. (aq2 feature :)<BR>
-If there were 3 teams, but one gets empty, its score will be reseted back to 0.<BR>
-Messages when shooting to helmet. :)  <FONT SIZE=1>(e.g. Sinister has a helmet)</FONT><BR>
-Random Round Win Messages. :-)<BR>
-Variable for maxplayers per team is replaced with (<FONT COLOR=FF0000>set smallteam "0/1"</FONT>). It forces people to go to the team that has the least number of players.<FONT SIZE=2>(<FONT COLOR=FF0000>NOTE! </FONT>If smallteam is 1 you can only join a team through the teamjoin menu, the team command will always put you to team "none" and so, it will kill you if you are alive :))</FONT><BR>

-Shotgun & Handcannon check where you hit.<BR>
-Something else I find interesting/fun. :-) (maybe defineable weapon banning?)<BR>
