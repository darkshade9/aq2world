to hack around with the Quake1 engine and create some real life
firearms (which at the time really appealed to me.. Still do, I might
add). After making 4 or 5 weapon mods , I decided to compile them and
thus Navy SEALS for Quake1 was born. NS1, was a single player Partial
Conversion which included new enemies and several new guns. It wasn`t
that popular but I found it to be much more fun than Quake1
singleplayer (mind you, at the time, I found sticking my thumb in a
toaster more enjoyable than Quake1 SP). After Quake2 was released, I
was going to do a TC for Quake2 called Rolling Thunder, which totally
fell apart (because of school).. I didn`t want to have my models go to
waste so I asked the A-Team if I could join them. </font></td></tr>

some kind of controversy.. Have you talked to any of the members (and
x-members) of the A-Team?? Cause if you did, I`m pretty sure they`d
tell you the same thing.. I left because I didn`t want to do another
action-y style mod and wanted to return to what I really enjoyed
doing, which was trying to create the real life experience of a elite
special forces unit. Counterstrike was exactly what I wanted to do..
I`m really happy with how it turned out. It`s a shame there are so
many freaks and lamers out there who don`t like to play the game
properly (teamkillers, whiners, campers, arrogant rambo type dudes,
etc...)</font></td></tr>

	 <tr><td><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#a0a108">Answer:</font> I`m responsible for making all the models, animations, skinning, and
coding. Cliffe did some sound f/x and is the PR guy who really makes
my life a lot easier, and Viper-X did the HUD sprites (those weapon
piccies you see when you choose a gun), also Leon, who made a map for
us also helped with some sounds and textures. The main idea behind
this project was to try and capture the real life experience of a
Counter-Terrorist elite unit. I know, I know... you`re probably
wondering  when was the last time you played a game of CS that even
remotely resembled CT tactics (let`s hope to god CT`s don`t act like
that in real life!!) but I have played the odd rare game where people
were moving as a team (I tend to follow behind someone so as to use
him as a human shield.. works great!) and it felt really great...The
one thing I noticed though is, even though I provide the weapons which
were designed to give covering fire (sniper rifles, M249 LMG), no one
really uses them that way.. Well, aside from the sniper rifles
(although I`ve seen people running around using them as if they were
some kind of railgun) , I have yet to see anyone use the M249
effectively.. Perhaps, it`s because everyone feels that it`s too
boring sitting back and waiting for the action to come to you (oh wait
a minute, isn`t that what campers do? ... hmm.. scratch that thought).</font></td></tr>

for being not quite up to par with Quake2 in terms of bandwidth
efficiency. Oh why oh why couldn`t they have just used the Quake2
netcode.. arghhh.. everything else was so beautiful, so perfect.. but 
this one thing... BUT since I have a cable modem, it`s not that bad if
I find a good server :)</font></td></tr>

to urge the server ops to have a no mercy attitiude towards these
freaks of nature. With the new BETA 2.0, the percentage to kick
someone has been dropped to 63% (I forgot the significance of this
number but it WAS well thought out, I can assure). Ultimately, I`ll
never get rid of  ALL of them, we just have to be content with the
fact that they`re *fairly uncommon*  (that`s relative to what server
you play on).</font></td></tr>

likewise what has been most rewarding?</font></td></tr>
	 <tr><td><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#a0a108">Answer:</font> The most difficult aspect would definately have to listen to all the
whining about the gameplay features and the bugs, and every other
thing that people feel doesn`t quite jive. I mean, for cripes sakes, I
can understand if you paid good money for this.. but if people truly
believe that I`m obliged to even fix these bugs (which I try to :),
address these gameplay flaws, etc... then they really have to think
twice about that. Another gripe I have is, the sheer amount of mail I
get... It`s simply unmanageable.. heck, I don`t even bother to read
half of them anymore, I just quickly skim through the author and
subject and pick a few at random. It`s insanity man!  <sigh> well,
that`s off my chest, I guess I should say something nice about making
this MOD.. hmmm... (/me scratches head). It would have to be being
able to play this MOD, It`s very satisfying to get in a game and
experience the thrill of CT combat (even if it is only <insert
luidcrously low number>% accurate).</font></td></tr>

do remember it made a hellish sound.. I used to turn it on at night
and scare my little cousins.. My favourite game? heheh. funny you
should ask... I`d have to say Counterstrike (no, I`m not being bias:)
.. well, isn`t it obvious, If someone devotes this much time to making
a game for free, you`d have to expect he damn well loves it! But
before CS, I`d have to say my fave game was Ultima7 (I used to love
killing Britannians in their sleep .. muhaha.. I remember one time I
stole a couple of horses and rode into Lord British`s castle at 3
o`clock in the morning.. and then I`d surround his whole bed with
furniture in the hopes that he wouldn`t be able to get out.. after
laughing for several hours, I`d leave the castle and come back at
dinner time only to see him still wandering around on his bed! It was
a hoot.. and one time I brought a cannon into his bedroom.. hahah..
don`t let me start on that..)</font></td></tr>
