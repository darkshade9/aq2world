I was rather saddened to read IRC logs of statements made by several long standing members of the AQ2 community.  In these, they bad-mouthed BWAQSL administration, several of the teams in it, and some of the decisions taken by the "council" of admins.
<p>
I am one of the "council" and took many of the comments made personally.  I give up several hours a week to admin this league and know that some members of the council part with considerably larger chunks of their time.  As a result, I feel it necessary to defend myself and my collegues in a public forum and let others be aware of the crap that you have to take trying to help out a community!
<p>
The logs themselves, one of which covers 4 hours of repeated arguing of the same points, state a number of critisisms of the league and its running, and make several personal attacks against members of the council and teams who play within it.
<p>
These logs are widely available, so I will not post them here, but the points that were made can be summarised below:
<p>
1) The council is biased, consisting of only two division 1 clans, DP and RaP3 and no representation from the other 
clans/divisions except the odd token member to keep people happy.
2) DI (but RoAr, DP and KiL were also mentioned in the same category) are camping scum who make the game dull 
and boring, lack skill, and should be relegated to division 2.
3) Camping is exploiting the rules to win and should therefore be called cheating.  Any teams caught using this 
tactic should therefore be penalised.
4) A division 1 team was unfairly docked points for illegal 
players early in the season and this affected their ability 
to go on and win this season. The council are hence rigging 
the matches to let RaP3 (who has council members) win.
<p>
I did intend to look at each of these points and discuss them 
at some length.  Then I thought again and decided that all of 
them were in fact so ludicrous that I would be wasting my 
time bothering to address them.
<p>
The one comment I will make is to refer all reading this back 
to the BWAQSL website where I posted a long argument 
discussing points deducted in week 1.  In this update, 
entitled "About the Playerlist Rule" I stated:
<i>
`Previous organisers of this league have been judged as 
making poor, or biased decisions in the past, and I would 
hate for the council to be described as unjust so early in 
this new league. Therefore, if anyone has reservations about 
the decision made here, or feels that [DP] have excessive 
players on the council for no good reason, then please feel 
free to air your concerns to me via e-mail.`
</i>
<p>
I think I received 4 or 5 e-mails/ICQ messages after this 
statement, all of which offered their support on the 
council`s decisions and many of which thanked the people who 
take the time to run the league for their efforts.  Not one 
made a single negative comment!
<p>
Clearly no one had a problem with the council then; why is it 
now that we hear strong objections from one small corner of 
the league?  My only suggestions is that because they lost 
division 1, they have now decided to throw their rattles out 
of the pram.
<p>
As a final comment, during the course of both of these IRC 
logs, the persons stating their concerns strongly hinted that 
they should be on the council and that if they were, the 
league would be so much better run!
<p>
Clearly their lack of any sort of a clue is an indication how 
appropriate they are for council status!  Or am I completely 
wrong - does their random ranting show the sort of clear 
thinking and objectivity that people would like to run a 
highly successful, well sponsored league?
<p>
I will say no more at this point, but leave it up to everyone 
reading this to decide what they think.  BWAQSL will start 
season 2 in a few weeks and if there is a problem with the 
way I, or the council have handled this season, then I would 
like to know now.
<p>
Therefore, if anyone has comments, either good or bad, 
regarding anything related to this seasons BWAQSL and its 
organisation, then please feel free to mail or ICQ me.

I have to say that on the face of it, there appears to be very little Action related news and I am going to use this as an excuse for my lack of posts (slacker that I am :-). The A-Team have made no updates for well over a year, I don’t believe the MapDepot have posted a new map for months and no-one is currently working on bots or anything else for Action.
<p>
Basically, everyone who is anyone has moved over to playing the ‘oh so wonderful’ Counter-Strike, all proclaiming what a revolutionary idea it is, many not even aware that Action Quake not only created the genre the CS sits in, but also was the program that one of the lead Counter-Strike developers cut his teeth making.
<p>
This was really brought home to me at i5, where sitting in a lonely huddle of the 20 or so die-hard Action players, Counter-Strike people would regularly wander over and ask what the hell were we playing?  Many would say, ‘oh that’s Quake – its not realistic, is it?’ or ‘Where’s the rocket launcher?’.  One of the members of the top Counter-Strike team, KMA, who slaughtered DP in the CS tourney and went on to claim the weekend’s tournament title, can even be quoted to say ‘Action Quake… that’s a newbies’ game!’.
<p>
So is it true?  Are we all desperately clinging onto an already dead game which requires only basic newbie skills to master?  Or is there life in the old girl yet?  Personally Action has lots of life left in it yet!  I’m still playing it after 2 years and to me Counter-Strike is half the game that Action is.  Sure CS is prettier, has more variety of guns to choose from and promotes camping, oops, I mean team-play, but most of the time it’s dull, dull, dull!
<p>
I want the option to charge in, heavy automatic blazing, taking a laser-sight over Kevlar and hence sacrificing protection for manoeuvrability and accuracy... I want to settle down in my nice cosy vest and wait for them to come to me, boomstick in hand... I want to be able to do flying kicks to the head, and most of all, while bouncing over the tree-tops at break neck pace, I want to be able to throw, yes throw a knife into someone’s head.
<p>
Action is very much still alive.  Two public servers are almost always well populated with a third catching the over-spill.  A small team of dedicated fans are policing the servers to prevent the inevitable cheating that goes on, as meanwhile another team attempt to work with the old source code and fix as many of the cheats and exploits as possible.  Finally there is BWAQSL; a huge, well-run league already into its fourth season, catering for just as many clans as the CS equivalent.
<p>
As the head of division 1, I have watched both fast paced, full assault games, and slower, more team-orientated waiting sessions and to me the variety of team-styles seems far more developed than Counter-Strike.  From what I have seen first hand, Counter-Strike maps almost always favour one team, hence when playing matches, your aim is to get more than 5 rounds ahead while on the dominant side, then when you are playing the inferior side, waste time fast enough to not loose all of this lead before the timelimit is hit.
<p>	
Saying all this, DP are about to start in division 4 of the BWCSL and I do look forward to playing matches in a game other than Action.  I enjoyed our brief, if disastrous, flurry into Quake 3 CTF simply because it was a different game and similarly, I am sure that CS will be fun to play as a new game.
<p>
Since DP blew its chances of winning BWAQSL this season (loosing our home-map to both DI and bl33t – well played lads) we have decided to have fun for the rest of the season and not worry about any results.  This leaves us free to practice CS for the other league and I hope we will have some good results.  I’ll try not to bore you with them in this column… this is after all an Action site – or rather lack of Action site if I my update rate is anything to go by.
<p>
As a final comment, all I’d like to say to KMA if any of them gets to read this is... if AQ2 is a newbies’ game, come and play one of the division 1 AQ2 clans and show us how easy it is.  We’d be more than happy to show you what we can do with guns that actually kill the opposition with one good clean shot and a game where whether you hit someone doesn’t seems to depend on which way the wind is blowing, or whether you have sacrificed a chicken to the great god, Gooseman prior to the game.
<p>
CS isn`t the only game out there people - keep them BWAQSL seasons coming!

i5 is nearly upon us and I for one booked up for this event today.  I was 
sad to see that there are only about 20 people so far booked in the Action 
Quake/Half-Life area and about half of those are [DP] or friends there of.
Is this an indication that AQ2 is dying?  I hope not!
<p>
Come on guys.. get your arses over to the <a href="http://www.multiplay.co.uk" 
title="Multiplay">Multiplay</a> site and <a href="http://www.multiplay.co.uk/i-series/i_signup.html" 
title="i5 signup">sign up</a> for the event (four days of solid gaming... 
25th to 28th August).
<p>
Rumour has it if there is enough people in this area you will get me as a 
Tourney Admin for the weekend.  I`ll make sure there is plenty of events 
organised.
