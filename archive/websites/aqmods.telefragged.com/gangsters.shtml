It's the '70es... Gangsters controls the streets, and they are
at war. Funky ppl, with funky clothes, listening to funky music.
It's AQ:Gangsters, one of the mod for THE mod, Action Quake 2<br>
<br>
This new teamplay mod is just great. It forces you to play as a
team, and it's great fun too! Lots of new radio commands brings
teamplay to another level.<br>
<br>
The main objectives of the game are like this:<br>
Kill the other teams crime boss or escort your own crime boss to
his destination without getting him killed.<br>
<br>
In AQ:G you respawn after a certain period of observer mode. The
length of this is based on how you play. If you play like the game
wants you to, teamplay, you respawn faster, while if you go ahead
like a killing machine, you get penalties on you repawn time.<br>
<br>
The boss is the main figure here. To become the boss you got to
let the server know you want to be the boss, so players with no
experience at all can't be the boss and ruin the game for the rest.
Also, the boss has got some new commands, like: assassin and scout
assign. If you become a scout, you don't get a penalty on your
spawntime if you die outside the safezones. The assassin command is
only usable when playing with two bosses. The player selected as an
assassin should get over to the other teams HQ and try to kill the
enemy crime boss.<br>
<br>
To further enchance teamplay, AQ:Gangsters adds a location system.
Adding some simple % variables to your chat messages, you can easy
let your teammates know where you are, without having to memorize
each maps locationconfigs. The new variables are %L, which displays
your current location, and %S, which is the sighted location.<br>
f.eks:<br>
say_team Enemy spotted %S, might look like this:<br>
([R7]SICK1): Enemy spotted in Chinatown<br>
<br>
AQ:G has also got a bunch of new skins, and a model just introduced
to action, the Velvet Jackson. This funky figure is one of the coolest
models I've ever seen. With his disco moves and stuff... man I LOVE HIM!<br>
<br>
Another cool thingie is it's birth. This moment happened on a messageboard
up in the cold Norway. The A-team had the original idea, but they thought
it would be too unbalanced, but now it's here, and it's alive, expanding
all the time. Thetightt community up in scandinavia is just great. I'd
like to quote a friend of mine, Ellusion[NW]:<br>
<br>
<i>The NW server atnighth is like the Cheers bar 'where everybody
knows your name'. Regulars come at certain times,
everybody knowseach otherr and so on.</i><br>
<br>
The nw server is the test server for AQ:G and all the scandinavian players
stop by there from time to time. <br>
<br>
This is a mod all of you should try right now! So get your sorry ass
over to: <a href="http://www.plantequake.com/gangsters">www.plantequake.com/gangsters</a> and start doin' a lot of
gangsta shit!
