              <p>First a bit of news. As most of you undoubtedly know I am now 
                working at the AHLMD. I am also now working an ungodly amount 
                of hours at my real life job, which is obviously going to cut 
                into my free time. I am not sure at this point what the relationship 
                between the 2 sites will be. I'll post more on this at a later 
                date. </p>
              <p>Ok I am putting up the much awaited hospital map <a href="http://www.mapzone.net/maps/ahl/clinic1.zip">clinic1</a> 
                from Promagnon. I also have Bulletbait's new map <a href="http://www.mapzone.net/maps/ahl/bbcity.zip">bbcity</a>. 
              </p>
              <p>Please note linux hates uppercase filenames so please have all

              <p>Woohoo, Oddjob finally made a showing at the lan I co-host. Got 
                to see Krycheck beat him to a bloody pulp too. Have to give him 
                some credit though, he was playing on my machine, with a trackball, 
                and as an lpb for the first time. We spent quite a bit of time 
                playing AHL beta 3 and a good time was had by all. For anybody 
                who lans out there I do want to pass on this tidbit, The internet 
                connection sharing program that ships with Win98 second edition 
                is pretty damn hot. Once you have it set up it will act as a DHCP 
                (automatic ip's) server for the lan. If you have a spare system 
                it's well worth setting up for a lan, it improved network performance 
                tremendously. </p>
              <p>I noticed this morning that Bartender had madee a pretty positive 
                post about beta 2.5 on the BS board. Since this was his first 
                time playing AHL, that was good to hear. It seems more and more 
                old timers are trickling over from AQ and I predict with the release 
                of Beta 3, Action Half-life will convert even more players over. 
              </p>
              <p>I do have a new map for you guys in the form of <a href="http://www.mapzone.net/maps/ahl/bxht.zip">bxht</a> 
                from BunnyX. I actually got it sometime last week, but I have 
                just been to preoccupied with other things.</p>

              <p>Hadn't realized it had been this long since I updated. Well I 
                want to take care of some actual news before I get on to the new 
                maps. There are apparently some problems at the site I was using 
                to store my AQ2 maps and well the mirror I had setup, isn't there. 
                Not quite sure what's gonna happen, but it may be awhile until 
                I find another server to house the maps. Following this topic 
                a bit farther along, I will also be taking the unofficial maps 
                down due to a lack of space. Anything on the unofficial list that 
                you need feel free to email me and I will send it to you.</p>
              <p>The lack of space is due in part to the growing number of AHL 
                maps. (which we should be seeing even more of soon) I have also 
                recently encountered the Great Conflict, ie. finding a balance 
                between gaming, school and work. Notice I did not include sleep. 
                It also turns out that I am paying a bit more attention in class 
                (at 14 grand a year you can be damn sure I am going to pay attention.)</p>
              <p>Last week KaRRiLLioN, gave me and many others a chance to help 
                beta test his new map Actrail, and I gotta say this map kicks 
                ass, and uh Karr, HURRY UP. heheh. Since I have also spent a fair 
                amount of time playing innercity2 I can say this about it... it 
                huge, easily one of the biggest maps I have ever played. I can 
                see a whole bunch of possibilities for this maps when goals are 
                included in Beta3.</p>
              <p>I'm going to go ahead an put <a href="http://www.mapzone.net/maps/ahl/ahl_metro.zip">ahl_metro</a> 
                (by Lodo) up for download, one thing with this map is that the 
                tfc wad is required to play it. If you don't know already this 
                is the first map made available with the goals activated, its 
                uses he rule set from the &quot;hunted&quot; scenarios for TFC.</p>
              <p>I have also added a map that has actually been out for awhile 
                and is just now reaching the Mapzone... <a href="http://www.mapzone.net/maps/ahl/110THST.zip">110ThSt</a> 
                by Zebedee. I also just had <a href="http://www.mapzone.net/maps/ahl/hotel2.zip">hotel2</a> 
                sent to me by DrumDude.</p>
              <p>One last thing before I finish up for tonight; Hal9k has asked 
                me to pass on some very important info to the mappers out there. 
                When creating your zip files, make sure the bsp's are in lower 
                case, Linux users have a problem with uppercase letters so he 
                would appreciate it if you would comply with this. </p>

              <p>Time for the first set of AHL maps. 3 of the maps have been around 
                for awhile, and the other I just received. The newest map is a 
                remake of the infamous Action Q2 map Dirt, titled slayn1. The 
                other 3 maps are <a href="http://www.mapzone.net/maps/ahl/dwcave.zip">dwcave</a>,

                made by Dan Watts, The Octave Doctor!, and SithManiac&amp;timm 
                respectively. </p>
              <p>Right now it's hard to say when I will be getting the rest of 
                the AQ2 maps up. But they should show up eventually.</p>
              <p>Well back to fraggin. Btw I just wanted to say hi to all the 
                guys that play on Georgia Tech server, that seems to be where 
                its at right now.</p>

                taking an active interest in the site again. As most of you can 
                see the site has changed its look, some of you will recall that 
                this is the original layout. I thnk I am going to be keeping it 
                this way for awhile.</font></p>
              <p><font color="999999">Archives are way the hell out of date, and 
                due to the abundance of maps in the last 4 months, its going to 
                take me some time to get all the updates in.</font></p>
              <p>Primary focus in the next few days will be setting up an AHL 
                map section. My goal is to set up a reliable place to download 
                maps, nothing more, nothing less. Submission rules will be the 
                same as with the AQ2 maps. Like before, I will not be doing any 
                testing and any comments will be based off of my personal opinion. 
              </p>
              <p>I apologize to all of you who have sent me maps in the last few 
                months, I have just been occupied on other projects. I should 
                be able to begin updateing regularly once again.</p>
