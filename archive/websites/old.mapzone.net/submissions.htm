    <p>First off, I will accept no beta test maps unless they come from, or are 
      brought to my attention by the mapper. Now, I would also suggest that all 
      maps are also sent to the AQMD. The AQMD plays an important part in the 
      Action community, they test maps; I don't. Please remember that the testers 
      at AQMD are all experienced players and quite a few are mappers. All they 
      can do is help you.</p>
    <p>If you have no intention of submitting the map to AQMD please explain the 
      reasons to me, as I keep in contact with the AQMD staff it would be helpful 
      for me to know.</p>
    <p>I am not worried about &quot;illegal&quot; textures, but the use of them 
      will keep you from getting the map tested at AQMD and will also result in 
      your map not being included in any future AQ2-related CD-ROMs that may be 
      provided to the public by the AQ2 team."</p>
    <p>If the map is to be submitted to both the AQMD and the MapZone, I would 
      ask that you follow the <a href="http://aqmd.telefragged.com/mmaps.html" target="">submission 
      guidelines</a> setup by the AQMD. In addittion to these guidelines I would 
      ask that you also include something in the name that signifies that the 
      map is a beta. A good example of this is Vertigo, which was first submitted 
      as Vertigo_1h. The name of the zip should be changed as well as the name 
      of the .bsp. </p>
    <p>If you come across a map that looks good, but wasn't designed specifically 
      for Action let me know. Send me an <a href="mailto:Shagg@mapzone.net">email</a> 
      and include a brief description and a place I can download the map, also 
      include the authors name if possible.</p>
    <p>Screen Shot Submissions: I am still looking for screen shots. Here's what 
      I want:<br>
      1. all shots should be on empty maps.<br>
      2. all shots should be renamed after the map.<br>
      3. I reserve the right to crop and edit the shots as I see fit, mostly this 
      is just for adjusting the file size.</p>
