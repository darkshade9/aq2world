Unzipping Maps: By Framer 
<p>Now that we know where to get all the maps (You are at the MapZone if you're 
  reading this), we need to know what to do with them. Always unzip maps to you're 
  &quot;Quake2/Action&quot; directory! As some of you know (and most AQ2'ers will 
  certainly eventually find out), when you unzip maps some of them were not correctly 
  done in respect to putting their files in the correct folders. This will turn 
  your &quot;Action&quot; folder, and sub folders into a cluster%#@% from hell. 
  Some of them even create new &quot;Quake2&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;, &quot;Env&quot;, 
  &quot;Maps&quot;, &quot;Sound&quot;, and &quot;Textures&quot; folders that just 
  clutter up your hard drive and slow down access to these files. If you like 
  to keep a clean clutter free easily accessed &quot;Action&quot; folder as I 
  do, here is a short tutorial as to how you can clean up that psychotic mess, 
  and to where all those nasty stray folders/files actually need to go. If you're 
  hurting for hard drive space this may help some as I currently have a total 
  of 97 maps. There is no reason to have duplicate folders/files in your &quot;Quake2/Action&quot; 
  folders as the A-Team have set up all the folders you need in the AQ2 game download. 
  Remember to always unzip maps to your &quot;Quake2/Action&quot; directory. Do 
  Not add an extension as in &quot;Quake2/Action/MAPS! That will only add another 
  folder you have no use for. 
<p>Duplicate Folders
<p>When you encounter duplicate folders IN your &quot;Quake2&quot; or &quot;Action&quot; 
  folders (cross check both) after unzipping maps to your &quot;Quake2/Action&quot; 
  directory, the easy way to delete duplicate folders/files is to open 2 windows, 
  one the original folder (probably the largest) and 2nd the duplicate folder. 
  This process is also used for folders within duplicate folders. Open both folders 
  in the 2 windows, and look at the files. If all of the files in the duplicate 
  folder are already in the original folder, you can delete the duplicate folder. 
  If some or all of the files in the duplicate folder are NOT in the original 
  folder, click and drag them to the original folder. Some duplicate folders will 
  contain files already in the original folder, and some files that are not. If 
  your not sure (too many to read through) simply click and drag each file to 
  the original folder. If the file already exists in the original folder, you 
  will be asked if you want to replace the file with the one from the duplicate 
  folder. Always use the newest/largest file. Be sure you drag the files to an 
  empty place in the original folder window or it will not work. If the duplicate 
  folder contains files that are not in the original folder, simply click and 
  drag them all to the original folder. Once you have determined that all the 
  files in the duplicate folders are now or were in the original folders, delete 
  the duplicate folders. No need to delete individual files since by now you have 
  ascertained that all files in the duplicate folder were in or have been transferred 
  to the original folders.
<p>Stray Files/Correct folders for File Types
<p>This section is for making sure your files are in the correct folders. Most 
  importantly is where to put those pesky stray files that show up in your &quot;Quake2&quot; 
  and &quot;Action&quot; folders that belong in their respective folders, but 
  due to oversight by map designers have been loaded into the larger, general 
  folders instead (I have seen a lot of this, they all have a place to go, they 
  just don't always get routed/unzipped to their respective/correct folders). 
  The most common (all that I have seen) file types and the respective folders 
  they should be in are as follows: * Please note that the file names used are 
  the file extensions!
<p>Most Common misdirected files upon unzipping:<br>
  The ones I have seen the most often besides the obvious duplicate &quot;Quake2, 
  Action (some), Env, Maps, Sound, and Textures (most of the problem) folders 
  are txt/readme and .bsp files that load into the 'Quake2&quot; or &quot;Action&quot; 
  folders rather than their intended destination for some unknown reason. These 
  text/readme and .bsp files need to be put in their correct/respective folders. 
<p>Always unzip maps to the &quot;Quake2/Action&quot; directory. The files are 
  supposed to go where they need to be if the map author has done his job correctly. 
  But alas, if a serious cleanup after the map designers work wasn't needed, I 
  wouldn't be writing this boring piece of text. 
<p>Env folder: The files that belong in this folder will have the file name (extension) 
  &quot;pcx, tga, tmp, or bmp&quot; in upper or lower case (silly huh? Where the 
  conformity? But then again, see the above comment on map designers).
<p>Maps folder: The files that belong in this folder will have the file name (extension) 
  &quot;bsp&quot; always in lower case (so far). Note! Most txt/readme files for 
  maps will also load into the Maps folder, see the txt/readme section that follows!
<p>Textures folder: The files that belong in this folder will have the file name 
  (extension) &quot;wal&quot; always in lower case (so far). Note! When disassembling 
  duplicate folders, some new or different &quot;wal&quot; files will come in 
  or with duplicate textures folders. Example: textures/wally folder. This texture 
  folder is named in more than one map compilation but that doesn't mean there 
  isn't a new or different &quot;wal&quot; file you need in one of them. Open 
  both folders in 2 windows to cross check as stated above! Very common problem! 
  Many map designers borrow (not rip off) textures from other maps. It's imperative 
  that you cross check these files!
<p>Sound and Sounds folders: The files that belong in this folder (Sound) will 
  have the file name (extension) &quot;wav&quot; always in lower case (so far). 
  These &quot;wav&quot; files only need one folder to call home, the most obvious/popular 
  is Sound. I believe the Sounds folder was created by a map designer or two's 
  spelling errors (extra &quot;s&quot; at the end of the folder name) considering 
  there is only 2 &quot;wav&quot; files in the sounds folder that are not included 
  in the Sound folder of hundreds involved. Cross check them, and delete Sounds. 
<p>Txt/Readme files: Most of these files are named &quot;(map name here)txt&quot; 
  As in &quot;Urban3 txt&quot;. Most of them load into &quot;Quake2/Action/maps&quot; 
  along with the .bsp files but some load into &quot;Quake2/Action&quot; along 
  with or without their misdirected .bsp files. You can read and delete them, 
  or if you really want to save them put them in &quot;Quake2/docs&quot;. That 
  way you'll know where to find them. Not to say don't read them, some contain 
  valuable gaming info pertaining to their map. Then some like the map &quot;the 
  Towel is a perfect example of why you should read all txt/readme files if you 
  expect it to run. But for the most part you can read em and delete em. No flag 
  on the play. As long as you credit the map author.
<p>To Reiterate: <br>
  pcx, tga, tmp, and bmp files belong in the Env folder.<br>
  bsp files belong in the Maps folder. <br>
  wal files belong in the Textures folder.<br>
  wav files belong in the Sound folder.
<p>In closing, all I can say is it's a mess thanks to some of the map designers. 
  But on the other hand it's easier to fix than it is to design a map! My thanks 
  go out to all the level designers that care enough to bring more to the AQ2 
  experience! 
<p>Regards, Framer.
