<br />Alrighty then, about half a year after the idea was presented it's finally ready. The project was started somewhere around january or february of this year after some crazy talk while, well, being not so sober. So in a nutshell it's a new version of cliff2, which I hope would be even less merciful than the original. We got the permission from cliff2's author Ace12GA almost immediately, but it took 2-3 months before we got our hands on his original cliff2.map file, from where I started to make the modifications. So big thanks to Ace12GA! Wonder if you already gave up hope since we were silent for so long or even forgot the whole thing <img src="./images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />You really can't find that much of anything old from this map, all the textures and sounds have been acquired from sites offering them for free and most of them are modified at least to some extent or made from a scratch. So I presume that you play it with the .jpg and .png textures (supported by AprQ2, NoCheat and R1Q2 at least) even though I actually used some effort in making the .wal textures this time.
<br />
<br />Thanks to MarlPoro for the idea, testing and the graphics of the signs. Oh and we shall see if there will be an alternative .wav file for one of the sound clips of this map in the future.

<br />And the map you can acquire from the following link, at least until it has been added to some bigger sites:
