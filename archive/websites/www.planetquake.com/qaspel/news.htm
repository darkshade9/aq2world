<font size="+0"><b>3-19-99:</b></font> Okay, the main updates for the demos page is over.  I got a big demo pack from a clan match in Singapore coming this weekend.  Plus a couple of strays here and there that need to get posted.  Then I'm all caught up.
<p>I had an email about converting demos over into AVI videos, I don't know how to do this though.  If anyone out there knows how to convert demos over to AVI or MOV format let me know.  Preferably I'd like to do MOV for Quicktime 3.0 cause it's clean but whatever works is good.  Let me know if you know how to do this.
<p>Not much else is going on, I'm working on some graphics stuff to experiment around with Photoshop that I may put up later, I may have to remove the company name though.  Or I could stick it on some other web space... more on that later.
<p>I've been getting tons of demos of tricks and tips for The Edge (q2dm1.bsp).  You know, this map kind of sucks though.  It's okay, but it's so damn washed up.  I got a tip for ya, it works on this map and every other map I've ever played: KILL EVERYONE.

<p><font size="+0"><b>3-16-99:</b></font> Wow, it's been ahile hasn't it? Anyway, got 3 new demos up, all Action Quake 2 Capture the Briefcase demos.  This mod kicks alot of ass.  I will be posting a bunch of submitted demos tomorrow night, for the rest of the night I plan on playing some guitar.
<p>That reminds me, the <a href="test.htm">Testing Area</a> has been updated with my complete studio list.  I don't think I've left anything out.  I will be putting up pictures of everything sometime this week.
<p>The new <a href="tech.htm">Technical Support</a> page is doing quite well.  Got some good stuff going up there now.  Stuff I do around the lab, and the transcripts and sounds of stupid customers.  If you haven't checked it out yet, then get with it!
<p>Also updated the <a href=links.htm>Links</a> page with some links!  Also available is a button you can use to link my site.  If you'd like to be linked to my site, let me know.  My email link is up above in the nav-bar.

<p><font size="+0"><b>2-24-99:</b></font> Well it's time to phase in the new look.  I have new demos as well which I need to prep in order to post, so that will probably happen by Friday night.
<p>The general layout itself has not changed too much, just some new graphics, ditched some of the old pages and in general tried to streamline things.  <a href="submit.htm">Demo Submission</a> requirements have changed so check that out.  I am taking bigger demos, but I am also requiring them to be prepped by you instead of me to speed things up.
<p>The new <a href="tech.htm">Technical Support</a> section may seem like it's dragging, but the weird part is although it's been insane at work, there hasn't been too many funny incidents to relay.  This will change though, it goes in bursts.

<p><font size="+0"><b>2-17-99:</b></font> Got a bunch of new demo submissions from some cool people, including some tourney matches in Singapore! These will be posted soon, along with the new look which is mostly what I am working on right now.
<p>For now however I have something new for you.  <a href="tech.htm">Technical Support</a> is a new page which has replaced the now defunct FAQ section.  In Technical Support you will see the type of pissant issues I get to deal with, the hilarity and futility of working in tech support and maybe once in awhile: the joy of being a technician... NOT!
<p>Also I have the new main Navigation Banner I will be using shortly.  This will be on the main page only, a smaller version will be on the other pages.  Due to some other changes I will be making I will be changing the banner a little bit.  But what you see posted in the <a href="test.htm">Testing Area</a> for 2-17-99 is basically what you will see in use.  None of the links are operational on what I have posted in the Testing Area however.
<p>I am now considering taking submissions for Half-Life demos.  If some of you are interested in maybe doing this, email me and tell me what you've got and also put together a readme.txt file on how to play them.  I don't have the time myself.  What I will probably do is just take a complete zipped submission with the readme.txt file in it and post it directly on my site.  I will ponder this matter over coffee and your feedback...

<p><font size="+0"><b>1-23-99:</b></font> Jumped up on a few servers, turned out one of them was in Denmark.  Had some lag but not too bad, I thought it was net congestion, then there's all these crazy Scandanavians on there and I'm tripping out.  Turns out when I sign off I notice it was in Denmark.  Go figure
<p>Yup, just downloaded 60 cool fonts so I can play around with some buttons and graphics for the site.  I'm making a "Quake II Training Demos" button for anyone who wants to link my site, <a href="mailto:qaspel@planetquake.com">email</a> me if you want one.  It will be ready by Friday.
<p>Cleaned my room today, took out 5 garbage bags worth of junk I don't need anymore and probably would not be able to sell, even on E-Bay.  It's amazing how much junk one can accumulate in a year!
<p>I have also decided to divide the demos section up into two sections, my demos and everyone else's.  This will take place when the new look gets phased in, probably in a couple of weeks.  The demos I've been sitting on that people sent me over the last couple of months will be posted then as well.  So if you sent me a demo and haven't seen it up here yet, don't go postal, it's going to be here.

<p><font size="+0"><b>1-22-99:</b></font> Okay so what have I been up to?  Well alot of work, as usual.  Building up massive callouses on my fingers from playing guitar.  Oh yeah, I'm doing some new stuff with graphics and some other ideas so I'm throwing a few things up over on the new <a href="test.htm">Testing Area</a> page.  Stuff will be temporary but interesting.  Or maybe not.
<p>Trying to get some new demos done but I keep getting crappy ones.  I think I might be losing my touch or something.  Music always takes up so much time from my computer, and it's 3 times as expensive.  Oh well, what we sacrifice for the sake of art (GAG!)
<p>Not much else to report.  So I guess I'll close out by saying <i>"This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all. If we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live by the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin."</i> - 1 John 1:5-7

<p><font size="+0"><b>1-16-99:</b></font> Wow, long time... Too long... Well anyway I'm back.  I'm no longer confined to a 28.8K modem anymore either.  Got hooked up with DSL out here on a 144K connection.  They plan to offer 1.1MB "soon" and when they do, I'm getting it!  Still I can't complain too much, got some system upgrades, a faster, more stable connection and I'm kicking ass as usual.
<p>So what's up with the site?  Good question, I have a couple of answers.  I'm going to start playing around with a new layout, graphics, maybe even a little Shockwave.  It's going to take a couple of months but it will look good.
<p>Got some new demo submissions in, thanks to those of you who sent them in, you will be seeing them posted shortly.  I just haven't had much time to play Quake lately much less check out demos.  I myself will not be recamming any demos, except for maybe once in a great while, as I just don't have the time right now.  I switched companies back in October, no longer with EFA Corporation anymore, now I'm with Shark Multimedia Inc. instead.  It's pretty cool, I have the same desk but I'm also getting a bigger paycheck.  I have also gone out and kind of gotten myself a social life.  So not so much time for Quake anymore, but hey, I'm not going anywhere just yet.
<p>You know, I think I'm going to just kill the news page.  Stick all this stuff on the main one and ditch that "analyze blah blah blah" crap.  It's getting kind of old.  Anyway, if anyone actually reads this, or reads this far, I'm back, I will be making more updates while I work on the new site, and if you see me out on some servers... RUN THE OTHER WAY!
