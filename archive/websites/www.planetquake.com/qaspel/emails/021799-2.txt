RE: 	 ISA 56k HSP modem

To whom it may concern:

I have recently installed a new 56k HSP modem ( ISA ),  and I am
having
a little problem that I hope you can help me with.

The modem works fine, I amrunning the Telephony App software, and America Online
as
well.

If i run Telephony App, fax and voice is all ok, but when i close Telephony App
and either open AOL or run modem diagnostics I get a  Blue Screen with this
message: An execption OE has occurred at 0028:C109116A in VXD-----This was
called from 0028:C3E45FOC in VXD 56k_DFU (01)+00001FOO.
after this comes up hitting the space bar reboots the computer and then it
works fine if I do not run Telephony App. this only happens if Telephony App is
running
and no calls are recieved, if I do get a call ( voice or fax ) this does not
happen.   Please Help!!!!
I have been to your website and followed the upgrade instructions and
downloaded and installed the latest drivers.
and also made sure that the unimodemV driver was installed.

My computer is configured as follows: Pentium motherboard w/512k l2 cache,
AMD
K6 233 mhz cpu, 32 meg sdram memory, 1.2 gig Eide hdd. 2 meg video,  16 bit
sound.
Runnig windows 95 4.00.95a.

Thank you for any help you can give me,
