What specifically does our documentation say?  Pentium and AMD?  I'm not
sure.  Send him the quote, and also that his we only can do replacements,
not returns.

Well so much for that.  Any suggestions on what I should tell this guy?
 I don't think the standard explanation of what "Pentium (R) PC 166MHz
or better" means is going to work with this guy.

RE: 	 Re: Inop 56k

If this modem is unuseable....why don't the setup box warn me of a
problem.
I got no such indication and THEREFORE this modem is useless to me as
doesn't function as good as my original 28.8.  Evergreen 200 MXPRO is
supposed to circumvent the problem your attachment cites per Evergreen.

HOW can I get out of this situation???  Take modem back! I spent so
much
time trying to get it to work, I can't return to source.
