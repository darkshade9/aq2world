Tech support is all about troubleshooting, trying this and trying that until
you find what the problem is.  The problem with tech support on PC's is
because it's a PC.  A nice wide-open platform with rapdily changing
technology for both hardware and software and nobody talks to anyone.  This
is why information is VERY critical to resolving the various issues that
WILL turn up on any particular PC.

What I suggest doing is that you go and download the drivers we posted two
weeks ago, chances are it will fix your issue:

http://www.xxxxx.com/download/drivers.htm

The file you need is v90sux-ass.exe

Run it, there's a readme.txt in it which has the installation instructions.

Now IF that does not work for you, then I will need the name of your ISP
and the dial up access number you use to connect to it.  w/o that
information I'm out of options.

[THIS IS THE ORIGINAL MESSAGE HERE]

Wonder if you could solve my modem problem.

I just brought a new  56k HSP modem and I 
follow the instructions on setting it up with the
latest driver downloaded from your website.

Here's the problem, seems like everytime I dial up to my 
ISP it would make the usual connection noises but it
would never be able to connect successfully.  If it
happens to connect, it would last maybe for 30 seconds
and then I would hear some buzz sound from the modem
which later disconnects me from the ISP.  I don't suspect
it's the line quality, because it was ok when I used
other modems to connect.  

My connection to the ISP was usually at 50666 and I know
my ISP supports v90 and Kflex.  I also found out that when
I connect to another ISP it connected at 53333 and it
connected succssfully, however I could hear click and pop
noises when it is connected.  The connection to this ISP 
lasted about 5 minutes longer and then I got disconnected.

I have tried to connect with both ISP many times.  Is there
something I don't know about HSP modems or did I made a
mistake buying this modem?

Somebody Helpme.
