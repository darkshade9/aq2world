<b>5-7-99</b> Uh oh... I had a meeting today.  <a href="emails/layoff.txt">The Meeting</a>.
	<ul>
		<li>Once you are finished reading that you will realize that this part of the site is now pretty much dead... hmmm... that sucks.  Well not to worry, Tech Support will live on to fight another day, the sooner the better, unemployment insurance in the state of California is pretty pathetic!
	</ul>
<p><b>3-17-99</b> Dude, emails emails emails... when will it ever end?  Anyway, here's something that's just stupid:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="emails/031799-1.txt">Issue #1</a> "Is there something I don't know about HSP modems or did I made a mistake buying this modem?"  No, actually I think someone made a mistake <i>selling you</i> an HSP modem.  I'm getting too old for this #$%@!
	</ul>

<hr align="CENTER" size="1" width="600" color="Gray">

<p><b>3-16-99</b> Well what do I have for you today?  Been playing around with graphics today, something that keeps me busy while talking to all the DFU's.  Here's a nice sample:
	<ul>
		<li><a href=images/v2.htm>Dual-chipset Vortex 2</a> soundcard.  This is a nice little promo I made up.  Notice the nice little typo I made, wish I'd saved the damn PSD!
	</ul>

<hr align="CENTER" size="1" width="600" color="Gray">

<p><b>3-12-99</b> Well the dentist deal wasn't so bad.  I even got to keep the tooth, maybe I'll sell it on E-Bay, there's always some freak out there who'll by something lame.
<p>Anyway folks, tech support is running smoothly, which means that the pissants start calling, here's a couple of voice mails for you guys:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="sounds/031299-1.mp3">Voice Mail #1</a> Sometimes someone thinks the world revolves around them.  Truth is, these people do great at replacing burnt out light bulbs.  If you know the joke you got it, if not...
		<li><a href="sounds/031299-2.mp3">Voice Mail #2</a> This one may sound boring at first, but the customer suggestion alone makes this a must to post!
	</ul>

<hr align="CENTER" size="1" width="600" color="Gray">

<p><b>3-3-99</b> Damn, I have to go to the dentist in 45 minutes to get some novacaine and then get a wisdom tooth pulled out.  This is going to suck!  Anyways, while tech support is still kind of boring right now, I will take the next few moments to exploit the opportunity to clarify a couple of things about hardware:
	<ul>
		<li><b>v.90</b> - Man does v.90 suck!  Things were actually better for modem users when there was only X2 and Flex, they're just too stupid to realize it yet.
		<li><b>A3D</b> - This sux too!  Yeah it's kind of cool to hear sounds all around you, except it does help me to know WHERE they are coming from.  A3D doesn't do a very good job of this.  "Positional Sound" my ass!
		<li><b>4 Speaker Support</b> - Now this is very cool.  Especially with surround sound.  My CD's & MP3's sound kick ass now on my system.  With games that support 4 speakers, I can actually hear where my opponents are coming from.  Beats the $%#@ out of A3D.
		<li><b>Winmodems</b> - Totally suck ass, but hey, if you're a gamer you already knew this.
		<li><b>AMD K6</b> - Why do these damn chips always keep frying??  It may cost me more, but my next system will be 100% Intel.
		<li><b>Cyrix</b> - BWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  If you even mention IDT or Evergreen I'm probably going to pee my pants with laughter.
		<li><b>RTFM</b> - Ever hear this acronym before?  Does it leave you mystified? It means "Read The F#%$ing Manual." Nuff said.
	</ul>

<hr align="CENTER" size="1" width="600" color="Gray">

<p><b>2-25-99</b> Is today Thursday?  Hmm... the calender won't stay still after that drinking cup of Black Oil I got from the coffee maker.  Anyway, new desk is all setup.  Properly messed up now.  Just wrote out 590 lines of HTML code from scratch for an email auto-reply.  If you don't have an HTML capable emailer then to hell with you anyway!<br>
<i>Tech Highlights:</i> Well there's just no shortage of lamers is there?  See the email below for a good example of this.  Talked to a couple of bozos, but otherwise nothing new to report.
	<ul>
		<li><a href="emails/022599-1.txt">Issue #1</a> Winmodems and online gaming?  Nope!  They just don't mix.  But does this guy listen?  Whatever dude, you can ride my rocket!
	</ul>

<hr align="CENTER" size="1" width="600" color="Gray">

<p><b>2-17-99</b> A damp and gray Wednesday morning.  Someone kept taking all the coffee and not making anymore.<br>
<i>Tech Highlights:</i> Had an interesting response to a couple of emails on unrelated issues.
	<ul>
		<li><a href="emails/021799-1.txt">Issue #1</a> concerned my inquiry to our VP as to how to deal with an irate customer who was using an HSP modem with a P.O.S. Evergreen processor.
		<li><a href="emails/021799-2.txt">Issue #2</a> was the response by our QA Engineer to my inquiry to a telephony application, HSP modem and AOL issue making the customer's system get a Blue Screen of Death and reboot.
