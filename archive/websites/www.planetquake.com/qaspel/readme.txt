HOW TO PLAY QUAKE II DEMO FILES
-------------------------------


INSTALLATION
------------
It's pretty easy, just put the *.dm2 file in a directory named "demos".

This demo directory is mod specific so if you're doing a regular deathmatch, no-mod game then put the *.dm2 file in the \baseq2\demos directory.

If you're playing a demo made in a mod, then you'll need to put the *.dm2 file in the appropiate subdirectory:

LMCTF Demos:		\baseq2\lmctf\demos
ID CTF Demos:		\baseq2\ctf\demos
Rocket Arena 2 Demos:	\baseq2\arena\demos
Mission Pack One Demos:	\baseq2\xatrix\demos

You get the picture.  Now to make it work:


PLAYING THE DEMO
----------------
Run Quake 2 and start a multiplayer server with default settings (this is to avoid the CD requirement if you want to play a music CD or something).

It may be necessary on some mods to even enter "set game <mod folder name>" at the console in order for the maps to load.

When the game starts, go to the console and type 'map <file name>.dm2'
Example:	map lm6-17.dm2

After entering the command, hit the tilde (~) key to close the console window when the demo starts.

If you're clever you can write a little batch file to do all this for you, something I may include in the future...


IMPORTANT FOR PLAYING DEMOS OF MODS
-----------------------------------
1.  You need to have the appropiate mod installed for the demo.
2.  Make sure you put the demo in the right directory, see the top if
    You need help with this.
3.  Makes sense that you would have to start Quake 2 running with the
    appropiate mod doesn't it?


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
The tilde key thing pisses me off how it interrupts demos, but it's pretty easy to get used to it.

Other than that there aren't any other issues.
