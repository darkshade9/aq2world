<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#CCCCCC"><FONT SIZE=-1>City is
a perfect Gangsters map with it's open layout and multiple routes to choose
from. A successful team can divide their forces between Escorting and diversions
- A successful Defense team have plenty of positions to open a big Can
of Whoop-Ass (tm) on the enemy boss when he arrives.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

first spawn and target. Players will spawn on top of the stairs in Clint
E alley with the PG sign and the backyard (spawn). When starting here without
a boss, your objective is to stop the enemy boss from reaching his target
on the rooftop (target). A good defense could consist of a couple snipers
on both the roof above the spawn point, and on the target roof. Add to
that some gangsters with automatics, covering the street and the backyard
and your mission should be simple. When the Escort party arrives have them
gunned down while counting bodies, then send out a hunter to finish off
the boss while he hurries back to the other spawn for more guards.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

gangsters to cover the street from the police station and the back alley.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

to Blockwar by Brian McClelland</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></CENTER>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#CCCCCC"><FONT SIZE=-1>Blockwar
is just the right size and also a classic. It does have a few "bugs" though,
so be careful. When opening the double doors to the gunshack and the hotel,
have a gangster do it instead of the boss since he might get stuck and
have to type kill in the console to release the doors.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#CCCCCC"><FONT SIZE=-1>The
first spawn and target is in the hotel. Players will spawn on the first
floor in room 101 (the first door on the right from target) and the target
is in the hall just next to the stairs leading up to the roof. Defending
this target is easily done with snipers on the roof, and guards at the
gate and garage ramp. Someone should also stick very close to the target
as the enemies can come from everywhere.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#CCCCCC"><FONT SIZE=-1>The
second spawn and target is in the gunshack and on it's roof. Players will
spawn right outside the door that leads down to the target in the end of
the hallway. Defending the target is best done in the "ambush-style" where
you hide until the enemy boss arrives and the spring on him from a number
of places like the bluish room, the roofs, and from outside. Even with
4-5 guards, the boss is subject to fire from 3 directions.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

first spawn and target is inside the factory building. Players will spawn
on the ledge outside the offices and the target is right underneath on
the walkway above the crates. Defending the factory can be done in numerous
ways, but most often happens from outside. Snipers on the roofs and streetlights,
and guards at the different entrances to the factory area.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

second spawn and target is in the bank area. Players spawn in the stairs
intersection and the target is centered inside the bank. Defend by getting
an overview of the area from the high ledge above bank and guards by the
two entrances. A popular tactic is to have one kamikaze guard waiting behind
the door inside the bank.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#CCCCCC"><FONT SIZE=-1>Although
being a slightly off-setting map, Teacher is a work of art as we've come
to expect from Ruskprick. Filled with hallways and tight areas. Teacher
offers a different form of gangster play where stealth, shotguns and close-combat
weapons dominate.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

first spawn and target is on the second floor. Players will spawn right
outside the principals office and the target is located around the desk
in the office. Defending can be a bit tricky, but is mostly concentrated
inside the office and the the close perimeter. A handy sneak shot at the
enemy boss can be taken from the airvent in the office.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

janitor's desk and the target is close, where the water heater is. Defending
is easy if you're quick, as the enemy will come from several angles. If
you can fire first you will stay on top due to the close quarters - if
not, they will be over you in no-time.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
