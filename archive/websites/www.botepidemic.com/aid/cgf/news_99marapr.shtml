 Working on patrolling has continued. A fire team is now capable of patrolling along
 number of (script defined) areas. The patrolling behaviors are a bit too predictable,
 and the transition (upon enemy contact) from patrolling to attack requires more work as well.
 <br><br>
 I finally started testing the bots on maps other than the 'street - rooftop - corner -
 ladder' urban style maps (such as city, urban, tokyo). I'm able to create a route file,
 and whip a up a small 'patrol' script in under 60 minutes for maps such as Museum and
 Teamjungle.
 <br><br>

<br>
 However, the bots ran into trouble (and so did I, of course) in their attempts
 to tackle the 'special features' of these maps. If we, as human players, have troubles in
 rapidly and reliably performing movements such as:
<UL>
 	<LI>going down through small (ladder equipped) manholes
 	<LI>dealing with doors that get in the way
 	<LI>mounting crate stacks
 </UL> 
 the bots will have even more troubles in performing these movements. That is, you can expect
 the bots to perform silly movements for a while without really getting anywhere.
 <br><br>
 On Teamjungle, a map at which it should be fun to snipe against some patrolling bot teams, it gets worse.
 Bots are able to get stuck 'underneath' a tree (and so was I). Here, a hint brush should have been
 applied. (Note that teamjungle's creator Timm still deserves lots of credits as the mapper who has done most
 for bots - he's one of Bot Epidemic's webmasters).

<br>
 It's too early to write down guidelines on creating 'bot compatible' maps. (I want to tweak the 
 bot movement code some more, and probably add a 'suicide' capability to resolve bots remaining
 stuck). However, any map feature that is difficult to deal with for high ping players will be
 difficult for the bots as well. Examples:
<UL>
	<LI>creative use of ladder textures (lamp posts, the horizontal drain pipes at tokyo, ladders in small pits)
	<LI>swing doors in cramped spaces
	<LI>far jumps to 'small' destinations (tree top jumps (teamjungle), crate stack jumps)
	<LI>protruding wall mounts (Museum's paintings)
</UL>
 <br>
 For most of the next two weeks, I'm on the road for some 'real life job action'. During those
 weeks I'm unable to do development, update the site, or reply my mail. However, 
 I'm taking along a (paper) notebook to record any bot related ideas...

 The last week, I've been (and still am) busy getting a fire team 
 to patrol a map the 'right' way. That means balancing team cohesion
 vs. team spacing, speed vs. cautious and careful observations, 
 and making sure that fire power is close to where the 
 suspected risks are.
 <BR>
 Developing such a patrol standard operating procedure (SOP) is
 both frustrating and fun. The patrol SOP requires a lot of code
 to get the complex interaction between the team members going, 
 and getting rid of bugs is hard. 
 <BR>
 Another case of frustration is throwing away a full day
 of work because a particular implementation just does not look
 'right' or is not effective enough (measured in casualties and kills).
 I once spent a full Sunday implementing the USMC SOP 
 for advancing fire teams. However, it just didn't prove as effective
 as the current one: tested in the movie scenario at Urban, the
 snipers won just about every engagement. That USMC SOP 
 implementation therefor became a victim as well :(
 <BR><BR>
 The fun, of course, starts when something nice starts to happen
 on the screen: a point man, halting just long enough (before turning
 the corner) to allow his wing man to catch up. A tail man, checking
 his back when you'd expect it. The team moving up sufficiently quick
 to prevent becoming obvious sniper targets.
 <BR>
 I'm about to experience that fun. I'll bring some screen shots
 next week.
 <BR><BR>
 Different topic: requests for beta testing. 
 Though I appreciate all the offers "to assist in
 beta testing", I cannot accept them. The current
 group of testers has no problem in pointing out
 any errors (and likely causes). 
 <BR>
 The only way I'm able to deliver an AQ2 bot as soon as possible
 is by continuing development. Spending more time on instructing
 new beta testers, and discussing their observations and tips
 will not help us at all.
 <BR><BR>
 Someone mailed me about the maps 'behind' the screen shots.
 The shots currently available from these pages (click 'm to see the 
 640x480 high-detail version for almost any image here) were all
 recorded on the Urban, City and Tokyo maps. Thanks to 
 Gerbil!, Ruskprick, and Scuzzy - you guys make the bots look good.
 <BR><BR>
 NB. The FAQ has been updated with the "why don't you release
 some DM bots to keep us busy while waiting" question (and answer).

 Welcome to the <B>CGF for ActionQ2</B> site. All the info on the upcoming ActionQ2 bots, 
 illustrated by lots of screen shots! 
 <BR>
 Alas, no bots to download yet, but I'm
 making steady progress (and have reduced my AQ2 on-line hours :( to spend more time
 with the bots).
 <BR>
 Expect to hear a release date in the first week of May.
 <BR><BR>
 I aim to update the site every week, to keep you posted on the progress. Meanwhile,
 have a look at the <A HREF="./cgfaq2.shtml">ideas</A> behind CGF and the 
 <A HREF="./design.shtml">planned features</A>.
 <BR><BR>
 This site wouldn't be here without the help of 
 <a href="http://www.telefragged.com">Telefragged</a> (the big mama for
 many of the ActionQ2 sites), the input and design of 
 <a href="mailto:cube@telefragged.com">Cube</a> 
 (site, logo and the action flick style image rotation in the sidebar), 
 and the many gamers who sent encouraging emails and offered support.
