 1. 'Subscript out of range. - Error 9' error?
 </a>
 </h5>
 <blockquote>
 Ross 'JoeSatch' Norton, author of the CGF Launcher says:
 <br>
 The real problem behind this cryptic message is that the Launcher is unable to find
 missions. In other words, the launcher hasn't been set up with the correct path to
 the CGF missions.
 <br>
 You correct this problem as follows:
 <OL>
    <LI>Run "Uninstall.exe" in the Launcher directory (this does not remove the
        Launcher, only the setup information)
    <LI>Run CGF Launcher again and re-enter the setup information, making sure
        everything is 100% correct and then proceed to load CGF Launcher.
 </OL>
 Note that the CGF missions typically are located in the 'action\missions' subdir of
 your Quake2 directory. You need to fill out the complete path.
 <br>
 We don't mind assisting you getting CGF to work provided you've made a decent
 effort to download and read the accompanying documentation.

 2. Why do I have to use a mission script, can't I just spawn bots?
 </a>
 </h5>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 The scripts define bot and team configurations, just like config
 files for other Q2 bots.
 <br><br>
 In addition, the scripts give hints about the map (key areas and
 locations) and define how bot teams are to behave (unlike other Q2
 bots).
 <br>
 I've worked hard to get the teams and bots smart enough to understand
 those terrain hints and team instructions without using too much
 CPU. As a result, these bots can be instructed to defend a building,
 patrol a map, or move and attack within a restricted area only.
 <br>
 The consequence of this implementation, though, is that the bots
 are no longer capable of acting without knowing their team, and
 instructions (as defined by the script).
 <br><br>
 However, most of the traditional team-based bot fights can be 
 set up using only a very small script.
 <br><br>
 </BLOCKQUOTE>

 <a name="qg2">
 3. Why don't you just release some DM bots?
 </a>
 </h5>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 CGF was designed from the start with team-oriented bots in mind.
 Concepts such as teams, formations, team procedures, point man, 
 suppression fire, team cohesion and team tactics have been taken
 into account from the first line of code.
 <BR><BR>
 These concepts don't come for free. Compared to 'ordinary' 
 DM bots, the AI has more work to do. To be able to run CGF on 
 'slower' PC's, I have put a lot of effort into optimizing the
 team AI. As a consequence, significant parts of the AI have
 moved from the bot AI to the fire team AI.
 <BR>
 For example: when a fire team detects an enemy, it is not
 the case that each member individually tries to determine the 
 best tactics for the team to perform. 
 <BR>
 Instead, solely the fire team AI determines, using
 information collected by all bots, what to do, and then issues
 strict orders to all fire team members.
 <BR>
 This approach not only correctly models well trained fire teams
 (that 'automatically' select the appropriate tactics), but also
 saves some CPU.
 <BR>
 The disadvantage of the approach is that the individual bot 
 without his/her team not that smart: instead, the bot just 
 executes the team's orders, fights, and forwards observations 
 to the team.
 <BR><BR>
 As you will understand by now, creating good solo DM bots 
 out of CGF is not simple at all.
 Neither is creating good TP bots out of a solo DM bot. 
 Trying to create good solo DM bots would delay CGF considerably.
 <BR><BR>
 I've chosen to develop team based AI back in '96, as I've found
 that lacking from most games. Developing team based AI still is a bigger
 creative challenge to me than creating yet another DM bot (no
 matter how much fun they might provide).
 <p>
 <I>
 Commercial break: since early September 99, there's a AQ2 DM (and some TP)
 bot available: LTK by RiEvEr. Get it via the <A HREF="./links.shtml">links</A> page.

 4. Will CGF be made available for Linux?
 </a>
 </h5>
 <blockquote>
 At some time after releasing CGF for Wintel platforms, I will
 make available Linux versions as well. It won't be soon after the
 first release, as I have grown accustomed to developing and
 debugging in the VisualC++ / VisualSourceSafe / VisualBasic
 environment.
 <p>
 CGF has been written without resorting to platform specific hacks 
 - porting to Linux basically will be dealing with differences between
 the MSVC++ STL and g++ STL (the ISO standard C++ template library). 
 "Normally", a few undiscovered bugs
 will rise their ugly head during that port as well.
 <p>
 As soon as I'll be ready to look at the Linux port, I'll issue a call
 for assistance; I probably need some advice in locating and 
 installing all drivers and libraries required to run Q2 on
 Linux. Until that call, please don't send me info over Linux.

 5. Will you port CGF to Action Half-Life?
 </a>
 </h5>
 <blockquote>
 Nope.
 <p>
 AHL isn't <i>the</i> realistic mod for Half-Life as AQ2 was for Quake2.
 It doesn't have the popularity (and thus the mapper's support) that
 AQ2 has.
 <br>
 Besides, AHL already has some kind of bots.
 <p>
 Finally, (and <i>the</i> reason that HL never had many bots developed
 for it), Valve's support for bot developers is not as good as they say 
 it is ('community support' has top priority on in PR talks but it took them over 
 seven months to release a few (minor) fixes that prevented any bot 
 running in the HL engine).

 I plan to develop a complete implementation of CGF for Action Quake2. 
 There's still a lot of work to do, and, typical for AI, AI is never
 finished. 
 <p>
 After that, I'll have a look at which game is interesting to develop
 team oriented bots for, and if I have sufficient time available to
 do a decent job at developing these bots.
 <p>
 Besides these mods, there are some other games on the horizon. The most challenging
 one (from a tactical bot perspective) definitely is (of course) Team Fortress 2.

 <h5>
 <a name="qg5">
 7. CGF seems to hang when launching it for a new route file!
 </a>
 </h5>
 <blockquote>
 To run CGF on a specific map, CGF requires three kinds of terrain files 
 (in directory action\terrain):
 <UL>
	<LI>{mapname}.srp, [essential!] containing the waypoints and connections between
	    the waypoints
	<LI>{mapname}.dst, (large!) containing the path lookup table for each pair of waypoints
	<LI>{mapname}.tac, containing all kinds of tactical lookup tables
 </UL>
 The path lookup table and tactical lookup tables are generated by CGF using as 
 input the Quake map, and the .srp file contents: waypoints and 
 connections.
 <p>
 Because generating these tables takes about 5 minutes, and because 
 most gamers don't like to wait that long before playing a mission, CGF
 computes these tables once, and stores them in (large) files. CGF
 then reads these files (thus: tables) at the start of a mission, and 
 launches the mission in about 10 seconds instead of 5 minutes. The
 sole disadvantage is that it takes a few MB's of your harddisk.
 <p>
 When you (or I) want to distribute the route (terrain) files for a
 specific map, the size of the .dst and .tac file becomes much more important.
 Modem users don't jump for joy when they need to download some
 MB's of data which they could compute themselves. 
 <p>
 For that reason, CGF route files are distributed using solely the essential
 .srp file.
 <p>
 As a result, the first time CGF tries to open the map for which you
 just installed the route file, CGF first has to compute the path lookup
 tables and tactical lookup tables. This takes about 5 minutes, in which
 CGF seems to hang (but instead works very hard). During that time, you'd
 better leave your PC (or at least CGF) alone.
 <p>
 After computing the tables, CGF tries to start the mission. Quake2, however,
 may have decided that you, as a gamer, have a bad connection, and show the
 'disconnect' phone jack symbol. If that is the case, just quit Quake2 and
 launch the mission again. The mission will start instantly.
 <p>
 </blockquote>
 <h5>
 <a name="qr1">
 8. Can I create route files for all kinds of maps??
 </a>
 </h5>
 <blockquote>
 With CGF 0.80, you're able to create route files yourself (see <A HREF="./doc_routes1.shtml">here</A> for more
 info on creating route files).
 <p>
 However, due to limitations of CGF and the complexity of a few AQ2 maps, it doesn't
 yet make sense to create route files for maps that feature:
 <UL>
	<LI>large amounts of natural, sloping terrain (such as cliff, cliff2, jungle1, teamjungle,
        but not armyterr); until the bot movement has been improved, the bots have troubles dealing
        with this terrain.
	<LI>button operated elevators/doors that are essential to gameplay, (as in blockwar,
        office3, chriscity); bots cannot yet handle button operated doors.
	<LI>serious swimming efforts (as in lighttower); bots cannot handle serious swimming yet.
    <LI>special 'effects' such as land mines (beachassault), artillery (desert), laser lines (theist),
        and trains (subway, riot2)
 </UL>
 It is my goal to have the bots handle natural terrain and button operated doors.
 </blockquote>
 <h5>
 <a name="qr2">
 7. Why can't the bots learn maps themselves?
 </a>
 </h5>
 <blockquote>
 One of the features that set CGF bots apart from most other bots is their
 tactical understanding of a map. The bots are able to pick reasonably good
 sniper locations, move up under cover or patrol stealthily. They also are
 able to predict threat positions if they lose contact with threats.
 <p>
 This tactical understanding is essential to the Action Q2 game (due the 
 single shot kill potential, emphasis on cover and stealth, and dark areas).
 <p>
 The implementation of this tactical understanding requires:
 <UL>
 	<LI>complete knowledge of the terrain;
 	<LI>so much CPU power that part of the computations need to be performed
	    before starting the game (the results of these computations are
		stored in the route files and take up to 6 minutes of CPU time on a
		Celeron300A) - as a result, the CPU load in-game is acceptable.
 </UL>
 Basically, this means that without a complete route files, the bots are
 not capable of Action quality combat. Due to the CPU demands, it is simply not 
 feasible to construct the required information bit by bit while discovering
 the map.
 <p>
 IMO, bots that can explore and learn to navigate a map themselves 
 (such as Eraser) are 'smart', but so are the CGF bots that understand the tactical
 significance of the terrain. At this time (of CPU power), we cannot have
 them both (ignoring the added complexity of deterimining tactical value of
 positions using incomplete information).
 <p>

 <a name="qv1">
 9. Will you add civilians / hostage / bystander bots??
 </a>
 </h5>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 The addition of civilians, hostages or bystanders bots has been suggested
 frequently. I also have spent considerable time thinking about how
 to add them. Technically, adding the AI for the civilians / hostages 
 themselves isn't that difficult (it fits in the current design).
 <p>
 The real issue is how to incorporate civilians, or bystanders
 in the game. Only when killing bystanders, and/or not killing any bystanders 
 means something to the game, I'm willing to add them. 
 Basically, that means I need to figure out a way to relate the health
 of bystanders to the mission objectives.
 <p>
 Hostages are still more demanding: missions would include hostages to allow
 players (or bots) to free them. In that case, new interactions would be
 required to enable the player to guide the hostages out.
 <p>
 However, the problem often overlooked is the consequences for the
 current bot AI: instead of just following orders, and engaging (with
 appropriate tactics) any player/bot from opposing forces, the AI
 would be required explicitly not damage bystanders.
 <br>
 This is more complex than it sounds: every line-of-fire is to be checked
 for a possible nearby bystander, grenades (not supported now) cannot
 be lobbed into any position anymore. Terrorist AI should understand
 the 'value' of bystanders, and may explicitly use them for cover.
 <br>
 In the case of hostages, escorting and protecting the hostages requires
 special AI as well...
 <p>
 Concluding this issue, I find the concept interesting (Rainbow Six and
 the HL mod Counter-Strike implement it, and it makes for a good game). However,
 it requires a good deal of work.<br>
 If and when I find the time to add it, I'll let you know.
 <p>

 does the realistic RB6 allow you to bandage any wounded hostages, before

 10. Will you add commands to call your team for assistance?
 </a>
 </h5>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 Some limited means to interact with friendly teams will be added, such
 as go-codes and calls for assistance.
 <p>
 Go-codes enable the player (or bots) to signal a friendly team to
 use a pre-defined (in the mission script) set of actions. Missions
 that provide go-codes to players should inform the player about
 the go-codes in the mission description. I prefer to standardize
 on go-codes "Red", "Yellow", and "Green" so players can use
 standard key binds.
 <p>
 A call for assistance will inform friendly teams about your problems;
 however, the bots are not guaranteed to help you - they might be
 facing hostiles themselves.
 <p>
 More detailed interaction won't be provided; the Quake2 environment
 just does not offer means to quickly state requests such as "take out
 the left pair of tango's on the sniper tower left of us". (Unreal
 Tournament is providing mouse menu's for that purpose, according to
 previews).

 11. Will CGF support Action mods such as Capture-the-briefcase or Gangsters?
 </a>
 </h5>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 Probably not. To support these mod mods, CGF would have to be ported
 to another code base. More importantly, the AI has not been designed to
 understand concepts such as flags (briefcases), flag capturing,
 flag carriers and flag defense. For AI, these concepts are non-trivial
 to deal with well in combination with the already complex Action rules.
 <p>
 Concepts as protect / assassinate the leader (as in Gangsters) are
 probably easier to support. In that case, I might add similar missions
 and team instructions to CGF.
 <br><br>
 </BLOCKQUOTE>
 <h5>
 <a name="qw1">
 12. How do I use the additional weapons for CGF in my missions
 </a>
 </h5>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 CGF includes support for <A HREF="./downloads.shtml#weapons">additional weapons</A>
 such as the Barrett sniper rifle, Ithaca shot gun and AK-47. The weapons themselves
 require <A HREF="./downloads.shtml#weapons">additional downloads</A>.
 <p>
 These weapons are explicitly used in a few CGF missions included in the CGF 0.82 
 download (notably for the RiotX map).
 <p>
 I would have preferred you using the CGF Launcher or CGF Mission Editor to
 easily add the weapons to your or the bots' load out for other missions as well.
 Alas, development of the CGF Launcher and CGF Mission Editor halted before
 the additional weapons were made available, and neither of these tools supports
 the new weapons.
 <p>
 This leaves you two more cumbersome ways to add the weapons to your missions:
 <UL>
	<LI>manually modify mission scripts and add weapons to the load-out of the
        player (and bots)
	<LI>run CGF with '+set cheats 1' and give yourself the weapons from the console
        (using some alias)
 </UL>
 <p>
 Modifying the mission scripts is done as follows (assuming you want to add the
 "Barrett M82 Sniper Rifle" to your load out):
 <OL>
	<LI>open the appropriate mission file
	<LI>locate the line defining the player load out, which looks something like:
        <p>
        <font size=1 face="Courier" color="#FFFFCC">
        player "dah player" "male/reservoir"
        </font>
        <p>
        you'll find the list of weapons and ammo issued to the player in the
        lines immediately below this line; this might look like:
        <p>
        <font size=1 face="Courier" color="#FFFFCC">
        {<br> 
        &nbsp;  ammo   "Machinegun Magazine" = 2;                    <br>
        &nbsp;  weapon "MP5/10 Submachinegun";<br>
        &nbsp;  <br> 
        &nbsp;  item   "Silencer";<br>
        &nbsp;  item   "Stealth Slippers";<br>
        };<br>
        </font>
        <p>
	<LI>between the curly brackets ('{' and '}') add a line for the Barrett rifle:
        <p>
        <font size=1 face="Courier" color="#FFFFCC">
        &nbsp;  weapon "Barrett M82 Sniper Rifle";<br>
        </font>
        <p>
	<LI>if ammo for this type of gun (sniper ammo) isn't listed yet, also add a
        line for this ammo between the curly brackets.
        <p>
        <font size=1 face="Courier" color="#FFFFCC">
        &nbsp;  ammo   "AP Sniper Ammo" = 10;<br>
        </font>
        <p>
        Together this results in the following player load out: 
        <p>
        <font size=1 face="Courier" color="#FFFFCC">
        player "dah player" "male/reservoir"<br>
        {<br> 
        &nbsp;  ammo   "Machinegun Magazine" = 2;                    <br>
        &nbsp;  weapon "MP5/10 Submachinegun";<br>
        &nbsp;  ammo   "AP Sniper Ammo" = 10;<br>
        &nbsp;  weapon "Barrett M82 Sniper Rifle";<br>
        &nbsp;  <br> 
        &nbsp;  item   "Silencer";<br>
        &nbsp;  item   "Stealth Slippers";<br>
        };<br>
        </font>
        <p>
	<LI>repeat this for all mission files listed in the objectives
        section of the mission script...
 </OL>
 Note that you can issue the optional weapons in a similar way to bots defined
 in the mission script (except for step 2. listed above; you should look for 'npc'
 instead of 'player').
 <p>
 <br>
 An alternative approach is to launch Action Quake 2 with cheats enabled
 (add the following to the command line):
    <br>
    <font size=1 face="Courier" color="#FFFFCC">
    &nbsp;  +set cheats 1
    </font>
 <p>
 Then, as soon as the mission starts, enter the following commands (using a
 configuration script, if you want to):
    <br>
    <font size=1 face="Courier" color="#FFFFCC">
    &nbsp;  give "Barrett M82 Sniper Rifle"
    &nbsp;  give "AP Sniper Ammo"
