 Quite a number of CGF related sites so take your pick really.

 </h5> 
 I'll post the latest list of CGF mission sites later (got to search through the mailbox to find all the links...). Some people have started to create their own routes for CGF. At the moment this is totally
 unsupported and so any problems or questions you have regarding routing or using unofficial route-files will go unanswered from now. CGF routing is rather more complicated than routing something like the Eraser bot (it is not just a case
 of running around laying nodes and defining locations) and so should you get any problems you're on your own. I have had a quick look at some of the routes out there and I can safely say they are no way near the quality William produces...

 Not sure how William was going to go about this so I'll do what I think is best. Anyway several CGF related sites have begun to spring up, and while I'm not going to add them to the links page I'll do a little rundown below just so you know they're out there:
 
 <ul>
 <li><a href=http://www.fortunecity.com/underworld/wipeout/731>CGF Bot Central</a> by Merc248
 <li><a href=http://welcome.to/cgf>CGF Mission Page</a> by Ned.
 <li><a href=http://surf.to/cgf_resource_site>CGF: Resource Site</a> by Maniac
 </ul>
 
 I'll post an updated list once a week until William returns (then I'm sure he'll organise something proper regarding CGF sites).

 Ok <a href=mailto:rossnorton@mweb.co.za>JoeSatch</a> has sent me a fix for the launcher for those who have been having trouble getting it to run. It should fix the error that causes <i>runtime error 429, activeX component cant create object</i> to be displayed when running the program. 
 <p>
 You'll need the runtime files from yesterday (linked below and on the downloads page) and you'll then need to download <a href=http://tux.telefragged.com/file.pl?filename=LaunchFix.zip&dir=telefragged/be/>LaunchFix.zip</a> (214Kb).
 Make sure you read the 'README!.txt' file included before installing the fix.
 <h5>
 July 18, 1999
 </h5>
 <a href=mailto:cube@botepidemic.com>Cube</a> here, taking charge while William is off holidaying. Anyway <a href=mailto:rossnorton@mweb.co.za>Ross 'JoeSatch' Norton</a> has released the first version of the CGF launcher, enabling you to
 set mission parameters and the like before launching the game.
 <br><br>
 There are two files available, both which are self-extracting. The first one is launcher itself which you will need to extract to your Quake II directory (it has set paths so the launcher files should go into the right directories from there).
 Then there are a collection of runtime files required for the launcher, which are:
 
 <ul>
 <li>msvbvm50.dll
 <li>msvcrt.dll
 <li>msvcrt20.dll
 <li>msvcrt40.dll
 </ul>
 
 If you don't have these then you also need this package, which can either be put into the launcher directory or into your windows/system directory. Placing them in the launcher directory is adviseable though.
 
 <p>
 The two file packages are available below:
 
 <ul>
 <li><a href=http://tux.telefragged.com/file.pl?filename=Launch100.exe&dir=telefragged/be/>CGF Launcher</a> (Launch100.exe) [772Kb]
 <li><a href=http://tux.telefragged.com/file.pl?filename=runtimes.exe&dir=telefragged/be/>Assorted Runtime files</a> (Runtimes.exe) [1.13Mb]
 </ul>
 
 Finally make sure you read the 'readme.htm' that is included with the files for the Launcher before mailing <a href=mailto:rossnorton@mweb.co.za>Ross</a> with problems.

 As mentioned in the previous update, I just don't have much time
 for CGF this month. Because of that, the new beta 0.78 contains few 
 modifications, but essential modifications for the new map supported: Ruskprick's city.
 However, most reported bugs haven't been fixed<a href="#fn1"><SUP>1</SUP></a>.
 <p>
 Two small sets of missions are supplied as well: one, in which you 
 (as a 'counter'sniper) assist a four men attack force to clear City's
 rooftops. Another, in which you just need to survive on City's streets.
 <p>
 You can count on the various mission sites (see the <A HREF="./links.shtml">links</A> page) to
 offer new missions for City in about two days.
 <p>
 In case you're in doubt whether or not to download 2.3MB (or the smaller
 upgrade), here's Oswald's <A HREF="./review2.shtml">review.</A>
 <p>
 I wish you all a lot of fun with the upcoming Action Half Life (late
 July).
 <BR><BR>
 <A HREF="mailto:william@botepidemic.com">William</A>
 <p>
 <FONT SIZE=1>
 <a name="fn1"><SUP>1</SUP></a>: normally I don't make more changes than I can test. Most
 bug fixes just had to be postponed because I lack the time to test them:
 whereas AQ2 source code is about 38,000 (38K) lines of code (LOC), CGF for
 AQ2 adds 58KLOC, thus totalling 96KLOC. Every planned change should be made 
 in such a way that it is consistent with all assumptions made in the existing 
 (lines) of code. For example, 'just' reducing the vision qualities of the bot (something
 that needs to be done) affects lots of other behavior (aiming, patrol behavior, etc.), 
 and affects just too much to test right now.

 I'm really happy to see CGF being received well. The beta has been
 downloaded in larger numbers than I could have imagined. More than
 anything else, that should be contributed to the big Action Quake2 
 community, large, alive and kicking because of people like the A-Team, 
 Fireblade & Zucchini, the talented mappers, modellers and skinners, and
 all those server ops and action gamers.
 <p>
 I also have received tons of useful bug reports and good feedback on
 the AI. Thanks. I know what to do (an I'll try to hand over as much as
 possible the non 'bot' work to speed things up).
 <p>
 I was very surprised about the number of people that were already able
 to craft missions themselves, without having good documentation available.
 A couple of the first user made missions are now available from <A HREF="./downloads.shtml">this</A> site,
 and more missions are available from other new CGF Mission sites as well
 (you'll find them on the <A HREF="./links.shtml">links</A> page).

 Before the release, I wasn't sure how to distribute mission files.
 Meanwhile that has been decided for me, by the rapid arrival of a
 few mission sites. I am both glad to receive their help, but a
 bit worried about not being able to check missions before they
 are distributed: badly written missions cause CGF to crash, and/or
 the bots to act unnecessarily stupid. That really spoils the fun.
 (Of course, CGF also crashes for less valid reasons, since it's 
 still a beta). 
 <p>
 Therefor, I'm asking the mission site webmasters to check all
 missions before releasing them, for the following properties:
 <UL>
 <LI>.zip file directory structure (the AQ2 convention of 
     'action' as the root dir)
 <LI>stable execution (some script constructs are more likely
     to crash CGF than others); stability can be tested easily.
	 Even if the CGF engine is to blame, it's still not a valid
	 reason to release a script that's very likely to crash.
 <LI>sufficient information in the mission description; a
     gamer should be able to understand his mission from that
	 text
 <LI>a sufficient number of variants (by having at least the
     opposing forces start from different locations or with
	 different instructions); this keeps the player on his
	 toes
 <LI>do not depend on skins and models that are not part of
     the AQ2 model packs (from the 
	 <A HREF="http://guild.action-web.net">Actor's Guild</A>)
 </UL>
 In addition, it would be nice if the (set of) scripts were
 reviewed and described on the web site. It's probably not
 required to discuss the missions with the style and accuracy
 of <A HREF="http://6thfloor.actionquake.com">[NT]Oswald's map reviews</A>, but it wouldn't hurt either...
 <p>
 I'll maintain links to solely those CGF Mission sites that
 perform the required 'quality assurance'.
 <p>
 This month, I won't have much time to work on CGF. (From August onwards,
 I'll be working the 'normal hours' again). You can expect another
 route file this week, with a sample mission. There's plenty of talent
 in our community to craft that into hot action fights.
 <p>
 Be careful. Wear your kevlar :)

 To explain how CGF and the bots are different from 'standard bots as we've known them',
 I have recorded an illustrated description of a 'be a hitman: eliminate gangster boss Sabotage' single
 player CGF mission (included in the download). 
 <br>
 Gamers that already played
 these missions will have similar but different experiences; even if the chances are
 against you, most fights remain unpredictable due to CGF's way of scripting.
 <p>
 It's your task to eliminate Sabotage, some criminal leader. Sabotage is hiding
 in one of the map's rooms, and is protected by
 some snipers and patrolling teams. You receive assistance from some fellow bots who
 will engage Sabotage's patrols. You accomplish this mission only by eliminating
 Sabotage; if you don't meet the time limit, or both your buddies and you die, the mission
 is a failure.

 A few (important) remarks with respect to installing the beta:
 <ul>
 <li> unzip the .zip to your <FONT face="Courier">quake2\<FONT COLOR="#FF1010">action</FONT></FONT> subdirectory
      (just like the release notes tell you!), 
      not your <FONT face="Courier">quake2</font> directory 
	  <br>
      (incorrectly unzipping to your quake2 directory overwrites your standard Quake2
	   gamex86.dll; in that case, you need to reinstall the latest Q2 3.20 upgrade
	   again)
 <li> a few people experience problems in launching the bots via the batch files. A couple of work arounds:
      <ul>
	  <li>verify if you have an autoexec.cfg file in your action directory. if that file includes lines such as
	      <br>
          <FONT face="Courier">set teamplay 0</font>
		  <br>
		  or
          <FONT face="Courier">set dmflags somevalue</font>
		  <br>
		  please remove these lines from your autoexec.cfg and try again
	  <br>
	  <li>launch them by hand (as follows)
	  <br>
	  1. start action quake2 (the normal way)
	  <br>
	  2. start network server (from the menu, choose multiplayer)
	  <br>
	  3. increase the number of players to 16 or more
	  <br>
	  4. change the deathmatch flags, and make sure that teamplay is enabled (by skin or by model)
	  <br>
	  5. launch the network server
	  <br>
	  6. now you're just on your own in a normal teamplay game, so...
	  <br>
	  7. on the console, type 'exec cgf_urban_hitman_1.cgf' or 'exec cgf_urban_streets_1.cgf'
	  <br>
	  8. enjoy!
	  </ul>
 </ul>
 By now, most mirror sites will have the beta as well.
 <p>
 We are trying to sort out problems with Ross "JoeSatchs" Norton's bot launcher and 
 redistributable .dll files; after that, we'll make the launcher available (probably
 somewhere next week).
 <br>
 The launcher should assist you in starting the mission without batch files, 
 with your favourite weapon, and with bots at the specified skill.

 CGF 0.77 beta has arrived. It's still a long way to accomplish what I've set
 out to do, but we're getting somewhere.
 <p>
 You can fetch the beta <A HREF="http://tux.telefragged.com/file.pl?filename=cgf_0_77.zip&dir=telefragged/be/">here, at 1.2MB (Windows only).</A> 
 <p>
 Please spend your time (while waiting for the beta to be downloaded) by
 reading these <A HREF="./downloads/cgf_0_77.txt">release notes</A> carefully.
 <p>
 When you have questions, please consult the <a href="https://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/aqdt.fear.net/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro">AQ2 message board </A>first (and
 read the relevant postings before submitting the questions). I'll give
 priority to answering questions there (over replying my email).

 The counting down has started (release on July 8 - see below). To keep you busy, the <A HREF="./missions.shtml">missions</A> page now
 lists a sample (advanced) mission file.

 Instead of providing a beta on July 7 (as I announced in the previous
 updage), I'd like to take yet another day off from work (July 8) and 
 put a little extra effort and testing into the beta (making it less a beta). 
 Later that day (thus <I>July 8</I>), I'll load it up.
 <p> 
 <TABLE background="./graphics/film.gif"  border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 height=150 width=468 >

 It will be a beta (0.77) nevertheless, and limited to a single map (Gerbil!'s 
 Urban). (A route file and new missions for a second map will be 
 provided next week). I hope to receive some useful feedback based on
 that beta.
 <br>
 Being about 1MByte in size (zipped), the download will keep you busy
 for a couple of hours. The missions will include "shoot everything
 that moves" missios, weapon training missions, and some more
 advanced ones (but all occurring at Urban).
 <br>
 You'll be able to adjust skill settings for the bots, and the armament
 for the bots by editing the mission file. (It is my goal to allow you
 to create missions from scratch and route files for any map you choose,
 but not at this time when there's plenty to debug and change).
 <p>
 Aside from the map limitation, the release is definitely a beta because
 the bots still lack:
 <UL>
 <LI>a smarter way of moving (including strafing)
 <LI>close combat AI (moving during firing, as is the way to handle the
     shotgun, cannon and knifes)
 </UL>
 In addition, CGF (it's more than bots, remember) could use mission 
 intro's and outro's, informing the player in a better way about the 
 mission and the mission results. And the bot launcher won't be included
 immediately (we're having some troubles getting the mission parser
 component to install on other machines).
 <br>
 A hard to catch bug will also be present: in some cases, Q2 crashes when
 using the M3/Super90 shotgun in software rendering mode. The work-around
 for this problem is using the "hand 2" setting (so you don't see your
 own weapon in your hands), or using your hardware accellerated graphics
 board :). My debugger won't catch this bug, and I currently don't have clue where,
 when and why this bug occurs.
 <p>
 (If you make it to here, you more or less have read the full release notes
  before launching the bots. That's the way to do it :)).
 <p>
 Aside from all these limitations, CGF will be Action! (There's that huge
 list of <A HREF="./design.shtml">features</A> that is included in the beta).

<FONT SIZE="1" > p.s. Many thanks to Cube for locating the source for the mysterious 'Internet
 Explorer 5' crashes caused by this site (it didn't crash my IE5 though). The
 culprit seems to be the use of JScript/ECMAScript definitions within a table
 (the CGI script for the Telefragged banner generates JScript).
 <br> 
 As you can see, the banner has been moved from the table to the top of the page.
 Cube converted all pages to this new format, and put the .png picture format
 back in place (smaller files, better pictures, but some Netscape users need to
 fetch a plug-in from the link below).
