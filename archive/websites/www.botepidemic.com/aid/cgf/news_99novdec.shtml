 Ho ho ho ho. Santa Claus brings us CGF 0.81 with bug-fixes, CGF multi-player test-code and support for
 RiotX.

 </TABLE>

 <p>
 The bugs that have been fixed include:
 <UL>
	<LI>appearance of blue/green balls and male/reservoir models ('men in black')
	<LI>fixed echo-ing of 'enemyd' and 'enemys' sounds when issued by player
    <LI>fixed picking up of 'old school' cannon (weapon wasn't selected after picking up)
    <LI>fixed VWEP representation when bot switches weapon
    <LI>terrain computations are post-poned until mission start, so a warning now can
        appear on-screen
    <LI>close-combat bot behavior has been made more aggressive
    <LI>movement tweaks to deal with low portals preceded by &lt;8 unit thresholds (urban2 and all windows at riotx)
    <LI>player name substitutions now work; mission objectives can refer to the mission
        name of the player whereas the player keeps his name
 </UL>
 In addition, CGF 0.81 contains test code for multi-player CGF. Since I solely have
 a single PC at my disposal, thoroughly testing multi-player code is tough for me
 (see image above). In
 other words, I'm solliciting feedback from you.
 <br>
 You can find the info on how to run CGF in multi-player mode <A HREF="./design_multiplayer.shtml">here</A>.

 <p>
 To add an X-mass touch to this release, and more importantly, to enable CGF to visit
 one of the best AQ2 maps ever, RiotX "Jingle Balls Special" by Ellusion is now supported.
 RiotX may initially look like a snow covered Riot: Gangbang conversion, but you'll soon discover
 that this map extends Riot with an impressive amount of (demanding) jumps and new routes,
 a gloomy atmosphere, and a musical touch. Get it <A HREF="http://aqmd.action-web.net/cgi-bin/download.pl?File=riotx.zip">here.</A>
 <p>
 The two series of RiotX missions have been designed with CGF (co-op) multi-player in mind
 (they also work fine as single-player missions, but may be a bit challenging).
 <p>
 My plans for CGF now include:
 <UL>
	<LI>improving bot movement so the bots can deal with natural terrain as in the jungle and cliff maps
    <LI>tackle button operated doors
    <LI>retro-fitting a number of AQ2 1.52 features
	<LI>experiments with 'func_train' vehicles (not sure if this results in something useful)
 </UL>
 <p>
 Enjoy your holidays!

 A quote from an email I received explains this best:
 <BLOCKQUOTE><I>
 [CGF] is just plain fun to play it, I played the [p1_lightbeam] map mission 
 for about 136 missions. Because I knew all the bot positions, 
 I was bored.
 <br>
 Then I saw the AI training button on the corner, I clicked it and when I 
 played, to my surprise THEY WERE ACTUALLY KILLING ME!
 <br>
 I went up, as I usually did to the ceiling, but the two bastards I 
 killed weren't there. The first one was in the water waiting to kill me, 
 and before I knew it he did.
 <br>
 Then after another try I got rid of him and when I went up the 
 second one on the ceiling wasn't there, and to my surprise the bot was 
 in that little vent waiting for someone to come look for him and 
 got me right in the head! 
 </I></BLOCKQUOTE>
 <p>
 With CGF 0.80, a 'AI Training' button (see image above) in the CGF Launcher is unlocked. Via
 this button, you can have CGF update its tactical understanding of the map.
 <br>
 The CGF bots will take into account their combat experience (this location is a killzone,
 that location was used for camping, etc.) and re-evaluate all positions.
 Positions that, for example, overlook kill zones will now be ranked higher.
 With their new understanding of the map's strong and weak positions, 
 the bots will adapt some of their tactics.
 <p>
 Don't expect every 'AI training' to always have as big an impact as described above.
 It's a novel feature, to CGF (and to the tactical shooters in general :) ).
 We'll have to experiment a bit to get it really good; I'd like to see your feedback.
 <p>
 <B><A NAME="3dfxfog">Fog on 3dfx voodoo</a></B>
 <br>
 The trick provided in the previous news update doesn't seem to work, but I received
 a good number of emails with a trick that apparently works:
 <OL>
	<LI>get the opengl32.dll intended for glquake (Quake1);
        <br>it's 
        <A HREF="http://www.fileplanet.com/index.asp?section=105&file=9836">here</A> at FilePlanet.

    <LI>launch Quake2, in the video menu, set the mode to 'default opengl'
    <LI>make sure you've set fog to 1 (see <A HREF="./exp_fog.shtml">here</A>)

 <B><A NAME="bugs">"Men In Black" bug</a></B>
 <br>
 CGF 0.80 sometimes presents you with a silent non-solid row of 'men in black', surrounded
 by green and blue balls [see image above]. It's a leftover from a session to debug formation
 placement, and I forgot to remove it.
 <br>
 It looks like a pretty innocent bug; however, these 'men in black' and more particular
 the balls consume a lot of entities; I suspect this bug to cause some crashes in the 'coverme'
 missions. The bug will be fixed in the next release (see below).
 <p>
 Another small bug: The old-style cannon incorrectly consumes ammo of the last used weapon.
 <p>
 <B><A NAME="multiplayer">CGF co-op multiplayer</a></B>
 <br>
 In addition to answering lots of emails and fixing the above mentioned bugs, I started
 working on co-op multiplayer. This should enable LAN-users to co-operatively play against
 the bots. Don't expect CGF to become as stable a multi-player internet game as AQ2 1.52 (which
 requires little attention from the server operator); CGF is way too complex to contain
 so few bugs.
 <br>
 However, co-op multiplayer CGF will do fine as a supervised 'listen' or 'dedicated' server
 on a LAN.
 <p>
 In about two weeks, I intend to release CGF 0.81, fixing the above mentioned bugs, and containing
 test code for multi-player CGF (I do have some troubles testing multi-player thoroughly on just
 a single PC).
 <p>

 <h5>
 December 1, 1999
 </h5>
 The new CGF 0.80 version seems to be about as solid as I intended it to be. It 
 breezes a bit of new live into the existing missions (the AI fights different from
 the previous releases, and hiding in the dark can be quite effective). The new
 missions are well received.
 <p>
 Most questions deal with the availability of a few maps (see below), 'Quake2 not responding
 when launching CGF for the first time' (allow it a few minutes, see <A HREF="./faq.shtml#qg5">here</A>),
 and fog for the 3dfx graphics accellerators.

 The maps 'riot' and 'coverme' are not as easy to find as the others (though clicking
 on the <A HREF="./downloads.shtml#terrain">images</A> at the downloads page would 
 have sent you straight to the right web site). Just to be sure, here they are again:
 <UL>
	<LI><a href="http://asp.planetquake.com/dl/dl.asp?lotus/riot.zip">Riot: Gangbang</a> (by Ellusion), 1.4MB
	<LI><a href="http://tux.telefragged.com/file.pl?filename=coverme.zip&dir=telefragged/aqmd/testmaps/">Cover Me</a> (by Sir Francis), 1.5MB
 </UL>
 With respect to seeing fog on a 3dfx card: I'm unable to test that myself (TNT here).
 I know for sure fog doesn't work on the older 3dfx drivers (appearing as '3dfx opengl' in
 the Quake2 menu), but 3dfx recently released new reference drivers implementing the full 
 OpenGL 1.1 (or so they say). 
 <br>
 [incorrect advice on getting fog to work on 3dfx boards removed]
 <p>
 Finally: the <A HREF="./downloads.shtml#weapons">new weapons</A>. Yes, 11MB isn't a very small download, but the weapons have
 been split over three archives of less than 6MB each. And, as can be seen in the screen
 shots above, they look (and sound) great.

 I personally am fond of the new missions:
 <UL>
	<LI>assaulting a well defended building at Riot (see left image above)
	<LI>defending the L-Mart at Coverme (where about 5 windows get broken in
        the first 30 seconds)
    <LI>infiltrating and clearing the p1_lightbeam lighthouse complex
 </UL>
 The new supply of weapons (and weapon sounds) adds to the chaos of squad-on-squad
 engagements.
 <p>
 You can read all about the CGF 0.80 features both <A HREF="./features.shtml">here</A>

 Please read the download and release instructions carefully. And beware of the
 <A HREF="http://www.botepidemic.com/aid/cgf/faq.shtml#qg5">5 minute number crunching</A> preceding the first missions on a new map (CGF seems to

 From the upcoming CGF version 0.80 onwards, the CGF bots won't ever be the same again!
 Just like the better tactical gamers, these bots, with every fight, will get a better feel 
 for the map's high traffic areas, the kill zones, the camp spots, the bottlenecks, and the 
 successful sniper locations. They will build up combat experience...
 <br>
 And, more importantly, they will use that experience to improve and adapt their tactics.

 CGF 0.80 will monitor the actions that humans and bots perform. 
 For each map, during every mission, CGF collects data. And slowly but surely, patterns 
 will emerge, allowing the bots, for example, to:
 <UL>
	<LI>keep a better eye on high traffic areas when sniping
	<LI>avoid known kill-zones when patrolling
 </UL>
 This experience can also be integrated into the 
 <A HREF="design_terrain_ranking.shtml">CGF static terrain analysis</A>. CGF performs this analysis
 for new maps to a get good first impression of the tactical value of map locations. The experience gained
 by the bots will provide valuable information to adjust and improve this impression.
 <br>
 The <A HREF="./downloads.shtml#launcher">CGF Launcher</A> (by 
 <A HREF="mailto:mailto:rossnorton@mweb.co.za">Ross 'JoeSatch' Norton</A>) will inform you when it's time to do so 
 (when confronted with CGF 0.80 terrain files, the CGF Launcher will unlock the 'Learn' feature).

 The center graph above shows the kill zones among the roof level locations at Urban (blue areas
 are unaccessible at that height). In
 their fights the bots experienced the largest numbers of kills and damage at the ladder to the 
 high roof (top right), the small planks leading towards the high
 roof (center right), next to the Coke sign (bottom center), as well as in the open street
 area near the AQ2 sign (top left).
 <br>
 The graph to the right shows 'early contact bottlenecks' at street and lower roof level. 
 The red and orange locations typically host bots during the initial contact. The bots learned
 the bottlenecks near corners of the buildings (left side), the sniper room (center bottom),
 and the ladder to the lower rooftop (right).

 <p>
 This 'tactical learning' is pretty unique (few tactical shooters, if any, analyze traffic and 
 terrain to provide you with adaptive tactics), but experimental as well (for the same reason). 
 I guarantee that the bots adapt their tactics based on your and their performance (they
 react a bit stronger to your performance than to theirs since you're still the smartest fighter), but
 I cannot guarantee that the bots will counter all your tricks, or rank up more kills. But you might
 be training your own killers...

 Note that experience files created by CGF cannot be 'reverse engineered'
 to extract particular tactics performed by a particular player: the player activity
 is stored anonymously and mixed with bot activities. Your privacy is guaranteed :)
 <p>
 And for the AI fans: adding a learning ability isn't a magic solution. A learning mechanism is
 solely capable of grasping an idea if programmer already has a good hunch for that idea,
 and provides it with the correct inputs and an evaluation function (not that easy in a CGF mission context).
 <br>
 Even then, it can solely 
 provide limited improvements. Do not expect a 'learning AI' to come up with some
 cool looking bounding overwatch advance (unless it is capable of watching the 'The Rock'
 (the movie) a couple of times, write code for a week, and do performance tuning as well -
 that's the way I did it). (See the <A HREF="http://www.botepidemic.com/neuralbot">NeuralBot</A> for more 
 info on what a "100% learning bot" can do).

 The upcoming release is coming along nicely. There's still a bit of tuning and testing to be
 done. I need to work on the new route files, documentation and this web site as well. But 
 in about a week, you'll get to experience it!
 <br>
 By now, the 120KB animation at the <A HREF="#adaptivetactics">top</A> of this page should have loaded, and show you a glimpse
 of the improved spread out during engagements.

 <br>
 The <A HREF="http://tq2.teamhavoc.net/">Terror Quake2</A> team are pretty hesitant in allowing me to distribute a subset of their
 weapons with CGF. I understand that - the weapons are their creations, and I'm not giving much
 of CGF away either.
 <br>
 Instead, I'll prepare CGF to work with a few of their weapons, and include instructions of how to install a 
 few TQ2 weapons with CGF. The sole problem, however, is that TQ2 isn't available in smaller lumps
 than a 30MB full install. I've offered TQ2 to provide them with the exact 3.5MB zip file required
 for CGF, but have yet to receive an answer. It might help if you also make a polite request (they
 have a forum at their <A HREF="http://tq2.teamhavoc.net/">site</A>).
 <br>
 Meanwhile, MP*Canus and Lennon have been very helpful in creating VWEP animations, enabling the Q2 male to hold an AK47 as well.

 p.s. RiEvEr, at his <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/maxtron/ltk/">LTK</a> site (the other bot for AQ2) incorrectly credits me for writing fog code: I didn't
 write any really new fog code, but instead figured out how to load specific fog settings for each
 map, and how much concealment the different types of fog provide (for use in the AI). See the <A HREF="./exp_fog.shtml">fog info</A> for the real credits.
