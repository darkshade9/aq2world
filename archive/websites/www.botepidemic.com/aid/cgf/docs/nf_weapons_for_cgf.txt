-----------------------------------------------------------------

About:   This archive contains six Navy Fortress weapons converted for
         use in CGF for AQ2 (v0.80 and later).
         The weapons are the AK97, MAC-10 and H&K UMP-45 submachine guns,
         the Dragunov sniper rifle, the Ithaca Model37 shotgun, and
         the Beretta 92F pistol.
         The archive includes view models, ground models,
         VWEPs and sounds.
         This archive was composed with permission of the Navy Fortress
         team.

         Due to the conversion to CGF (animation frames and 
         skin path names in the tris.md2 / w_*.md2), the weapons nor 
         the VWEPs can be used for NF; you have to download normal 
         NF archives to play NF.

         Due to the way AQ2 is organized, you cannot access the
         weapons in normal Action Quake2. Instead, get CGF and use
         these weapons against the bots.

         Please don't bother the NF team if you have troubles with
         this archive. Visit the CGF site instead.

Usage:   Unzip this file into your Action Q2 directory, with 'use
         path names' enabled. Files will be created in the following 
         directories:
         - action/models/nf_weapons_for_cgf.txt          (this file)
         - action/models/weapons/fortress/*         (weapons, skins)
         - action/players/male/w_*.md2             (all six weapons)
         - action/players/terror/w_*.md2           (all six weapons)
         - action/players/sas/w_*.md2              (all six weapons)
         - action/players/messiah/w_*.md2          (all six weapons)
         - action/players/aqmarine/w_*.md2         (all six weapons)
         - action/players/actionmale/w_*.md2       (all six weapons)
         - action/players/sydney/w_*.md2                 (ak97 only)
         - action/players/female/w_*.md2                 (ak97 only)

         - action/sound/weapons/fortress/*                  (sounds)

         Then, pick or edit a CGF mission so that it features the
         correct weapon names (see CGF documentation).
