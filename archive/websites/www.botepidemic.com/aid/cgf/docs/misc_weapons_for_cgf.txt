    for use in CGF for AQ2 (http://www.botepidemic.com/aid/cgf)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

About:   This archive contains two additional optional guns for
         use in CGF for AQ2 (v0.80 and later).
         The weapons are old-style hand cannon (looks like an
         impressive piece of B.A. Baraccus style last-minute
         welding), and Odd-Job's tommy gun.
         The archive includes view models, ground models,
         and VWEPs.
         In addition, four male skins, inherited from the late
         Navy SEALs II team, were added (creator unknown).

         Due to the way AQ2 is organized, you cannot access the
         weapons in normal Action Quake2. Instead, get CGF and use
         these weapons against the bots.

         Please don't bother the AQ2 team if you have troubles with
         this archive. Visit the CGF site instead.

Usage:   Unzip this file into your Action Q2 directory, with 'use
         path names' enabled. Files will be created in the following 
         directories:
         - action/models/misc_weapons_for_cgf.txt        (this file)
         - action/models/?_tommygun/*                     (tommygun)
         - action/models/?_oldcannon/*            (old-style cannon)
         - tommygun vwep (w_tommygun.md2) 
           in players/male, /terror, /sas, /messiah, /aqmarine,
                     /sydney, oddjob/ 

         Then, pick or edit a CGF mission so that it features the
         correct weapon names (see CGF documentation).
