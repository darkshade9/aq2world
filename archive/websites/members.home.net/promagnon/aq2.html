<H2>Whats new in this version (1.09)</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Lots of bug fixes
<LI>Crushers and doors work again FOR SURE!
<LI>Gunners give ya better stuff
<LI>Overflowing on level fact2 fixed FOR SURE! ( Doh!  I found out why, there were 2 reasons. )
</UL>
<H2>What is this?</H2>
<P>This is a modification for Action Quake 2.  Action Quake 2 brings real-life weaponary to the Quake 2
environment.  This modification allows you to use those changes to fight against the stroggs, along with some
other chages as well (nothing too drastic or gameplay-altering).</P>
<H2>What does it contain?</H2>
<P>The current version has the following features, over and above the features already present in AQ2 (Action Quake 2):</P>
<UL>
<LI>Single player mode, with enemies having AQ2 style weaponary, including the much feared sniper rifle.
<LI>A new teamplay scoring method, giving points for damage caused and subtracting points for damage received.
<LI>Distance-Modified shotgun blasts so that at very long and medium long ranges the shot gun's blast doesn't do
as much damage as it would at point blank.
<LI>The ability to ignore someone.  Type <I>/ignore [name]</I> to ignore them and nothing they say will grace your
ears again until you say <I>/ignore nobody</I>.  They are made aware that you are ignoring them in order to 
avoid wasted conversation.  If they change names it will still ignore them.  You can also type <I>/ignore</I> 
alone, to get the current person you are ignoring's name, if any.
<LI>Deathmatch remains the same, so server ops can use this patch without worrying.
<LI>Better effects for head shots.
<LI>A hellavalot more, including co-op mode...
