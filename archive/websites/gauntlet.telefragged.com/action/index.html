<h1>MBCTB News</h1>
<p>March 26<BR>The 0.50 version has been released!  Look for the new DLL near the bottom.  It's
a server only upgrade, so client v.04 will still work.</p>

<h1>[6e9]rrRYAN's 5-second MBCTB FAQ </h1>
<p>Ok, here's a quick little FAQ I whipped up for Mr. Brian's Capture the Briefcase 
  (MBCTB). This isn't by any means official, or necessarily 100% accurate, it's 
  just something I wrote so I send people to it instead of explaining the whole 
  thing while juggling an MP5 and a briefcase.</p>
<h2>1. What are those big white &quot;diapers&quot; on people? What are all the 
  picture not found errors I'm getting?</h2>
<p>You need the pak file for MBCTB. It's not a doozy by any means (22k, I believe), 
  and is available <a href="http://www.furnation.com/brian/action/aq2-ctb-client.04.zip">here</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Ok, I'm not getting spammed by error messages any more, now what?</h2>
<p>Well, not you need to pick a team and inventory just like in normal AQ, then 
  hit fire and you'll be instantly dropped into the game. Before I explain the 
  object, let me touch on some key differeces between MBCTB and normal AQ. The 
  biggest one (other than the obvious briefcases, which I'll get to), is that 
  MBCTB is no longer &quot;die and stay dead&quot;. After you die, you must sit 
  around for a certain amount of time (a server variable, defaults to 20 seconds). 
  Hit fire when the timer above your life hits zero, and *poof* you're back in 
  the game. Remember to hit fire (there's been several times where I've sat chatting 
  well beyond the timer expiration..)</p>
<p>So, now, run around and kill people just like in AQ.</p>
<h2>3. Ok, I've killed tons of people, but that's getting old. Wasn't there something 
  about briefcases?</h2>
<p>Oh, so you wanna actually play the game how it's meant to be played, huh? Ok. 
  Well, at the start of every round, you'll notice a briefcase sitting at your 
  spawn point. When God or the director or however it is who says &quot;Action!&quot; 
  says &quot;Action!&quot;, one of your teammates should pick that puppy up and 
  get it to a safe place. Why, you ask? Well, the goal of MBCTB is for one PERSON 
  (not one team) to hold both briefcases. When that happens, his team wins. So, 
  you COULD run out blazing with the case, but chances are you'll get gunned down, 
  so it's always smarter to let someone not holding the case take the risks. But, 
  since this is a FAQ and not a tutorial, I won't get much into strategy here.</p>
<h2>4. Hey! This dead persons talking to me!! What's up with that?!?</h2>
<p>Spooky, huh? Well, unlike normal AQ, dead people CAN communicate with the living.</p>
<h2>5. What? Is that a bug?</h2>
<p>No. Basically, dead people are meant to act as scouts and commanders for the 
  live ones. So don't waste your dead time plotting how you're gonna get back 
  at that guy for handcannon-ing you from behind, spend it looking for the other 
  team's flag and telling your teammates whats in store for them. Without good 
  communication between the living and the dead, it's neary impossible to find 
  the other team's briefcase on some maps.</p>
<h2>6. Who made this crazy thing?</h2>
<p>Well, I'm no genius, but judging from the title, I'd say <a href="mailto:brianyee@hotmail.com">Mr. 
  Brian</a> did. If you see any bugs (keeping in mind Question #5), send 'em to 
  him, not me. (All I did was write this little FAQ). This is a totally different 
  AQ mod than the CTB currently in development by the Action Quake Development 
  Team (AQDT). Neither mod is an &quot;official&quot; mod endorsed by Team Action.</p>
<h2>7. So, where do I play this crazy game?</h2>
<p>Good question. The easiest way to find MBCTB servers is to use <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/">GameSpy</a>. 
  If you've enver used GameSpy, please consult their page for more information. 
  <a href="aq2_mbctb.qst">Here</a> is a MBCTB tab for GameSpy. If you want to 
  make your own tab, MBCTB servers have the server variable &quot;ctb&quot; set 
  to 1.<BR><BR>Or view a server list <A href="ctbservers.html">here</A></p>
<h2>8. Help! The briefcase is stuck in the elevator shaft!</h2>
<p>Well, now who'd fault is that? Unfortuneately, there's no way to get that case 
  back until the end of the round. So, don't be stupid and throw the case into 
  inaccessible areas of he map. Also note that a bug in Q2 lets your throw items 
  through glass windows. Server ops are very keen towards kicking players who 
  repeatedly spoil the game, so while it's great to hide the briefcase, make sure 
  you can get it back when your team needs to score. The latest build of MBCTB 
  will respawn cases that get stuck behind a door or under a moving elevator, 
  but the code can't tell the difference between an accessible and inaccessible 
  hiding place.</p>
<h2>9. What's in those briefcases anyways?</h2>
<p>Golden Twinkies.</p>
<h2>10. Where do I get the server DLL?</h2>
