The radio works on a simple idea, you can queue up to 5 messages to send to either your whole team or your partner. Partner you ask? We'll get to that. First here's the commands you need to know.

radiogender

Type this in followed by 'male' or 'female' to set your gender for speaking over the radio. Defaults to male.

radio_power

Set to 0 (for off), or 1 (for on), this defaults to on. Switch off that radio and you can neither send or recieve transmissions, but if some punk is floodding you, you might just wanna switch it off.

channel

A setting of 1 sets your radio to a channel with your partner only.
A setting of 0 sets your radio to a channel that includes your entire team. Use sparingly, as this can be confusing!

partner

You use this command to select a partner. Here's how the system works:
Using the id feature, you look at your desired partner until their name is listed at the bottem of the screen. Then type partner. This will alert them that you want to be their partner. They can confirm this by looking back at you and typing partner. Or they can deny it with the command:

deny

Simple enough? It's fairly intuitive, and you can quickly pair up into partners, a much more organzied way to play and communicate.

Finally, the actual radio commands:

radio (followed with a message, sends the message to the channel you set with 'radio_partner' or 'radio_team'

radioteam (followed with a message, sends the message to the whole team)

radiopartner (followed with a message, sends the message to your partner only).

simple enough, but you must follow these with the message.... here's a list:

// The following are simply numbers, when you type 'radio 4', it says "4" to everyone on your channel. Used in conjunction with other messages, you can convey more accurately your situation.

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10

// The following are the directional messages. Used in conjunction with the command messages (further below), you can convey in what direction the information is.
forward
back
left
right
up
down

// The following are commands, and are explained below

// "Taking Fire"
taking_f
// "Enemy Spotted"
enemys
// "Enemy Down"
enemyd
// "I'm Hit!"
im_hit
// "Teammate down"
teamdown
// "Cover me!"
cover
// "GO!"
go
// "Team, report in"
treport
// "Reporting in"
reportin


Here's an example situation. You bind the commands like 'radio enemys', 'radio 2', and 'radio left' (bind all of them, these are just examples)... Then your running with your partner and on the partner channel. You see 2 enemies to the left of the building, so you hit the 3 buttons in order.. the radio comes on and you say '*hiss-click* 2... enemy spotted... left... *hiss-click*'. Your partner thinks 'WOW that sounded cool', and then proceeds to flank the enemy and you win because you communicated.

In general, you should stick to the 'radio_partner' channel, because generally your team will not be with you all at the same time. However, you may wanna bind a couple keys that are useful for the whole team:
good examples are 'treport', 'reportin', 'enemyd', and 'teamdown'...

These will alert your team to the general status of the team and its enemies.

Got it? Good..
