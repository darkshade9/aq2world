<P><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you are done with your map, and certain that it is the final version

<font size="2" face="Verdana">
Action Quake2 relies mostly on external people to create maps for the mod.
This way, we can get many more maps then most mods have, and have more
free time to work on the mod itself.</font></p>

<P><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you have made maps before, then this information is for you. If not,
I suggest going to a map tutorial site like <A HREF="http://www.gamedesign.net">Rust</A>,
and grabbing a map editor (I suggest <A HREF="http://www.qoole.com">Qoole</A>).</font></p>

<P><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, on to the information:</font></p>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1 color="#FFC002" face="Verdana">Style</FONT></CENTER>



<P><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are looking for maps with an action movie feel, a warehouse, a dance
hall, a hospitol, a mall, etc. (try to be original) Scenes from certain movies
 come to mind, try and replicate those... If you make a quality map then it will be
 put up on the Map Depot and our ftp site. Except for certain entities such as
 the weapons and ammo, there is nothing particular to Action Quake2 you need
 to learn. You don't have to do anything special to make doors 'openable', other
 than possibly make them 'toggle'. If you, for example, don't know how to do this, 
try a map tutorial site like <A HREF="http://www.gamedesign.net">Rust</A>. </font>

<CENTER><P><font face="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=+1 color="#FFC002">Action Quake2 Entities</FONT></CENTER>
<font size="2">
Instead of using .ent files, we've decided that using Quake2 Equivilents
is the way to go. Whereever you want a certain Action Quake2 weapon or
ammo, just place the Q2 Equivilent from the list below:</font></font></p>

<P><font size="2" face="Verdana">Shotgun = M3 Super90 AssaultShotgun
<BR>Machinegun = MP5/10 SubMachinegun
<BR>Rocketlauncher = Handcannon
<BR>Chaingun = Sniper Rifle
<BR>Grenades = M26 Fragmentation Grenade
<BR>BFG10K = M4 Assault Rifle</font>
</p>

<P><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here is the ammo list:
<BR>Box o' bullets = Pistol clip
<BR>Box o' shells = 7 pack of shells
<BR>Box o' rockets = Machinegun Magazine
<BR>Box o' slugs (railgun) = Sniper ammo
<BR>Box o' cells = M4 ammo</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Knives can't be placed.  You start with one and the only way to get more 
is by killing people</font></p>

<P><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's it! You need not worry about items such as the kevlar vest, they

spawn automatically in respawn sites like in CTF.</font></p>

<P><font size="2" face="Verdana">For doors to work like real doors, make them
rotating_door, toggle,

and wait -1 so they will stay open/closed.</font></p>

<P><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you are done with your map, and certain that it is the final version

and worthy of Action Quake2, go to the <A HREF="http://aqmd.telefragged.com/" target="_top">Action Quake2 Map Depot</A> to upload it!
