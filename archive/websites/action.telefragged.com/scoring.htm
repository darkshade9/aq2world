Quick definitions:

<BR>&nbsp;

<UL><B>Kill: </B>When you get credit for killing an enemy in Action Quake,

by any means necessary. This is to be recognized as separate from:

<P><B>Frags: </B>The points you rack up, usually, but not always (as in

this system), synonymous with kills.</UL>

Now on to the system:

<UL>The way it works is this. As you get more and more kills in a row (in

a row means without dying), you get more frags. As your 'kill count' doubles,

so do the amount of frags you receieve.

<P>Once you reach the 'threshold' of 4 frags in a row (4 frags without

dying yourself), bonus's kick in.. At this point, every time you kill someone

you get two frags (it also lets everyone know that you have that many frags

in a row. Every kill after that get 2 frags per kill after that, until

you die or reach 8 frags in a row. It doubles as your kill count (in a

row) doubles. At 8 kills in a row, each kill counts for 4 frags! At 16

kills in a row, each frag counts for an incredibly 8 frags. You can see

how simple this is and how fast your frags would accumulate if you could

stay alive that long. For this reason, we recommend upping server fraglimits!

<P>Here's a chart for those who like neat-o diagrams:

<TD>I think 16 frags per kill is enough...</TD>

</TABLE></CENTER>

You get the idea. If anyone was insane enough to get to 16 kills in a row,

they deserve 8 frags per kill! If they get to 32, well then they almost

certainly already won anyway.

<P>Of course, some of the same stuff would apply. For now, the only indicator

is text messages at the top of the screen (and your frag count increasing

really fast). However, we are planning on adding some HUD indicators, as

well as possibly some in game effects to let people know that someone is

Stayin' Alive!
