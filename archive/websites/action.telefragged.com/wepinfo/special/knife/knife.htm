Ahhh your trusty combat knife. You are always equipped with at least one of these, and collect another one for each person you kill. The SOG 37 represents the perfect utility knife. It can cut a rope, or save your life. This knife is so good, that it has become the official knife of the Navy SEALS. It is made of stainless steel, so it won't rust or chip. It has a scratch resistant powder coating, to prevent shininess and that makes it more stealthy. This weapon is perfect to use with silent slippers for that quiet ambush. When you kill someone with this knife there is almost no noise, except the victim suffocating, or choking on his own blood. This knife is weighted so it can be used as a throwing knife, as well as a hand-held one. Due to its immense weight, compared to bullets, it has a huge downward deviation when thrown. You have to compensate for this by aiming slightly higher than your target. The farther your target is, the higher you have to aim. The best way to get good with this knife is to practice. Obviously the silencer and laser-sight do not apply here. When you hit someone with this weapon, it causes the same damage as a sniper rifle bullet; which is a lot. One hit to the chest or stomach and it's an instant early grave. When you choose Combat Knives as a weapon in teamplay you get 10 of these sharp-edged things, and double that with a bandolier. Oh yeah, and one more thing; these babies will shread right through a kevlar vest, so the only thing stopping you from that victory... is your aim.
