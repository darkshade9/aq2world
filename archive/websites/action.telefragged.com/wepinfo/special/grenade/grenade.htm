The grenade is the hands-down most strategic weapon in the lot. There's nothing like timing the throw of a grenade to have your enemy's limbs pierced by pieces of sharp shrapnel. The M26 Fragmentation Grenade is a lemon bodied explosive, perfect for clearing out small rooms. It can be pretty satisfying killing someone with a grenade. Using the '<b>weapon</b>' bind you can manipulate the throwing distance. You can choose between '<b>short</b>', '<b>medium</b>', or '<b>long</b>'. The distance also depends on how long you hold the fire button, after pulling the pin. A proficient user can get the grenade to land within inches of his desired landing spot. The grenade has an increased blast radius than that of the original Quake 2 grenade. If you throw it at anything less than '<b>long</b>', be prepared to run back, because you will most likely to get caught in its blast. If you hear a pin being pulled, and a grenade being thrown, the best way to avoid it, is to run at your opponent, or the direction he is running. This is because <i>he</i> knows where the grenade landed, and is running the opposite direction. You, however, cannot see the grenade, because it is almost impossible to spot on the ground, (if you <b>do</b> see it, it's probably to late) so you run where your enemy is running, because the grenade can be in front of you, right beside you, or even behind you. Once thrown it takes about 2 seconds to blow. You cannot select this weapon in teamplay because it would make the game unbalanced. One person can take a grenade, and throw it all at the opposing team, and about 40% of them would die, if they were relativley close together. There has been a rather large debate on this idea, with some suggesting that it be a server-side option. As of now, there is no grenade in teamplay. So if you like pulling things and making them blow up, you'll have to join a DM game.
