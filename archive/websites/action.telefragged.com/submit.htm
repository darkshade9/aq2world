Perhaps your wicked with 3dsmax, or have a professional sound studio. You
don't need that map/skin kidstuff, you want to send us something else.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's great! However, just because it looks cool, works well, or fits
the theme doesn't mean it's going in. However, we want outside stuff, so
send it in. If we like it and think it belongs in the next version, we
will include it. Send all submissions to <A HREF="mailto:suislide@telefragged.com">me</A>.
If you didn't do the work, provide a link to who did. Do not, for example,
send me somone else's PPM!  Instead, tell me the PPM is appropriate and let me
 know where I can get it.</font>
 
 <P><font size="2" color="#FFC002" face="Verdana">UPDATE (02/21/99): go to <a href="http://guild.telefragged.com">guild.telefragged.com</a>
and submit your models there, and if people like it, they can vote for it, and it
just might turn into an official skin!! Visit the Actor's Guild.</font></p>
