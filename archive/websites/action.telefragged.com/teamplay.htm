<P>Teamplay is most popular form of this mod.

<P>Teamplay in Action Quake2 is fairly similar to experiances you may have had in Pickup Team games of <A HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/arena/">Rocket Arena2</A>. You select a team, as you would in CTF or any other teamplay mod, and then the game starts.

<P>In AQ2 Teamplay, when you die, you stay dead for the round. A round ends when one of the teams wins (or the teams tie), by achieving their objective : eliminating the other team.

<P>The server keeps track of the rounds (similar to CTF), and uses that to decide which team wins.

<P><BR>

<P>In AQ2 Teamplay, there is only one thing that counts:

<P>The complete elimination of the other team's players. Known as 'Normal Teamplay', this is accomplished by simply shooting them. Once all the players from one team are dead by any means, the server waits 5 seconds. If there is at least one member of the opposite team still alive, then that team wins the round, gaining a point (sort of like in CTF). If both teams are destroyed within those 5 seconds, then it is a tie, and the round doesn't count.

<P><BR>

<P>Each player starts off with their choice of 1 special weapon and 1 item. The only thing that they can not choose is the grenade.  However, there are some things like choosing 10 knives rather than a regular special weapon.  Players get to rechoose at the beginning of each round, since their preferences may change.

<P>The server can (like in CTF) either set a 'Roundlimit' to end the map, or have it done by frag/time limits.. However, we highly recommend a Roundlimit..



<P>Servers will set the two teams, they are be divided by model/skin.. its completely up to the server, in the same external .ini file. The name of each team is also determined by this .ini file, essientially, you could have a 'Cops v. Robbers', or 'Reservoir Dogs v. Swat' (the example we playtested with)...

<P>A few of the cool features:
<UL>
<LI>Bodies, ammo, weapons, blood, everything is cleared at the beginning of each round...</LI>
<LI>No death messages in Action Quake2 teamplay. That way, you can take out the other team without them knowing! This also promotes communication (ie, 'reporting in' every minute or so).. stealth is REALLY useful now... </LI>
<LI>Once your dead and in observermode, you can only talk to other 'ghosts'. If you try to talk to non-ghosts, you will simply write "oooOoOoOOooooooOOo". (Note: this was a joke, if you get it, you get it =P ) Seriously, you simply can only talk to ghosts, to chat and pass the time (if watching mind blowing action is boring for you). 
<LI>And much much more!</LI>
