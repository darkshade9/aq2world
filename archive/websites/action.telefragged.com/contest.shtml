<p><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>CURRENT DEALINE IS JUNE 5th.  ALL ENTRIES SHOULD BE IN BY JUNE 5th.  Late entries may or may not be accepted depending on how late they are and how busy I am when the deadline rolls around.</FONT></p>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><p>Send all submissions to <a href="mailto:actiontshirt@telefragged.com">actiontshirt@telefragged.com</a></p></FONT>
<p>I am going to keep this page as simple as possible and give you only the info you need.  No fluffy pictures or anything here.</p>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><P>WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT:</P>
</FONT><p>Quite a few months back a couple of us were chatting about nothing in particular and decided it would be pretty damn cool if we could have some Action Quake T-shirts.  So I asked on the messageboard and the interest in it from the fans seemed high as well.  Nothing happened until now though.  I am ready to get it all going and have the printing etc. all worked out.  The designs for the shirts are what I don't have.  I could do them all myself but I (and a lot of other people) think it is best if atleast some of the designs come from a contest.  So here it is, the Action Quake T-Shirt Design Contest.</p>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><P>WHAT YOU CAN WIN:</P></FONT>
<p>The amount of winners totally depends on the submissions I get.  If I only get one good submission then I will give all the prizes to one guy.  If I get 3 good submissions (which Is almost certain) then there will be the full 3 winners.  1st, second, and third.  <FONT COLOR=#ff0000>There are 3 prizes</FONT> (so far) for you to win.  A <FONT COLOR=#ff0000>Sound Blaster Live</FONT> card (brand new retail)  --- <FONT COLOR=#ff0000>Any game</FONT> you choose (within reason).  ---  and some <FONT COLOR=#ff0000>artist prints</FONT> of the magic the gathering card "<FONT COLOR=#ff0000>Elves of deep shadow</FONT>" from the Magic: the Gathering artist Jesper Myrfors  (might even have sketches on the back).</p>
<p>The first place winner will recieve his choice of the prizes (I would assume he will probably take the SBLive card but he doesn't have to)</p>
<p>The second place winner will recieve his choice of the remaining two prizes</p>
<p>The third place winner will recieve the remaining third prize.</p>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><p>RULES:</p></FONT>
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>1. </FONT>The shirt designs must be designed for use on a white shirt.  You can have a black background behind the picture but the black will be printed onto a white whirt.</p>
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>2. </FONT>The actual designs must contain both a front and back</p>
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>3. </FONT>The front/back designs can consist of any colors and any  number of colors.</p>
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>4. </FONT>The front/back designs do NOT have to contain the word action or the letters AQ2 or any other Action Designation</p>
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>5. </FONT>The shirts can NOT contain any copyrighted materials (including but not limited to the quake2 symbol</p>
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>6. </FONT>The front/back design can be either text or graphics or a combination of both</p>
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>7. </FONT>Shirts that contain 2 large designs instead of one large design and some small text will wind up costing more to make, so keep that in mind</p>
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>8. </FONT>The designs can be black and white, greyscale, etc. if you want them to be.</p>
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>9. </FONT>The designs MUST in some way relate to action quake.</p>
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>10. </FONT>The largest your design can be is 8 inches wide by 10 inches tall.</p>
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>11. </FONT>Designs SHOULD be atleast 150 dpi.  If you do not know what that means then ask me.  If you use a prgram that does not support dpi then just make the design twice as big as you want it to be or something.  If the designs do not have enough detail then the shirts will not look as good.</p>
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>12. </FONT>All designs will be judged by me in any manner or fashion I deem fit.  I will most likely consult with others or even put up a voting booth on the AQ page but the final decision is mine and mine alone.</p>
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>13. </FONT>The prizes are definately intended to be given out but are subject to change or withdrawal at any time.  This does not mean I am going to rip you off.  What this means is that if something happens where I am somehow unable to supply the prizes then I don't want people trying to sue my ass over it.  (i.e. if they get stolen, I get hit by a tornado, a band of rogue ninjas with a hatred for sound cards attacks the SBLive, etc.)
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>14. </FONT>The prizes will be sent out shortly after the winner is publicly announced.</p>
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>15. </FONT>All responsability, liability,  taxes, etc. for the prizes are the sole responsibility of the prize winner.</p>
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>16. </FONT>If the prizes fuck something up on your end or get broken then it is your problem.</p>
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>17. </FONT>All submissions MUST be in ZIP or some other compression format.  If you do not know how to do this then email me and ask.</p>
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>18. </FONT>There will be atleast one winner and up to 3 winners.  This is solely my choice to make.</p></B>
<p><FONT COLOR=#800080>19. </FONT>YOU ARE NOT RESTRICTED TO ONE ENTRY!!  SEND IN AS MANY AS YOU CAN!</p>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><p>Send all submissions to <a href="mailto:actiontshirt@telefragged.com">actiontshirt@telefragged.com</a></p></FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><P>HELPFUL STUFF (maybe):</P></FONT>
<p>You could do a design based totally on one area of Action Quake.  For example, you could have a hand drawn picture of a guy hilding a smoking hand cannon.</p>
<p>You could do a design containing all the models or a mock screenshot, etc.</p>
<p>You can go to the store and look at other t-shirts and get ideas off them (for these prizes it is worth it)</p>
<p>You can do renders, hand drawn stuff, edited pictures of renders (screenshots from a model viewer are an example of a render)</p>
<p>If you are good with max you can bind a model to a biped, pose it how you want, add a meshsmooth modifier, and then edit the render in photoshop or something.</p>
<p>You can work with other people (brothers, friends, etc.) But you will still only get one prize :)</p>
<p>Comic books, movies, magazine adds, and even web pages can provide some great ideas.</p>
<p>You can have a design with no text at all or you can have a design that is all text.  Or combine the twe.</p>
<p>Some really cool concert t0shirts are out there (flea markets are a good place to find them).  Some of the designs form them would be great to use as inspiration</p>
<p>If nothing else works ask other people what they think would be cool on a shirt.</p>
<p>If you make it an Action design and don't put the AQ or anything like that on the shirts then when Action Half Life comes out they will work for both (maybe).  :)</p>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><p>Send all submissions to <a href="mailto:actiontshirt@telefragged.com">actiontshirt@telefragged.com</a></p></FONT>
<p>NEED TO ADD IN GENEROUS SPONSOR'S INFO AND BUTTONS HERE.  Until then know that these people kick ass and provided the prizes you can win: Hidden from hidden.org amoung other things (same guy who recently added ftp mirrors to help us out), jesper myrfors of MT:G fame (damn cool artist), and Unorthodox of intallect.com and twelveinch.com amoung other things (same guy form the Actor's Guild)</p>
