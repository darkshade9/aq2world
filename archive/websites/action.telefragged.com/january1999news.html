                I am going to make this short because I want everyone to make sure to get that
                model pack.  If you haven't read yesterdays update then read it first.  If you
                have, then go ahead with this one.

                First off is that there is a Scandanavian only league of Action Quakers for the
                Scandanavians to sign up for now.  Here is what the guy running has to say in
                his own words:
                <BR>
                <FONT COLOR=#ffffff>
                        Get a little practice with the akimbos, adjust that sniper aim, sharpen the
                        knives, give the M4 clips an oil-bath, go over your vest and cast some new
                        shells for the handcannon - It's gearing up for some serious bloodshed in the
                        icy norths where Scandinavia's finest prepare for a heartpounding fight to the
                        very end - Welcome to the Norse Warriors AQ2 League.
                </FONT>

                There is a program I had someone make for me that makes all linux files
                lowercase.  I am having someone test it to make sure before you guys get it but
                I want to say that from now on I would appreciate it if everyone who makes
                anything that they are submitting for AQ would make it all lowercase to make it
                easier on our linux users.  There are some discrepencies going around with
                servers that make it hard for people and this is just one that that should make
                that a little easier.  So from now on the standard for all AQ files is that
                they will be all lowercase.  Please follow this and spread the word around
                (especially if you know someone who uses linux).
                </P>

                For those of you who are wondering and asking about Action for Half Life.  Here
                is some info for you.  The mod is coming along nicely so far.  I am getting to
                grips with 3dsMax and character studio.  Progress is being made in every
                section of the mod and although we aren't giving out much info yet we are
                actual doing things believe it or not.  The release date is not set yet so when
                you ask me that quaestion the answer will always be I don't know.  I am
                contemplating putting up a screenshot or two but I probably won't yet just
                because there really isn't any reason to as it stands now.  Also, we do not
                need weapon suggestions for this because it is mostly a port of Action Quake. 
                Though there will be some changes in the weapons and of course other things we
                don't need any input on things like weapons yet.  If you have a grand idea for
                a feature that you think nobody else has thought of then send it to me though
                and it will be considered.  Please don't send obvious stuff like "make it ctf",
                or "add ir vision and a rocket launcher".  Also, although we are and always
                have been very open to people submitting things we simply don't really need
                much help at this stage in things.  Later on once it is released or near before
                the first release it will probably be a better time for that sort of thing.  If
                you want to help right now then make some maps that work for Half Life.  Make
                them in the AQ style of maps but try to use the Half Life features to make them
                better than the present maps.  With things like transparent areas on brushes
                you can do amazing things (like trees, fences, grates).  So for all of you who
                wanted a little info on what was going on, there you have it.  Also, if you own
                weapons and are willing to scan in pictures of them then let me know.  I could
                really use some nice images.  Please don't send pics you grabbed off the net
                though.  Mostly what I need are angles like the rear of the gun, the under side
                of the gun, or the very front.  For some reason those angles are near
                impossible to find for most weapons.

                Ok, this is one of those type of updates that usually drag's Telefragged's
                servers to it's knees with downloads.  So if you guys could spread the word via
                the servers and stuff I would appreciate it.  Probably a few people not looking
                at the page since I haven't updated in what seems like eons (that means a long
                time in case you went to John Marshall high School like I did).
                </P>
                <P>
                Well, basically the Actor's Guild is open for visitors.  That also means there
                are some downloads to be made.  Sorry if you hate downloads but you will be
                seeing more reservoir dog skins than ever unless you make this download.  The
                first model pack for Action Quake is now online.
                </P>
                <P>
                Before I list what is in it let me also give a huge thank you out to the people
                who make the skinview mod for letting me announce the Action Quake version of
                skinview even though it took me longer than it should have.  Worked with them
                for a while and convinced them to add Action Quake support to the Skinview mod.
                What they actually did is added open ended support for just about every mod
                with custom vwep but since it working with AQ wsn't enough I decided to make my
                own version and that is what you will be getting.  It is an Actor's Guild
                exclusive and please do not distribute it on other sites.  The skinview team
                did me a big favor by doing this for me and the last thing I want to do is
                confuse people by having the AQ version accidentaly downloaded by someone who
                doesn't want it.  Don't worry if you want both though since my version installs
                to a different directory.
                </P>
                <P>
                Ok, here is what is in the model pack.  (I wonder how many people skipped down
                to this part):
                <BR>
                <UL type="disc">
                        <LI>
                        New Sydney Player Model (Action Quake version with full vwep and compatible
                        with old sydney skins)
                        <LI>
                        M player model (first ever model with Varms instead of vweps, author Oddjob)
                        <LI>
                        Shotgun Messiah player model with full vwep support (thanx goes out to the
                        Shotgun Messiah clan for this one)
                        <LI>
                        Oddjob player Model with full vwep support (from oddjob)
                        <LI>
                        some skins for the ActionMale player model (good ones from the awesome skinners
                        Mr. Kill and Mr. No)
                        <LI>
                        Other things I believe I got into the pack before I zipped it up:
                        <LI>
                        a skin for the female player model
                        <LI>
                        a couple other things I am sure I am forgetting.
                        <LI>
                        Oh yeah, I made a couple leeloo skins for the Sydney model as well to get
                        people in the skinning mood.  I forgot to rename them before I made the zip
                        though so use at your own risk or something since they are mostly for
                        motivational purposes.
                </UL>
                <P>
                A couple of other things to note before I send you off to the Actor's Guild to
                get these goodies.  First is that if you are having problems where your name is
                always Suislide then go to you quake2/action/ directory and delete the file
                called autoexec.cfg.  I can't believe how many folks are still running around
                using my name.  If you see someone named Suislide on a server please tell them
                how to do this.  Not only will it save a lot of headaches but the name Suislide
                has been banned form quite a few servers so you could wind up losing some good
                playing spots if you don't listen to this.  Second, there will not be any new
                weapons in Action Quake so stop asking.  For the time being I respond to these
                with a polite no and a reason but I am going to start ignoring weapon request
                email totally.  I'd
                rather not have to do that.  Third, there is no bot that works with action
                quake yet but there is one being worked on by someone and I assure you when it
                is done I will announce it on this page.
                </P>

                UPDATE:  I smacked out Neo Omega's Update because I didn't think to download
                news.htm before I edited it since I am so used to all the updates being mine.
                If I remember right basically what he said was that he was working hard on a
                new design for this page.  He came to us a LONG time ago offering to do one and
                a billion things have happened since then.  So he and I have been working
                together on a design and he has been doing all the web monkey stuff.  I think
                he said something about if you have specific suggestions to email him or
                soemthign like that.  So here is his email
                <A HREF="mailto:demalex@ix.netcom.com">Neo Omega</A>
                .  Sorry about that Neo Omega.

                        Wow, what a long ass update.  Now I have to go edit the html on the Guild
                        site to coincide with all this stuff.  I hope you all enjoy this because it
                        takes me forever to upload that stuff at 26.4. Of course I wouldn't do it if I
                        didn't want to so I guess that says something or other.

                Welp folks.  The messageboard has been taken down for now.  You see, Sunlight
                reflected off the underbelly of an unimaginably shiny spacecraft filtered
                through some radioactive swamp gas cause some scalding hot acid rain to melt
                the outer layer of the worlds largest cheeseball which proceeded to roll over
                Bartender's house and so he is laying unconcious alongside his unworking
                computer trapped by a large inpenetrable mass of boiling hot cheese which is as
                you know, is Bartender's only true weekness.  Seeing as how I am the cheese
                p1mp I can simply not bring myself to interfere in his life threatening fight
                with the cheese.  So the board is without a moderator and so the board is
                simply gone for now.  If you guys have any suggestions as to new Messageboard
                systems that have good moderator abilites and can handle a LARGE number of
                posts a day then please email me and let me know.  My email is on the bar above

                Sorry to say that although all the content and preliminery HTML is done for the
                Actor's Guild that a problem with UPLOADING said content has caused a minor
                delay in it's opening.  So that big update I was promising may take an extra

                In cooler news, Gabe Newell mentioned us on Shooters.   I took the liberty to
                write down what was said (or very close to what was said) so anyone who is
                unwilling to watch the 52 minute realvieo show can atleast hear the small
                portion about our beloved mod.  So without further BS:

                                You guys should actually have them on the show.  I, I think that people will be
                                pretty excited to hear about their experiences and hearing about what they've
                                learned by working with half life.

                I would like to point out in fact that in fact, we have NOT ever been on
                shooters regardless of what Blue and Loonyboi may remember.   I did talk to
                Loonyboi in an IRC chat one time for a few seconds though, but that hardly
                counts.  Been watching on and off since the very first QuakeCast (it's old
                name) and I would know if any of us had been on it.  Maybe you guys should let
                him
                know that. :)   Here is his email...

                </P>
                <P>
                Ok, before anyone emails me about this.  I may have missed or mistaken one or
                two words.  Hell, I may even have mixed up Blue and Loonyboi once.  Who knows.
                But this should give you a general idea of what was said.  You should watch the
                show anyways since this particular show was quite good.

                I added 2 buttons to our little button row on this page.  One should be obvious
                since it is Clanspot and the other I will explain later in the update.

                I also added a new and updated servers page to the toolbar (woohoo).  It is big
                and I have not tested it much.  It was made and will be updated by warrlock_3.
                Thanks goes out to him.  His email can be found on the servers page.

                Here in a day or two there will be a place for all the skins, models, and
                miscilaneous stuff such as replacement skins or crosshairs.  So stay tuned to
                this page for an even bigger update than this one here real soon.  Some
                interesting things that I am sure everyone will want (and need) will be
                released there when it opens.  Stay tuned.

                A new site is opened and I have a policy of not actualy announcing new fan
                pages as not to play favoritist.  This is a different type of page the author
                assures me, though and that it is not really a fan page as a much as a place
                for people to gather.  So here is an unedited (except for adding the html tags
                in) blurb from him:

                        together to share tactics and all around communicate.I have noticed alot
                        of you are tired of immature flamerz ruining good TP matches.Hopefully
                        the guild will help eliminate this somewhat.come to my page and check it
                        out.Dont flame me for the page i was in a rush to get this going IT WILL
                        Improve:P

                        1 MILLION HITS!!!! WOOHOO!!!.  Ok, so we have had nearly 3 million total hits
                        and this is the second time we broke 1 million (I think).  But since the
                        counter has been reset a few times it is nice to see it back up to a million.
                        Thanks to all the visitors.  I was going to announce the person who hit the
                        million mark but it seems some people are kind of weird and want the credit
                        given falsely.  How do I know that?  Well, I got 4 screenshots from 4 different
                        people and more from people without screenshots.  So I have decided to say
                        congrats to whoever in the hell is the real person since he hit the million
                        mark.  Sorry I can't know who is the real person.

                so I can nclude them.  2 skins (1 of which came with it) is NOT enough.  I
                don't get why nobody is making any.  Do you guys not like this model or
                something?
                </P>

                OK, now I will explain the WON button I mentioned above.
                </P>
                <P>
                I am sure most people remember me looking for 3dsMax2 and Character studio.
                Well, WON has helped me out with that problem.  He also helped me out with my
                computer.  Nothing too fancy and I don't want to say exactly our deal unless I
                ask first but no matter how it comes down this is a great deal for me and it
                helps everyone involved.  Helps you guys because I can do models for Half Life
                now.  helps me for obvious reasons.  Helps WON because they get that link and
                some other small things that are more than worth it.  I kind of like the way
                the button looks myself and although I didn't know until the other day, they
                have a pretty useful site actually.  You should check it out (no he didn't tell
                me to say any of this.)

                Thanks goes out to DOOManiac for being the first to point out that there was a
                javascript error on the page that appeared rcently.  Not sure if I caused it
                when I fixed a bunch of sudden problems with the code or if it is one of those
                problems I missed.  I checked it out myself though and I have it fixed.
                Hopefully it doesn't rear it's ugly little head again.

                If you are a skinner and like Action Quake then please make skins.  I know
                people think their may be no outlet for such things since thir is no real 'skin
                page' at the moment but there will be something very soon for you guys.
                Hopefully within a week.  We are also always looking for new player models.

                I have someone working on a new servers page and he plans to update it and keep
                it updated.  It should be posted in the next few days.  I did not receive a lot
                of email about the servers page but I did receive enough to warrant such an
                effort.  So for you guys who hate programs like Gamespy (or can't get them
                working), it is time to rejoice :)

                The full version client pak now has both fixes built into it.  This only goes
                for the FULL Client pack download and only the .exe version file for now.  I
                will update the other files when I can but I upload so dang slow it is hard to
                find a sufficient chunk of time.

                Once again I ask all people who have NOT made their own autoexec.cfg files and
                are running around using the name Suislide to delete the autoexec.cfg file in
                their Action directory (or atleast edit it to change the name).  I had
                forgotten this problem for a while until only today.

                We won the number one spot for mod of the year over at
                <A href="http://www.planetquake.com/modcentral/">ModCentral's</A>
                1998 mod of the year.  Seems we took everything we were nominated for as well
                as their personal #1 spot.  Too cool.  Thanks goes out to all the people who
                supported us with their votes for the user poll section as well as the
                Modecentral staff for flattering us.  Thanks also goes out to all the people
                who have ever contributed to AQ2 wether by making something, submitting ideas,
                running servers, or simply by playing and enjoying the mod.  We love you guys.

                It seems there is a new Yahoo type site that is edited by it's readers (cool
                beans).  I
                recieved a request to post this in one of my emails so I figured it was the
                least I could do for someone who volunteered to edit the AQ section :)  So go
                submit all of your sites there.  Here is the blurb:

                I did a little repairing to the page.  It seems with all the editor conflicts
                from my friends' editors constantly making the code uglier and uglier every
                update that some things just sort of broke after a while.  Got so bad that my
                text editor didn't like opening it because there was a line with so many
                characters in a row that it thought it was a 3 line long word or something.  Oh
                well, for now the code is a little prettier and the map depot button is back
                and some other small things are fixed.  (Tons and tons of HTML errors such as
                unmatched tags and other crap you probably don't care about)

                I also updated the ports page so now you can go there to get to our Linux port

                <A href="http://www.ogl.org/">OGL Homepage</A>

                I am posting up a melee guide from McDizzo.  I haven't edited it at all to fit
                the pages format, so for now I will only post the link here in the news update.
                Later I will try to conform it a little and then probably post it along with
                the sniper guide.  Check it out by clicking
