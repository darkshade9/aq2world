			The new messageboard is up, thanks goes to Fex for hosting so long and Shagg
			for taking the role on now.
			</p>
			<p>
			Also,
			<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/borderfield/">iAQMD</a>
			is a very cool program and will help people keep track of their maps.  I
			recommend every Action fan check it out.
			</p>
			<p>
			On to less positive news.
			</p>
			<p>
			I have decided that my personal work on AQ2 will be minimal to none from now
			on.  I may update this page from time to time if something truly important
			happen but the vast majority of news will go to
			<a href="http://ahl.action-web.net">The Action Half Life main page</a>
			.  I will still also answer some of the AQ2 related mail I get, though I hope
			that some of the more general questions can be sent to fan sites and the
			messageboard.  If you have something that needs to come to me then don't
			hesitate to send, but for generic questions I would appreciate if you try
			others first as there are many good fan sites that are run by competent
			individuals who can answer your questions.
			</p>
			<p>
			This in no way means that Action Quake2 is dead or even dying.  With the
			release of the source we have seen a bot, multiple spin off mods, ctf versions,
			single player, and many more.  The Guild is still kicking with new optionals,
			etc. all the time as well and the entire mod itself is still kicking and
			growing.  This simply means that my personal involvement in these processes,
			already laxing, will be almost none.
			</p>
			<p>
			I know that some of you were looking forward to the final pack I had spoken of
			but I will no longer be working on it.  If Fireblade comes up with the
			motivation to make a final update then I will support that decision, but that
			is as far as it goes for official mod releases.
			</p>
			<p>
			This is my own personal statement and all official sites can remain running as
			they currently are.  I have weaned myself out of their processes already and my
			leave should have little or no effect on their ability to operate.  For general
			news however, I recommend that you go to a fan site such as action world, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
			There will also no longer be any distribution by magazine or any other non net
			form as in the past it has only served to upset exactly those people who it was
			intended to assist.  All future distribution of the mod will be from this
			page's current files and anyone who decides to mirror the files electronically
			and unaltered.  The only exclusion to this would be any current distribution I
			have no control over.  I can only hope the rest of the team will honor this as
			well.
			</p>
			<p>
			This mod has been in the making for nearly two years and has seen more time and
			effort from myself and many others than any project I have previously been
			involved in.  It had to happen sooner or later and it is happening 
			<b>
				much
			</b>
			 later.
			For all practical purposes it is mature and bug free.  This mod is Officially
			done.
			</p>
			<p>
			With that in mind I want to thank everyone who has been involved in making the
			mod what it currently is.  From the first players so long ago to the current
			community at large.  All of the webmasters of the official and fan sites have
			my gratitude.  All the server ops, without whom the mod could not be played
			over the net, also deserve a large thank you.  The skinners, mappers, texture
			artists, modelers, and everyone who has ever submitted an idea or content that
			has been used in any manner helped shape this project into what it is today
			have my gratitude and best wishes.  The sponsors and entrants to any contests I
			have held were and still are well appreciated.  Our code maintainers both past
			and present also most certainly have my thanks.  Siris, Gudlyf, Fireblade,
			Zucchini, and anyone who I am forgetting (or misspelled).  The largest thanks,
			however, goes to all the members of the A-team who worked with me on this
			project.  I consider them friends and have many fond memories because of them.
			I also want to thank everyone who ever tried to make any good person look bad.
			The world would truly be mundane without conflict.  It may sound cliche but I
			also thank id for making the engine that made AQ2 possible.
			</p>
			<p>
			I will be working on Action Half Life exclusively now, and I hope to see many
			familiar faces there.
			</p>
			<p>
			Almost forgot..  The source code is still there so all the mods of AQ2 are
			encouraged to stay with it.  I wish you all good luck.

			I would like to thank all the people who have helped out with the board, Fex,
			Shagg, Black Angel, Rookie... I'm sure I'm forgetting someone very important
			who will then berate me in the IRC channel.  Speaking of which, thanks to Fool
			Killer for running our semi-official IRC channel, #actionquake2 on EFnet.
			Also, check out AQ:E at aqdt.fear.net, it's really cool (happy now FK?).
			</p>
			<p>
			Thanks to everyone at Telefragged.  In case anyone out there is looking for
			hosting and is in doubt who to go to, come on over to TF with us.  I've had
			projects hosted on several of the big hosts and TF is by far the best.  If I
			ever needed anything (usually misplaced passwords) it was just an ICQ page
			away, the reliability is good, and you don't have to worry about getting lumped
			into some narrow grouping of games (Planet of The Quakes).
			</p>
			<p>
			Thank you all for the support you have given us over the past year and a half.
			Obviously we wouldn't be here without fans spreading the word.  And for those
			of you who joined us on a little clan server at 10pm one muggy night in April
			(well, was muggy where I was), thank you very much.  Without the suggestions
			and support you guys lent us we probably would have given up.  We had already
			spent a month looking for a host, longer than that looking for a test server,
			it was nice to have people waiting for us when we finally got it worked out.
			</p>
			<p>
			Thanks to everyone who went to the LANs, but most of you guys are in the
			credits anyway, so you don't really need this.
			</p>
			<p>
			Everyone comeon over to the channel and the board, as should be clear by now,
			AQ2 isn't gone and the community is still vibrant.
			</p>
			<a href="mailto:lacutis@cryogen.com">Lacutis</a>
			 has been put in charge of collecting all media clippings for the A-Team and
			all AQ2 and AHL related issues.  If you have a link to a review, a print
			editorial, or something from French Canadian TV, contact him.

			Fex can no longer host the messageboard.  The entire A-Team thanks him for
			providing a great service for all of us for so long.  I am sure the thousands
			of board visitors would also thank him.  Although I am sorry to see it go, I
			understand that he has hosted it much longer than many people could or would
			have.  I hope that everyone else will understand the same thing and avoid
			flooding him with emails on the subject.  The result is that we are looking for
			another host for the UBB messageboard, so if you are willing then please email
			us at
			<a href="mailto:ateam@telefragged.com">ateam@telefragged.com</a>
			or email me directly.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you haven't checked out the Actor's Guild in a while, I recommend you do so.
			Lot's of cool stuff in the optionals section especially.  Hammer just finished
			getting a news updating script that will make it easier and faster for them to
			keep you up to date.  Check it out.  (there is a button
			to it at the bottom of the page).
			</p>
			<p>
			I received a lot of emails from Action Quake2 fans asking when AHL beta will be
			out.  I am assuming that many of you do not know that Action Half Life has it's
			own home page.
			<a href="http://ahl.action-web.net">http://ahl.action-web.net</a>
			.  The first beta is out and an update will be coming shortly which will add
			the Staying Alive scoring for Deathmatch, Action style teamplay, a ton of bug
			fixes, a couple missing models/sounds, and the jump kick (maybe both jump
			kicks).  So go over there and check it out.
			</p>
			<p>
			The mod expo went very well and I will do a write up soon.  I am having a LOT
			of problems connecting faster than 14.4 and staying online any longer than a
			few minutes.  I think a recent storm must have nocked my phone lines out of
			wack, so right now I am having problems keeping up.  Please be patient.

			I pushed the contest deadline back to September 1st.  If you still want to
			enter there is plenty of time or if you are entering now there is time for
			multiple entries.  The push back is due to requests from a large portion of the
			people i know who are entering.

			Hot on the heals of the announcement that Action is Mac compatible on the
			client side is confirmation that BeOS will also run Action client side, so I am
			looking for a BeOS gamer/programmer to do a server port (is there such a thing
			as a BeOS gamer/programmer?!).  This brings Action (and most likely MANY of the
			Quake2 mods) up to a staggering sized compatability list.  Linux, BSD (with
			linux emulation), Windows95/98, windowsNT, Mac, BeOS, Solaris/Sparc, and even
			an uncomfirmed report of NextStep5.  That is a basically all the major
			platforms that I can think of.

			Old news for most of you who care, but there has been a newer version of CGF
			released that works with 2 maps instead of one now.
			</p>
			<p>
			For those of you wondering,
			<a gref="http://guild.action-web.net/">The Actor's Guild</a>
			will be providing the same services for AHL as it does for AQ2 now.  Not only
			that, but the optionals scene should be much bigger than it is now (which is
			saying a lot since most hard core fans have atleast one optional running).
			Action Half Life's skeletal system allows for some unique advantages in that
			area.  Not only that but I have sacrificed a little bit of detail on the weapon
			skins (not TOO much) so that they are extremely easy to reskin just by popping
			in a picture of the same model gun or by editing the current one.  Optionals
			are my babies, I love the freedom to customise your client to suit you in ways
			that are extreme but do not effect other's at all.  I am even considering a few
			other Optional oriented changes to AHL that I will announce if/when they make
			it.
			</p>
			<p>
			I look forward to seeing a few of you at the mod expo the 29th.  This is more
			than likely my last update until I get back.  I have a lot to do in order to
			prepare for the short trip so chances are there will not be time for another
			update.  I will definately fill you all in on how it went when I get back
			though.

				Those of you getting tired of not being able to hit people in the head when
				they duck, and the various other bugs in Action Quake2 are in luck.  The 1.52
				servr dll is finished and on the ftp servers.  It is server side only, so you
				do not need to download it unless you run a lan or net server.  Grab it off the
				server files page.  I do recommend that everyone read the text files though.  I
				receive emails asking about things that are covered in the dll readme very
				often.  If you do not wish to download the zip, you can find the readme
				<a href="README">here</a>
				and the changes
				<a href="CHANGES">here</a>
				.
				</p>
				<p>
				Here is the release text direct from Fireblade:
				<br>
				<FONT COLOR=#800080>
					<B>
						When upgrading your server to 1.52, be sure to read the first item in the
						CHANGES file (if not the whole thing)...you should change your "dmflags"
						to be 256 on a normal teamplay server (otherwise you will have friendly
						fire turned on).
						<br>
						<br>
						We'd like to thank the people who made this release possible, including
						our beta testers: JimmyHustle and Clan AR, Lurker and the Norwegian
						Whalers, and OvErR|De (with the NetNITCO teamplay server); and the people
						who made available patches for cool new stuff that is incorporated into
						1.52: Eek, Azerov, Mikael Lindh, Black Cross, William van der Sterren,
						Hal, and probably some others I missed (sorry).
					</B>

				For anyone who uses  a Mac and wants to play Action, your in luck.  There is
				NOT a server dll port of Action for the mac but I have it from multiple sources
				that Action Quake2 will work with the Quake2 port for the mac.  What this means
				is you can connect to a server and play just fine, though yu can not run a
				server of your own yet.  Our source is on the server files page, so anyone who
				is willing to port the server dll to the mac shoul grab it off there and let me
				know.  Once I get a working dll for the mac I will post it up for public
				download along with the others.  NOTE: I am looking for an unaltered version of
				Action, not a port with changes.
				</p>
				<p>
				The CGF bot is very cool, even in it's first early beta form.  The little
				bastards are mean too.  If you haven't tried it out yet, I recommend that you
				do.  This is no ordinary bot.  It is more along the lines of an advanced single
				player AI with scripted scenarios.  As a matter of fact, there is a page
				dedicated to housing everything related to the bot, and it already has quite a
				few new missions to play around with.
				<a href="http://surf.to/cgf_resource_site">http://surf.to/cgf_resource_site</a>
				.  I recommend anyone who has played their fill of the default missions go
				there and grab some new ones.  The face off one is cool if you have my gold
				akimbo skins from the Actor's Guild and the right player model (you will need
				both guild packs I think).
				</p>
				<p>
				The Action Player model contest is still running and I would really like to see
				some good entries come out of it.  Click on the CONTEST link to the left.
				</p>
				<p>
				Since there is a new dll and there will undoubtedly be a lot of new downloads,
				I want to inform all new people of what all the Action veterans already know.
				The autoexec.cfg in your action directory (when you first download the client
				zip) is my own personal one from a LONG time ago.  PLEASE either delete or edit
				it.  At the very least change the name.  There is a file called
				configexamples.zip which will help anyone who wants to make their own.
				</p>
				<p>
				Clanspot closed a while back and I left the button up so that anyone who wanted
				to see their goodbye ,essages could do so.  However, it has been long enough
				and I am taking down the button.  I will be putting the action spin offs site's
				button it it's place as soon as they make one.  I want to thank the Clanspot
				staff for their effort and time invested in the Action Quake clan scene.  They
				were around since very early on and I am sure even the people who did not go to
				site must realise the large part they played in creating that scene.
				</p>
				<p>
				The servers page has been replaced by a site specifically for Action servers.
				Check it out nd make sure that if you use the servers page in conjunction with
				gamespy or pingtool that you update the links.

				from hidden.org.  Nor only did he provide the cash for the cash prizes but also
				gave me enough that I should be able to ship without any problems.  He is a big
				action fan himself, runs servers, hosts clan pages, etc.  So do me a favor and
				check out his site.  He provides all kinds of services from shells to web
				hosting, as well as many other things (such as running multiple telefragged
				mirror sites JUST so Action has reliable download sources).
				<a href="http://www.hidden.org">hidden.org</a>
				, there is a button to his site below, not sure if it is back up fro the
				redesign yet, but check it out.  You'll have some cool models after all is said
				and done and he deserves some thanks for helping with it.  Won.net also
				provided 2 won.net games of choice (tribes, half life, etc.).  Sierra/valve
				provided 2 copies of Half Life including one that is singed by the Valve gang
				(also some hats and such).  This contest is for both Action Quake2 and Action
				half-life player models.  Each separate game's entries will be judged on
				different grounds, have different rules, and separate prizes.  if you are a
				modelor for Quake2 or Half-Life or have always wanted to try it then this is
				your opportunity to strut your stuff.  Plus if there is no better way to be
				noticed in this industry than winning a contest.  I know of multiple
				professionals who started this way, (including one who got his break fro the
				lovedoll contest).
				</p>
				<p>
				Secondly, and just as exciting, is the release of the first bot to be
				compatible with Action Quake2.  It is hard to explain and it is in beta, so I
				will just give a link and let the author tell it like it is.  Don't expect an
				eraser bot though, this is completely different stuff here.
				<a href="http://www.botepidemic.com/aid/cgf/">http://www.botepidemic.com/aid/cgf/</a>
				.  It is serendipitous if you think about it.  The bot being released so near
				an Action Player Model contest will mean that many more avatars to portray the
				bots once the contest ends.
				</p>

				The Action Spin Offs site is ready for public consumption.  If you are unaware
				of what this site represents, it is the official site for all user made mods of
				the publicly released Action Quake2 source code.  Some really cool mods have
				been made using the source and this is the place for info, downloads, etc. on
				these mods.  If you make an action mod or want to know anything about them then
				go here:
				<a href="http://aqmods.telefragged.com/">http://aqmods.telefragged.com/</a>
				.  It is a great site so far and more is developing with it right now.  I
				expect that it would help quite a bit if the mod teams themselves keep in touch
				with the webmasters of this site for everyone's (especially fans of your mods)
				good.  Large thank you to the group working on this.

				I found an extremely cool program that allows you to rip, edit, change, and
				resave images and other resources form almost any windows32 program.   I used
				it a LONG time ago to make winamp 'skins' before there was such a thing as
				winamp skins.  I recently refound it and was pleased to find he has done
				wonders with the new beta, including the ability to make stand alone .exe files
				that recreate changes.  It is only able to do that in the registered version
				but I will hopefully have a registered version soon.  I mention this here
				because I think it serves as a very unique (and rather welcome) way to edit
				many programs and give them action themes.  For example, I have been using ICQ
				since it's first month of release and I have always HATED two things about it.
				1)that annoying fog horn, which I delete every time I redownload icq and 2)
				that STUPID flower, which is worse than ever in the splash screens of today's
				versions.  So I took restorator (this program I am rambling about) and my own
				personal crosshairs for AQ2 and converted the crosshairs to the splash screen.
				Now the splash screen is bigger, but is only really thin lines so doesn't get
				in the way at all, pus it repeats the words splash screens suck over and over.
				Is that spiffy or what?!  So to make a long story short, what I want to do is
				start a new section under optionals over at the Actor's Guild and start
				accepting, making, and distributing these .exe wizards to turn programs into

				action themed programs.  Almost anything is possible.  Imagine netscape skins
				(like winamp sins for netscape), or changing the interface to a game (as long
				as the game is the right kind of .exe), shrinking, removing, or changing
				annoying splash screens, replacing an ugly program's graphics with action
				themed ones, or the buttons etc.  A fully decked out clan customized version of
				icq with the little pansy flower replaced by a sniper crosshair and the rest
				all themed in action wit your clan logo in place of the icq text on the button.
				The list is endless.  Anyways, I find the prospect extremely cool, so if you
				don't then just skip this link and ignore my ramblings. But if this interests
				you like it does me then click here...
				<a href="http://www.bome.com/Restorator/">http://www.bome.com/Restorator/</a>
				.  If you make something cool with it email me and let me know (PLEASE do not
				send me any large files, only send if you get a registered version and can make
				the self applying .exe files which are much smaller).  In other words, have
				pity on my mailbox.

				The release date of Action Half Life (public beta) is the 29th of this month.
				That is the firm date of the mod expo and thus it is also the firm date for
				AHL's release.
				</p>
				<p>
				I am not feeling well.  I have been sick for a week or so, and although I am
				getting better I am still very, very tired.  For this reason I am going to once
				again mirror the news between the AQ2 and AHL sites.  Do not let this confuse
				you, I simply need rest if I am going to get up and do anything productive at
				all.  On the plus side, whatever I have seems to be the cure for insomnia so
				maybe I can bottle it and get rich :)
				</p>
				<p>
				aqservers.telefragged.com will soon replace the servers page and will serve as
				the servers page for both mods.  Just a note to the future, look out for it.
				</p>
				<p>
				Doh, one more thing (this is added after the first post because I forgot it,
				which is why it is at the bottom).  Ace12ga is working on Action for Quake1,
				which should prove cool.  He does have permission and he has actually been
				around for quite some time so he should be fully capable of the project.  he is
				the author of the mall and cliff series of maps for those who are in the dark.
				Wish him luck.

				Oh man, I feel like shit and I don't doubt the telefragged server's are going
				to be feeling similar even with the new improved server they have set up.  I
				recommend you guys try the san jose mirror that hidden runs, who is also the
				contest sponsor, now that's a hard core fan for ya.
