<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+4>The l33t 455 Action Movie Demo Contest</FONT>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></CENTER>

<P>Well, we crazy folk here at the Ateam were feeling wild and crazy, and after suislide showed us <A HREF="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/action/kungfu.zip">this</A> demo he made, we felt that something must be done! Action Quake2 needs some cool demos, hell, its all about Action Movies, and yet we have seen no Action Movies made with it! How do you explain that? You can't, can you?

<P>Now while it is true that we are working on a movie in our spare time, directed by Vain, we want to see what you crazy girls and boys can produce. However, we're broke-ass because we've been busy working on the mod, so there will be no prize for this contest.

<P>Well, not entirely true. The winner of the contest will get MAD PROPS from us, as well as have an entire day dedicated to their l33t-455 (note: that was AOL-elite-speak for 'cool person'). We'll also like, uh, say they rock and stuff. I dunno shit, someone help us out here =P

<P>But that's not important, you guys are in it for the fun, not the money! Right? Well, damnit, I say you're in it for the glory.

<P>Here are the rules:

<OL>

<LI>The deadline for the contest is the night of Saturday, September 5th, at 12:00 Midnight.</LI>

<LI>Anyone breaking any of the rules at all gets the following punishment: "50,000 years in purgatory forced to watch the same 3 episodes of Perfect Strangers again and again." - Bartender. Also, they get barred from the contest and if we ever see you, we get to thumb our noses at you.</LI>

<LI>All demos should be sent to <A HREF="l33t455@telefragged.com">l33t455@telefragged.com</A> only, as otherwise it will waste the time of the rest of us. Bartender will be responsible for checking this, but don't worry, everyone gets to judge on the Ateam, its just we need somewhere for them to start. If you break this rule, see rule #2.</LI>

<LI>You only get 1 shot. If you send in a demo twice (like 2 versions), see rule #2.</LI>

<LI>No Ateam member can enter the contest, but we're still gonna make l33t 455 demos. But rule #2 doesn't apply to us, just in case...</LI>

<LI>Demos should:</LI>

<OL>

<LI>Be a reasonable size. There is no longer a limit, but a 10 meg demo will result in your execution, and rule #2</LI>

<LI>Be recammed with some nice dm2 editor like <A HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/keygrip">Keygrip2</A></LI>

<LI>Include new sound effects, although not necessary, will probably be better that way</LI>

<LI>Be either A. humorous, B. Stylish (John woo feeling, slo mo, etc.), or C. Both...

<LI>NOT SUCK</LI>

<LI>Punishment for the above will be 3 times rule #2

</OL>

<LI>Demos will be judged on (in order) A. Style/Humor, B. Content, C. Consistency, and D. l33tness.</LI>

</UL>
