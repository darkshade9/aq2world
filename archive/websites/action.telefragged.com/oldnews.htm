<P>"'til 6 in da mo'nin'" - Dr. Dre

<P>Ok, I was up all night coding again. I got everything I NEEDED to get

done (the criticals) done, completely. Everything will still need tweaking,

playtesting, tweaking, etc. until its right, but that's the easy part.

Also, don't ask to help playtest, all playtesting is done at a LAN here

in my house. Here's what's done:

External .ini Map rotation. w000! Just finished this, it works. I feel

all warm inside. Big thanks to <A HREF="mailto:geist@mindspring.com">Geist</A>

who wrote the <A HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/qdevels/quake2/28_1_98g.html">tutorial</A>

on <A HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/qdevels/">QDevels</A> that helped

me thru this. I used snippets of his code too, but the implementation is

quite different. The way it works is simple. You put an action.ini file

in your action directory, if you run a server. If you set "actionmaps 1",

and the file is correctly set up, it will rotate sequentially between the

maps listed in the .ini file. On the client side, when you join a server,

if they are running 'actionmaps 1', it will list the maps that the server

is rotating in the Message of the Day, so you can decide then whether to

stay or leave, based on the server's map selection.</LI>



<LI>

Dual (akimbo) Pistols: They work, they rock, etc. etc. There are issues

with ammo, hopefully I'll get some ideas from the thread on the message

board concerning it. Needs to be playtested and balanced still, of course,

but the code and model are ready...</LI>



<LI>

Colt M4 Assault Rifle: It works, it rocks, etc. etc. Need to balance it,

and I may make it shoot thru people, which would be an easy addition (thanks

to Gooseman's code)... Needs to be playtested and balanced...</LI>



<LI>

New Handcannon: Check out the screenshot. Thanks to <A HREF="mailto:elysium@fuse.net">Suislide</A>

we have a new handcannon model. This model has reload frames, which changes

the way it functions. Now, between each shot, you have to manually reload

the handcannon (pull out the shells and pop a couple in). This is a good

thing, being stuck with the handcannon reload frames in the middle of combat

without choice is a thing of the past. If you don't know what I'm talking

about, uh, it's late (early) and I don't want to explain. Look at the pretty

picture:</LI>

New grenade: Thanks to <A HREF="mailto:mjay@rmci.net">Abraxis</A>, (who

also sent in a knife model I'm soon going to implement), we have a nice

new grenade model. <A HREF="mailto:elysium@fuse.net">Suislide</A> (who

did the handcannon model) is also helping with the skin on that model,

from the early versions I've seen and implemented, its gonna rock. You

pull the pin, and the model actually pulls the pin (amazing, huh?)... Looks

like a grenade instead of a green baseball too.. which is cool...</LI>



<LI>

Better Obituary messages. I'm contemplating making these based on where

you last got hit (like a special Obit when you get killed with a headshot).</LI>



<LI>

A sprite instead of a model for the laser sight. Looks a bit better and

should help with speeds. Needs testing still tho.</LI>



<LI>

The sniper rifle is 100% accurate. w00! Still needs a bit of testing, but

I'm almost certain we got it this time =P. Still need to mess with the

'zoom out' mode. Fixing the 'zoomed out' mode will be a bitch tho. Also,

expect a surprise in the area of the sniper rifle. It will get MUCH cooler

if the implementation works...</LI>



<LI>

Dozens of tiny bugfixes and general code polishings. For example, the laser

sight only attaches to those guns that gain from them (ie, NOT the shotgun

or handcannon).</LI>



<LI>

Also, thanks to <A HREF="mailto:wangchi@cts.com">Snigglet</A>, Action Quake2

has a very sleek new 'look' (ie, the console background, icons, exit screen,

etc. etc.)</LI>

</UL>

I guess that's about it, for now. All these things coming to you in the

next version... I can't wait either...

<P>Code code code

<BR>All day long

<BR>Code code code

<BR>While I sing this song

<P>I was up too late last night.

<P>I was up all night working on the mod again, this is what I got done:

<UL>

<LI>

New grenade model put in (thanks to <A HREF="mailto:mjay@rmci.net">Abraxis</A>

who generously made us a model), and some stuff that fixed all our grenade

bugs... (w00) The new model looks cool, and the pin actually comes out

of the grenade when you pull it! The actual grenade is exactly the same

tho, but now you can carry 2, once again.</LI>



<LI>

Range modifier added to the pistol... We'll tweak and mess with it until

it's "right" Right now it kicks in 2/3 damage at 600 texels-1400 texels,

and past 1400 texels its 1/2 damage. Since the head shot does more than

"100" damage, the head shot is still fatal at 600-1400, and ALMOST fatal

at +1400. If you don't know what a texel is, the q2 guy is something like

64 texels tall.. i think.. whatever...</LI>



<LI>

Sniper rifle is now 110% accurate (+- 10%) =P.. in other words, it hits

the target every time.. based on rail gun code (we were wrong, you were

right, blargh) The other sniper stuff (zoomed out being all freaky wierd)

will be much tougher tho..</LI>



<LI>

Semi Automatic code removed, perhaps I'll mess with it later (client side),

but I think that's more trouble then its worth</LI>



<LI>

Map rotation via outside .ini file, sorta almost done (when having no back

ground in C, learning how to scan external files and arrange them into

an array is a bitch). When I'm done, there should be a random/sequential

choice, and the list of maps will be displayed in the MotD (message of

the day), so when you join a server, you can decide if you like the selection

of maps, and decide to stay or leave, or whatever.</LI>

</UL>

Map rotation is really boring to code, as tough as it is. So I may take

a break and work on something fun, like night vision (tho both Pietro and

I have tried and failed before)... may simply mess with various ideas to

make Action Quake2 visually cooler (like bleeding, a huge explosion of

blood from the sniper rifle shot, etc. etc.) This is more fun then mapping,

and I don't get bitched at when the r_speeds are thru the roof =P

<P>The #portals chat was a blast, although as Bartender said, the dumbass

quotient was a tad high. But what can you expect, it was the biggest channel

on 3dnet by far last night, we were a very full room. Got lots of good

ideas, and lots of mappers out of that one. Apparently the PORTALS team

inspired another map making team to be created and make maps for Action

Quake2, the Die Hard Mappers. So we have at least 2 teams making maps,

in addition to the countless individuals. Soon, we'll have too many maps,

if this works out. Can't wait =P

<P>My ppro200 is still in the shop several hundred miles away, so it will

probably be at least 3-5 more days. But Bartender's P100 runs q2 acceptably,

at least enough to code/bugtest..

<P>And to think, this is just day 1 of the new version. The next version

should be impressive, and be in your hands soon, at this rate.

<P>First, we really need someone who is very knowledgeable in Linux, and

has a fair amount of free time to prepare Linux ports of whatever version

we release, quickly afterward. The current v.94 Linux port of Action Quake2

has many bugs in it (Raven, who generously ported AQ2 to linux before,

also runs Telefragged, so he has little free time to fix bugs, etc.). So

if you are interested, email me.

<P>Akimbo is so cool, btw. The fri/sat before the crash, Vain, Pietro and

I were playtesting it, and although there were plenty of bugs still, it

was a blast to just riddle someone with bullets at close range.

<P>The range modifier on the pistol is pretty cool. Head shots still kill,

except at VERY VERY long ranges, they do like 85 damage before bleeding

kicks in. Everything else is effected fairly substantially, its pretty

much the way it ought to be. Well, was before the crash.

<P>I've never really had enough time to deal with the clans, but thankfully,

<A HREF="http://home.att.net/~REBEL1017/">O3</A>

has put up a very nice and professional page to deal with the incredibly

high number of clans. From now on, he will be handling all Clan related

procedings, but I will keep in contact with him about setting up tournaments,

etc. etc. The link is also on the Clans bullet on the navbar.

<P>I expect to be back up and coding/processing new stuff as of Tuesday

at the latest, but you know how these things are (like relying on 'Priority

Mail'), so we'll see what happens.

(2:15 AM CST)</FONT>

<P>Cail here. I like Bartender's format, so I'll stick with it, at least

until our page gets its makeover...

<P>First of all: <FONT SIZE=+2>Know and be warned of the wrath of CIH.</FONT>

<P>Yes. Vain and I lost our motherboards to the beast, and I permanently

lost my hard drive (BIOS doesn't even recognize it exists anymore). This

means that it put a healthy dent in our ETA on the next version. I lost

hours and hours of coding, any and every file ever sent me, anything remotely

related to Action Quake2.

<P>When the time is right, I will ask people to start resending files to

me, but PLEASE not yet. I have several hundred emails waiting for me. Unless

your email is incredibly important, I will probably not have time to respond.

Your suggestions, questions, etc. have hopefully been fielded by Bartender,

but don't expect replies for a while at least.

<P>I don't even have my motherboard back yet (its under warranty), so I'm

running off of Bartender's spare P-100. Can't play quake2, even with a

voodoo2, so I'm gonna hold off on the coding, work, etc. I will try and

get things back to normal around here.

<P>Hmmm.. I guess that's about it. Pietro is off to Germany, wish him luck!

(but not via email, since he can't answer it)

<P>I'm off to answer email, wish me luck! And, btw, Bartender is damned

right about HoP Calzones. There is litereally a 1 cm thick layer of parmasan

(sp?) on top that simply beats your taste buds into submission.

<P>Damned cool that PORTALS is gonna do action quake2 maps. I always thought

that we oughta attract some of the better mappers, simply because of the

challenge of making a level 'life-like', while still keeping it running

smooth and fun. Trust me, its difficult =P

(7:35 PM CST)</FONT>

<P>Bartender endorses 'House of Pizza' Calzones. If you are ever in San

Antonio, take a break from your heat stroke and drop by The House of Pizza

2313 N.W. Military @ Lockhill-Selma (341-1111) and get yourself a Calzone.

Yum!

<P>In unrelated news, this proclimation was nailed to the doors of the

Cathedral today...

<P>--------------

<P>We will be holding an Action Quake IRC chat on Sunday (8/2) in #portals

on 3DNet at 10 PM EST. The purpose of the chat is to discuss what the fans

would like to see in terms of new maps for the mod. The PORTALS team is

currently in the brainstorming process, so the chat will provide the best

forum for your ideas to be heard (and implemented). Do you like office

buildings? Elevators (complete with that cheesy elevator music)? Warehouses?

Garages? Let us know! Opinions about the mod itself will also be welcomed,

since anything you have to say will be useful, either to us or the Action

Quake team. Map makers are STRONGLY encouraged to attend, since I will

also be open to rounding up a few new mappers for our current Action Quake

project, not to mention that those with mapping experience will help the

flow of the discussion. How many maps we'll produce in the end is unknown

at the moment, since it all depends on participation and interest (which

is already extremely overwhelming).

<P>The Quake II community hath cometh forth and in one united voice screamed

(screameth?):

<P>"GIVE US GREAT ACTION QUAKE MAPS!"

<P>... and we plan to deliver!

<P>Spread the word guys, this mod deserves great (fast, visually pleasing,

and fun) maps. If you like Action Quake at ALL, show your support by being

at the chat. Also, as most fans know by now, two members of the AQ team

have been toasted by the CIH virus and their coder has moved to Germany,

so things are going to slow down as far as new releases go.

<P>- TiggerDawg, project manager at PORTALS (<A HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/portals/">http://www.planetquake.com/portals/</A>)

<P>---------------

<P>Many of my best agents died to bring you that post... and even more

died trying to format it. :P Anyway, we need the maps, so go!

never give you enough dressing when you get it delivered.

<BLOCKQUOTE>My people, I come to you with dire news! It has long been known

that our coder Pietro would soon be departing us and leaving for that verdant

land called Germany, and alas it has come to pass. But the greater peril

did not lie with the enemy we knew, but with the unforseen dangers that

lurked in the depths of our hard drives. For there, amidst .dll's, .exe's,

and 800 megs worth of Vain's pr0n, lurked a dangerous foe. This silent

assassain goes by the name of CIH, and he did strike down Cail and Vain

in a cowardly move. The greatest medics in the land have been working night

and day to bring back our dear departed companions.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>For you cats that don't dig my embelishment, here's the skinny...

Pietro is in Germany, Cail and Vain got smoked by a nasty MB-killer virus,

and I don't have the 'mad skillz' needed to keep working on Action Quake2.

So anything coming from us will be delayed for a while, hold off sending

us files (skins, models, ect) because we can't get to them yet and it will

just bog down our mail servers. Comments, suggestions, and dumbfuck questions

should also be held back for a while.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>The way we plan on doing maps from now on will

be server selection. Rather then have a mappak, you download all the maps

you want (the more the better), and when a server plays a map, you have

it so you can play it. (get it?). In other words, servers get to choose

map rotation, and so each server will have different types of maps. So

if your computer can't handle some of the bigger maps, play on servers

that don't run those maps.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

in general. =/</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

Mod of the Week. Go check out the article, its cool...</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>Here's the story on the semi-auto pistol. Quick

history: it was in earlier versions, and seemed a lot better. The reason,

it only used 1 frame, so you could fire it much faster. Well, the new pistol

animation uses 2 frames, which means we had to make the semi-pistol use

2 frames per shot, ie fire twice as slow. This also means that if you make

it semi-auto like we did, it makes it fire a bit slower.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>We think we may look into making it a client

side selection, something that will flip between the two choices. Or we

may simply make it default to 'autopistol 1' as in v.93, since it seems

ideas have changed. Now onto that subject, lets let you <A HREF="http://action.telefragged.com/vote/">vote</A>

again now that you've seen it:</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

into the fray =P</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>Development of Action Quake2 version .94 continues,

there's a good chance of a patch today or tomorrow. Once again this will

be server side only, so don't expect too much changes, but we already fixed:

Falling damage, the bugs, handcannon sucking, MP5 kind of sucking, etc.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>Now here's an issue that should pique some people's

interest. We have brought back Semi-automatic! As of now it's a server

side choice, they can make it automatic (like v.93) or semiautomatic (like

v.92, where each click = a shot). This makes the pistol kind of difficult

to use (you fire slower), but you conserve ammo, and are a better shot

with it..</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>Our question is, <A HREF="http://action.telefragged.com/vote/index.cgi?action=results&topic=automatic">Should

the pistol default to semi-automatic, or automatic?</A> Your <A HREF="http://action.telefragged.com/vote/">votes</A>

will probably be the kicker, but we'll see. Both choices will be in the

something inherintly unrealistic about them. One person does not kill 300

in a row with minor wounds. Same with quake2. If someone could go from

0-27 mph in .1 seconds, they'd probably pulp. For a quick primer on the

issue of quake2 un-realism, check out <A HREF="http://www.shugashack.com">sCary</A>'s

<A HREF="http://www.shugashack.com/extras/editorial2.htm">editorial</A>.

We're gonna tweak the acceleration, but there are still many things that

will be unrealistic about AQ2 (try respawning =P ).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>In short: fun comes first.. now on to the show:</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>The pistol has become too powerful, in relation

to the other weapons. Now don't worry, we're not gonna mess it up. All

we plan to do with the pistol is put a range modifier: ie, if they are

too far away, it does less damage. This would be scaleable, so its best

to be close, but even at a max range it will do no less than half damage

(maybe more). This is to promote Action fights, and make it more difficult

to snipe with the pistol (absurd and boring). This will also make the Sniper

Rifle more useful.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>The unique weapons are less powerful than the

pistol, except for certain combos, or perhaps the shotgun, they are simply

not as good. This will change, but only to a point.. We want to MAKE you

want those unique weapons, and fear death, and losing them. Here's how

we will change them:</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>The shotgun is great the way it is (perhaps a

tad more damage, as well as bug fixes (bandaging), etc. )</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>The mp5: we are going to add different fire modes

(single shot, 3rdburst), as well as make it simply better. Certainly better

accuracy, and maybe a bit more punch too.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>The handcannon: we hope to replace the model,

but if you wanted to know, its a sawed-off. It sucks right now, because

the spread is a bit too high. We have many plans to try and fix it (before

it was TOO powerful, and we overcorrected). Don't worry about it, it will

either turn out well, or we are also thinking of making it go away.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>The sniper rifle: we WILL fix it for one last

time, making it 100% accurate. We will also fix the bug where you can't

do anything while zoomed out. Finally, we should be able to add a 'hip

shot' that is innacurate, but you can shoot while zoomed out. ("sniper"

mode)..</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>A Colt M4 (assault rifle): we are going to add

Gooseman's excellent model to the lineup. We will find a way to balance

it, but yes it will be a damed good weapon, and the person who uses it

will want to stay alive and keep it. We will either recompile the maps

with the new weapon placement, or perhaps replace the handcannon with the

M4 and find some way to do ammo for it. We'll see.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>Finally, Gooseman is working on Akimbo pistols

(dual guns!). Hopefully, it will be in the next release, in addition to

his Colt M4...</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>Hmm... i think that's about it.. there is some

more stuff we will be doing, but I think this ought to satiate some of

you.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>Well, version 3.17 has been released, so go grab

it now. Guess what! It didn't mess up Action Quake2! This is a good thing

(our coder is out of town =P ). This also is good because our Linux/sparc

servers can now run the latest version (I understood that 3.15 was never

ported or something). Not sure about that, but, apparently everything is

cool... Also, they 'fixed' the physics, its now very newtonian again (you

can't change velocity in midair), which is a good thing for realism and

Action Quake2 in general...</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>Interesting, almost 90% of you so far have said

that from 4-10 is your favorite player size, with very few saying more

than that is good. Perhaps servers should limit to 9 or 10 (although most

do). Almost HALF of you said 6-7 was your idea number, so perhaps we should

ask servers to limit down to 7 (which would also reduce lag). The reason

we won't is that we don't have enough servers! Even at settings of 10-12,

they are almost always full, which is a bad thing. So if you know anyone

that has a server, and think they might dig the mod, show it to them!</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>Wow, version .93 pushed us over the 50k mark!

w00! Some people have asked us what is going to be in the next version..

here's a VERY tentative list of things planned:</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>

<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+0>Tweaking falling damage. Ok, we may sacrifice realism for

some playability here, ie, reducing falling damage a tad in some way or

another.. I have to agree, its really annoying when a slight slip up (ESPECIALLY

with quake2 v 3.15's wacked out anti-newtonian physics) kills you</FONT></LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>

<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+0>More realistic movement code. You shouldn't be able to strafe

so insanely fast while running, at least not without some kind of balance

loss or something. We've been discussing how to make this work, but it

will probably have to do with lower acceleration, but possibly higher top

speed (more realistic)</FONT></LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>

<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+0>Sniper rifle hip shots. These will be innacurate, but you

can shoot now instead of having to zoom in to 2x just to hit someone right

in front of you...</FONT></LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>

<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+0>New models? Akimbo (dual pistols) possibly, but a good chance

of new player models (male and female)...</FONT></LI>

</UL>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>

<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+0>New maps? Almost certainly, but we may wait a while (for

the map contest), so then again...</FONT></LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>We added a couple more servers already! Wow!

Now... Warning: rant below!</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>On a darker note, there is a rumor going around

that we STOLE these models from <A HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/seals">Navy

Seals 1</A>. If you scroll down, you will see that <A HREF="mailto:gooseman@telefragged.com">Gooseman</A>

joined our mod a couple weeks ago. Gooseman did the models for Navy Seals

1, so of course, the models he did for us are probably somewhat based on

those, or similar in design! We're very lucky to have him, he is very talented

(as you can obviously tell). He did some great work on Navy Seals, and

he is doing some great new stuff for us too...</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>A lot of people in the Quake community automatically

assume that every mod that is somewhat-the-slightest-bit-similar is in

some kind of fierce animal-like competition. Hell, the same thing is assumed

about software developers (id and Epic for example, are not at each other's

throats or something, they have a healthy competitive relationship, which

is to be understood, especially when vying for your dollar). Neither Navy

Seals (we assume) or us are making a cent off of this, we're doing it for

YOUR enjoyment, and its fun to work on a mod (try it sometime, it beats

just playing Q2 DM all day)... The only people that might be making money

off our or mods success is Planetquake or Telefragged respectively (through

ads), but even then, it costs a lot of money to run a big Internet Server

like that... so please, check your info before you spam servers or message

boards with rumors.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>We have no ill intentions toward ANY other mod,

least of all Navy Seals 1 or 2 (frankly, I can't wait to play Navy Seals

2.. the single player looks awesome, as in Navy Seals1! Single player is

the one obvious place where our mod lacks...). We've gotten email (well,

transitively) about other mods (which I won't name) that have bashed our

mod. I simply can't understand what would motivate people to do this (well,

I can, it's called immaturity). Of course, you're allowed not to like a

mod (many people don't of course), and to voice your opinion. Its just

when you do it in a malicous and unbased/immature way (ie, This Mod Sucks!),

that you've regressed to immaturity, something the Quake Community is trying

to clean its image of.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>Well, I hope my rant didn't bore you, I think

I openly addressed some issues that needed to be spoken about, and hope

that I've cleared some things up. I also hope that our 'relationship',

both real and perceived between the rest of the Quake Community remains

healthy and good natured. Sometimes, people forget that the entire reason

people play games is for FUN!</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+0>In other words, relax, play the mod, have some

fun, and chill out.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

been very busy, both with the mod and with Real Life, so I haven't really

had the chance =P</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First thing, the next release! After

some debate, we've decided to release v.95 (its a big jump) this weekend,

hopefully late tonight, but likely tomorrow instead. This will have all

new weapon models, a bunch of gameplay/code changes, two new levels, etc.!

BTW, the two new levels: one of them (Military Training grounds) is a dual

fort opposing thingy (you gotta see it), and the other is our old friend

(Hostage (the one with the plane)) completely redone (without the plane)

for r_speeds and software compatibility goodness, as well as two different

rooms and a crate maze (w00!). Yer gonna dig it.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of maps, Telefragged has graciously

begun an Action Quake2 Level Design Contest! The prizes are nice (1st and

get $10).. the deadline is 7 weeks, but we'll start judging as soon as

3 weeks, so get cracking, we may choose all the prizes before the deadline

is up! I'll post a link to more specific instructions as soon as its up.</FONT>

<A HREF="mailto:gooseman@telefragged.com">Gooseman</A>,

he's now a part of the Ateam. You people are gonna flip when you see these

new models in action! <A HREF="mailto:gooseman@telefragged.com">Gooseman</A>

ejection and bullets that go through people, etc. He is also doing some

new stuff for us, we can't wait!</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, check out the new layout, thanks

to the wonderful artistic skill of <A HREF="mailto:bmiche19@idt.net">Nirrad</A>!

I have also done a minor revision to the page. Expect a complete revision

to come with the next release. For now though, I have changed the <A HREF="contact.htm" target="main">Contact</A>

page, as well as the <A HREF="progress.htm" target="main">In Progress</A>

and I have added a <A HREF="suggestions.htm" target="main">Suggestions</A>

page for those who want to give us some ideas. Check that page first!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Status of the next release: We're in

the process of incorporating the new models and code from Gooseman into

Action Quake, something that sounds easier than it is. There will be some

heavy changes, mostly to reflect the new weapons, such as ammo load-outs,

etc, but gameplay will be essientialy exactly the way you like it!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ETA: There may be a semi-release this

weekend, but probably not. Most likely look for a bigger release the next

weekend, after this weekend. We're quickly approaching 1.0 status, as more

and more stuff goes into this TC (we can call it that now, btw), the better

it gets!</FONT>

teamplay in our Assassinate the Leader teamplay mode: when you die, you

stay dead for the round, and everyone starts on even ground together as

a team.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New models are coming along well,

we're getting too many offers to help out! =P Thanks a lot guys...</FONT>

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We screwed up, the <A HREF="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/action/ver92adl.zip">ver92adl.zip</A>

that was on here was b0rked, but the one that is up now works fine. It

was cycling to a map that didn't exist, so make sure if you downloaded

before THIS update that you get the new one, same link.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is <A HREF="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/action/ver92adl.zip">ver92adl.zip</A>,

the v.92a upgrade to fix the 3.15 compatibility issues (head bobbing),

as well as an annoying bug involving dropping weapons while using grenades.

Its server side only, so unless you run a server, you don't need it. BTW,

just unzip this .zip into you \action directory.</FONT></UL>

<B>Saturday - </B>May 30, 1998 - <A HREF="contact.htm" target="main">Cail</A>

(12:30 PM CST)

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, the new release (v3.15) of quake2

has introduced a minor, but very strange bug, where your quake marine seems

to be digging on some music or something (his head bobs up and down). We've

tracked it, and our working on a fix. We've also tracked that wierd bug

you may have gotten using drop weapon where it says 'can't find frame 1-255'

255 times and you can't do anything but die.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we're working on a mini-release

perhaps, but we may just wait until Assassinate the Leader comes out, we've

made significant progress on that option.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, thats about it. Go away.</FONT></UL>

<B>Thursday - </B>May 28, 1998 - <A HREF="contact.htm" target="main">Cail</A>

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Post-release update: Here is <A HREF="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/action/ver92dll.zip">ver92dll.zip</A>,

for those who just want the .dll. This is the exact same dll as the one

in actn92cl.exe, so if you already grabbed the update, don't bother. Remember

that it won't nescessarily be at all the mirrors instantly, it takes a

while to spread out, so don't email me unless its corrupt or not showing

up at even telefragged!</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything went well, it seems that

y'all like the new stuff, faster levels, etc. So now we can get back to

work on the next version. We're working on lotsa stuff, new models, new

levels, Assassinate the Leader and a more general Teamplay variant based

on a similar idea, etc. You'll see some very cool stuff from us throughout

the next few weeks! I'm probably gonna put up a 'suggestion' page, because

almost everything that is submitted to us idea wise has already been submitted!</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One issue we've been wondering over

is the issue of 'coolness' versus playability, mostly having to do with

internet lag. For example, we're messing around with the idea of shells

that fly out of the gun as you shoot, something that rocks, but causes

lag. Another thing was the breakable glass/targeted lights that some people

remember from the VERY first release, something that causes server meltdowns

and massive inet lag. One solution is to make two versions, a LAN version

and an internet version, with the LAN version being more detailed and having

cooler features, but the inet version running more efficiently, while still

being cool of course =P. Tell us what you think!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost forgot, <A HREF="http://h2g.net">Clan

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT><FONT SIZE=+2>Version .92 is

out!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is the installation plan. Purge

your current action directory, (save .cfg files or whatever of course),

and start new. We have replaced basically every file, so there is no point

to an 'update', the difference would only be a couple 100k anyway. The

new file is <A HREF="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/action/actn92cl.exe">actn92cl.EXE</A>!

This is a good thing, just run it, it will have a directory prompt, with

a default of C:\Quake2. Now use common sense, and type in the path of you

quake2 directory (not action!), it will auomatically install to an action

directory if you just type your Drive:\Quake2</FONT>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Got that?

The 3 maps and the new skins are all included in the zip, so you can check

me out or whatever you want. The rest of the stuff is in the pak0.pak.

You NEED to remove the old stuff, especially pak1.pak and any directories,

if you want this to work.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Servers, there is a new <A HREF="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/action/server.cfg">server.cfg</A>

(the only change is a starting map of office3 instead of office2). The

docs are all new, etc, check em out. Here are the changes for v.92:</FONT>

<BR>&nbsp;

<UL>

<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Sniper rifle is now 100% accurate, where you aim is where

you shoot, not off to the side.</FONT></LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Dropping the sniper rifle while using it no longer causes

"problems".</FONT></LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>The jump kick has been tweaked.&nbsp; You will no longer

be "kicked back" by stationary targets.</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Completely new HUD (thanks to <A HREF="mailto:wangchi@cts.com">Snigglet</A>).

This HUD has a more Urban/90s feel.</FONT></LI>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><B>Tuesday - </B>May 26, 1998 - <A HREF="contact.htm" target="main">Cail</A>

(3:25pm CST)

<BR>&nbsp;

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few things to announce. First of all,

we got mentioned in the <A HREF="http://www.telefragged.com/mailing_list/">Telefragged

in a Week</A>, the <A HREF="http://www.telefragged.com/mailing_list/newsletter1.shtml">first</A>

issue of Telefragged's newsletter! There's an interview with yours truly

about Action Quake and some other stuff too...</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we realize we screwed up the

actn91cl.zip, the male/female directories weren't placed in the players

directory, so you probably didn't get the skins. We are including a skin

pak with a few new skins, and all of the old skins are touched up, more

texture, better detail, etc. So it shouldn't matter, you'll see what to

do when we release 92!</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that subject, we will be releasing

v.92 soon, either tonight or tomorrow. The biggest reason its being delayed?

That kickass mall map by <A HREF="mailto:ace12ga@telefragged.com">Ace12GA</A>

is being compiled right now. If it all works out and checks out, we can

release all three new maps: Office3, Prison76, and Mall1; the official

AQ2 mappak. Office3 isn't substantially different, but Prison76 is quite

faster. Mall1 just kicks ass. There will be code changes too, that'll make

our snipers very happy indeed.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of <A HREF="mailto:ace12ga@telefragged.com">Ace12GA,</A>

after doing a badass map for us, and meanwhile working on a new pistol

model and akimbo pistols model, plus being helpful in many ways, we've

decided to ask him to join the team. We figured we had better keep someone

like that around, especially since he's so great with models! Anyways,

congrats and welcome to you!</FONT></UL>

<B>Monday - </B>May 25, 1998 - <A HREF="contact.htm" target="main">Cail</A>

(2:35am CST)

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working late tonight, we are. I made

some updates, <A HREF="progress.htm" target="main">In Progress</A>, <A HREF="about.htm" target="main">About</A>,

stuff like that. My map is done compiling, I'm gonna compile Office3 tonight

(fixes the HOM stuff, adds the shotgun back in the bar, and fixes those

damn microfissures), and so we will most likely release a mappak tomorrow.

This will require a code update, which is conveniant, because there have

been some code changes this weekend:</FONT>

<UL>

<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Sniper rifle is now ultra-accurate, it actually will hit

where the crosshair is, not off to the left or right! w00!</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>That goofy 2 grenade bug has been fixed.</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Some other bugs (like drop weapon/sniper FOV problem) fixed

too...</FONT></LI>

</UL>

<FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've decided to support software again,

its not too difficult, and a lot of you appreciate it. We're also focusing

on making levels run well for everyone, so here's the new map plan. Hijack,

although very very cool, has software 'issues' and runs poorly even with

a voodoo. So we're gonna take it out of the map cycle for now, and suggest

that servers not run it, as well as take it out of the pak. However, it

will still be available for download, for those who want to use it at their

LANs (we do!), or for whatever personal use you have for it. So the new

map rotation will be this: Office3 (the new version), then Prison76 (the

new version). We'll be adding more soon, the new levels look great!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This oughta tide you over until the

other maps come out, the Assassinate the Leader (we've made significant

progress on it this weekend), and the new models and all that...</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H2G had to take down the badass ultra

fast server, for a week or so, to upgrade it. So when its back up we should

have a 16 player limit instead of an 8, and it will be even more blazing!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll update today...</FONT>

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;</UL>

<B>Saturday - </B>May 23, 1998 - <A HREF="contact.htm" target="main">Cail</A>

(3:55pm CST)

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, my map is coming along great!

It will be out soon. Grey flashes: gone. r_speeds (for those who know about

maps) in the cell block went from 5000 to 300 (!!!!!!) Its running very

well.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have more maps on the way, don't

worry!</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two new models on the way

as well, an uzi model with a reload animation and everything (new uzi),

and a new pistol that looks amazing! Thanks to <A HREF="mailto:ace12ga@telefragged.com">Ace12GA</A>

over at <A HREF="http://tasqs.telefragged.com/">Tactical Assault Squad:

QStrike Mod</A> for the pistol model (who also happens to be doing that

sweet looking Mall map!), as well as <A HREF="mailto:frostmage@mailexcite.com">Chris,</A>

for the uzi model.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The H2G server that is ultra fast

is now only running Action Quake2, making it absurdly more faster! w00!

The new address (well, same address but different port) is </FONT><FONT SIZE=+2>207.229.26.31:27910&nbsp;

!</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of servers, there's ANOTHER

server up in Holland for all our friends in the Old World. Hope you get

better pings then to these American servers. The address is 62.108.6.103:27910&nbsp;

.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll get back to work now, master.</FONT>

<BR>&nbsp;</UL>

<B>Saturday - </B>May 23, 1998 - <A HREF="contact.htm" target="main">Pietro</A>

(3:15pm CST)

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I'd give you a quick update

to tell you what I'm going to be working on soon. I want to spend some

time working with the sniper rifle physics today (assuming we don't watch

Bulworth and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in one day - what a great weekend

for movies!) I might end up spending hours on it and make no progress whatsoever

(basically I may have to recode the quake2 bullet hitscan physics - and

I'm not sure if that's something I'm capable of) but it's worth a shot

(doh). I also will work on the double grenade bug (no - I won't tell you

how to reproduce it :P). The "drop weapon" problem with the sniper rifle

has already been fixed, and the fix will be in the next version.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those seem to be the only substantial

remaining Action Quake2 bugs - so if everything goes well Assassinate the

Leader will come next. I already have some ideas for implementation but

I don't want to start on it until we feel that Action Quake2 itself is

polished. The reason we are doing ATL before Stayin' Alive is that we really

want Action Quake2 teamplay BAD - so Stayin' Alive will have to be on the

backburner for a little while.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dunno if I'm supposed to tell

you this, but Cail's new Prison map is marvelous! He really cut down on

the brush count - and the big cell block area has been split in two. The

level really runs MUCH faster, and I feel that the two cell blocks make

the level flow much better as a deathmatch level. But I don't know when

we will be able to release it - which is probably why I wasn't supposed

to tell you this!</FONT>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><B>Wednesday - </B>May 20, 1998 - <A HREF="contact.htm" target="main">Cail</A>

(4:50pm CST)

<BR>&nbsp;

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, ok, ok. I realize that a lot of

you were unhappy with the new maps. (You can stop emailing me). Although

they look cool and all, they just don't run well on a lot of computers,

the lack of software support sucks, and they are especially bad on the

internet in terms of lag. We never really thought anything of it, they

run awesome on our LANs, and we all have voodoos and upper end computers.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be releasing new versions

of both maps, ASAP, I am going to work on it right now... The problem with

hijack and HOM effect (hall of mirrors) has been tracked, it will be smushed,

in one way or another. I intend to split the cell blocks into smaller areas,

shrink the courtyard a TAD (it runs great for the most part and for most

people), and do a couple other things like remove those bars and replace

them with steel doors.. should improve everyones framerate.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Akimbo is coming along, right now I

give it about a 60-70% chance of being in the next version! w00!!!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our skinner, Vain, got a new computer

(you don't wanna know what the old one was), so now he can work on some

more kick ass skins, and put together a skinpak!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The author of Cinema gave me the .map,

and I will edit it to make it run well with action, and place weapons more

approiately (the map was originally made for Quake2)... Should turn out

to be a blast!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other maps are coming out, don't

worry, the authors both took hiatus's (hiati? whatever), and are now able

to put some work into them, and we can't wait!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think im going to set up a poll booth

voting thingy here... issues such as what type of levels do you prefer,

do you think we should implement this, or that, etc...&nbsp; We'll see...</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We need more servers! The last few days the servers have

all been overcrowded, either full, or slowing them down from too many people

being on one server! If you know anyone who runs a quake2 server, try and

get them to help out!</FONT>

BOTH <A HREF="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/action/v8X-v91.zip">v8X-v91.zip</A>

update patch and the new maps, the maps are included in the pak0.pak that

(which works fine, for those who downloaded it. You can grab either again,

now they should both be fine.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glad everyone seemed to like the code

updates and the new maps! Prison66 runs kinda slow on a lot of computers,

sorry about this, but I decided to go with what I envisioned rather than

what would run well on slower computers. For 200Mhz w/ a voodoo and up,

it should be a real treat anyway!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A HREF="http://h2g.net">Clan Hired

Guns II</A> was kind enough to hook us up with their Ultra-fast, 14mb/sec

server again, after a fairly long downtime! Now that the server has less

running on it, it is easily the fastest Action Quake2 server, not to mention

that it is the only one up 24 hours a day, 7 days a week! Have a blast

<UL><FONT SIZE=+2><B>It's here!</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>Sorry for the

wait, but I think you will find it worth it. Ok, here's how it works. There

are now two essentiel files you can get. There's the actn91cl.zip which

includes EVERYTHING you need to get started playing, including the dll,

maps, skins, etc. Then there's the v8X-v91.zip which updates any previous

version to the latest version. This zip includes the new gamex86.dll (v91),

the pak1.pak (which includes sounds, maps, and env files).</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So, to update your current version grab <A HREF="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/action/v8X-v91.zip">v8X-v91.zip</A>.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What's new in the new version? Two new maps, Hijack and

Prison66, and lots of code changes:</FONT>

<BR>&nbsp;

<UL>

<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>The "drop weapon" command will drop your unique weapon, even

if you are using it.</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>The "sniper" command allows you to toggle whether or not

you are looking through the lens of the rifle (so you can put at your hip

and walk around, but you can't shoot. It only takes a 1/4 sec to bring

it up and fire tho).</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>The sniper rifle reloads more quickly. (substantially!)</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>The server setting "actionmaps 1" or the cmd line "+set actionmaps

1" will rotate between the three action quake maps we have so far. You

HAVE to start on office2 for this to work properly, otherwise, you'll get

mixed results.</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>The machinegun "rides up" like in singleplayer quake2.</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>The handcannon is now less powerful, but only at longer ranges.

At close range, it still obliterates them!</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Shooting while walking makes you less accurate than while

standing still, but more accurate than running.</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Shooting while crouching makes you more accurate than while

standing still.</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>The lasersight now makes you as accurate as you would be

if you were crouching no matter what you are doing.</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Jumping into someone kicks them (a jumpkick)- it does 20

damage, knocks the target back pretty darn far, and disarms the person

(forces him to drop his unique weapon). This sounds unbalanced, but just

try and jump kick an armed opponent (it ain't easy =P )</FONT></LI>

</UL>



<P>&nbsp;

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hope you guys like it!</FONT>

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>I'm getting sick of this, but unfortunately as most of

you have noticed, there was no release Saturday night. There WILL be a

release today, this afternoon, we swear it. We're bugtesting it right now.

There will be two parts, a gamex86.dll (server update, but clients should

get it too), and a pak1.pak, an addendum to your current pak0.pak. This

release tonight, and if its worth it or to just wait til tomorrow or whatever

works out. It seems you people prefer to be 'bogged down' with releases,

no matter how frivolous, as long as it does something, instead of waiting

for a 'big' release, so we'll cater to you (its kinda easier for us that

way anyway). So instead of waiting for a big oppurnity to release a big,

say, client pak, we'll just release it as it comes (or in medium sized

lumps =P )</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, just check back later

tonight for a release of some kind, there's a good chance, but no guarantee.</FONT>

<B>Wednesday - </B>May 13, 1998 - <A HREF="contact.htm" target="main">Cail</A>

(10:00pm CST)

<BR>&nbsp;

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>BIG UPDATE!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok. Here's the deal. This week has

been VERY busy for the Action Quake team. Bartender's been out of town

and a way from a computer for a month now. The rest of us have been very

busy with end of the spring semester stuff. However, we try and find time

for this, we swear! During summer, we will have much, much more free time,

and this mod will be able to meet all the goals we (and you guys) have

set for it.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's the deal with the next release.

Only 2 of the new maps are completely finished. We would like to release

those maps, but there are issues. First of all, there is no way to do map

'cycling' without code. It's apparently quite complicated, and we're working

on it.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's one more issue I hate to deal

with. Some of these maps are simply not very compatible with non-voodoo.

GET A VOODOO! They are cheap now with the release of voodoo2, sell your

soul, your dog, your sister, whatever! We are not making the game unpalatable

for non-voodoo users, but for example, on my new map, there are some areas

where you will get gray flashes and not be able to see some doors (like

in office2), because of the complexity and the nature of the real world

(big open, complex, spaces). It will run great on a voodoo, and should

be smooth on non-voodoo, but won't be perfect.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't worry, we're not abandoning you

non-voodoo types. We're just pre-empting some complaints we expect. It's

difficult to please the majority (voodoo users) without displeasing the

non-voodoo's. Maybe now you'll have that excuse to go out and buy one already!

=P</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now on to the next release. I know

a lot of you have emailed us telling us you can't wait for the next release.

First of all, NOT ALL the code we put in the <A HREF="progress.htm" target="main">'in

progress</A>' is done! The things that ARE currently completed are:</FONT>

<BR>&nbsp;

<UL>

<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Difference in accuracy based on speed. I.e.: Crouching is

ultra-accurate, standing still is standard accuracy, walking is fairly

inaccurate, and running is very inaccurate. This is only true with bullet

weapons, but not with the sniper rifle or shotgun/handcannon.</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>A jump kick. It is automatic, not a weapon you switch to

(so it works with any weapon). If you are in the air and aimed at an enemy,

you kick them. They FLY (easily out a window), and take 10-20 damage. In

addition, we will make it have a 50% chance (or so) of disarming their

'special weapon' so that you can pick it up and use it on them. Eventually,

it will also disarm the pistol. This all seems a bit extreme, but it is

VERY difficult to get a jump kick off, especially when they have a gun,

for obvious reasons..</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>The laser sight is amazing now. Although it still has the

disadvantage of giving away your location, it makes you shoot as accurately

as if you were crouching, no matter your speed. You can be running toward

someone, and will have better accuracy than someone who is standing still.

People don't seem to realize that this is ARTIFICIAL accuracy. The 'cone'

of your bullet spray is adversely effected by your moving; no matter where

you aim, you will not necessarily hit that one spot. With the laser sight,

you will, or at least come much closer to that spot. This ROCKS!</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>The sniper rifle's shot time is down from about 5 secs to

2 secs. This more than doubles the firing rate. Don't worry, more is on

the way to make the sniper rifle THE weapon to have for long distance killing.

Future changes should include a grappling hook, a 'down' position so you

can quickly bring the rifle up rather than taking 7 secs to switch to it...</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Some other little stuff (bug fixes)</FONT></LI>

</UL>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Instead of releasing this tonight as we probably could (with

LOTS of work), we are instead going to work on this a LOT this weekend.

We realize that we don't have Assassinate the Leader, map cycling, or Stayin'

alive in yet, and we would feel like we're cheating you guys if we didn't

release that stuff too. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT STUFF WILL BE IN! However,

we are trying, this is not easy. Some of the simpler stuff (like gunlights)

are a strong possibility however. It takes a lot of work to do this kinda

stuff. We also want to release all the maps together, for logistical reasons,

and so the servers work right.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Also, I intend to do a lot more model work, and you will

see some nice changes to some stuff coming soon, possibly something this

weekend.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Conclusion: We WILL ABSOLUTELY, WE SWEAR release something

this weekend, no matter what. We would like to release something Friday

night, then something else Saturday night, since we are going to completely

give up a weekend to make you guys happy =P</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It will be worth it in the end, we promise. Sorry once

again (we know), but this time we swear that this weekend, possibly Friday,

but I would bet on Saturday night, release a new version and at least some

maps.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Thanks...</FONT>

<B>Sunday - </B>May 10, 1998 - <A HREF="contact.htm" target="main">Cail</A>

(10:20pm CST)

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we hit a few snags on the version

release. We're sorry, we shoulda put 'When it's done.' (TM) on the page

instead. However, it WILL be done (as much as can be finished) early this

week. The maps are taking a while, but every extra hour we mapmakers put

into our levels counts! I'm polishing up the details, and compiling tonight

or tomorrow night on my map. We have one fully completed map ready, and

the others are on the way. We plan on releasing as many maps as we can

wednesday, and then all of them together when we're done. The problem is

that codes is required to cycle the maps properly, so we'll have to wait

for that. This week, we PROMISE.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry for all the fans out there,

we wanna play these maps too, so it'll be out ASAP.</FONT></UL>

<B>Friday - </B>May 8, 1998 - <A HREF="contact.htm" target="main">Cail</A>

(5:20pm CST)

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, we're going to try and finish

the next version of Action Quake.. this should both be a server update

and a compilation of maps.. Either the map pak will be delayed, or we won't

include all of the maps the first time around.. It looks as if we may have

to wait until next week for all of them, but hopefully most will be finished

by tomorrow. The version release is either tonight or tomorrow, but prolly

tomorrow so we can work on it this weekend at a LAN or something...</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fixed the download page, yes it said

v.86/87 when it should be v.89/89.. sorry..</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep the suggestions coming, we're

including a lot of your suggestions for the mod...</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I truncated the current news and added

an <A HREF="oldnews.htm" target="main">Old News</A> section so you don't

have to wait for that junk to load.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that's about it for now, look

for a new version/update or so this weekend!</FONT></UL>

<B>Thursday - </B>April 30, 1998 - <A HREF="contact.htm" target="main">Cail</A>

(10:50pm CST)

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No code update this weekend =(. Pietro

had to go out of town, and although there is lots of new stuff implemented

(such as the jump kick, walking vs. running accuracy, etc. ), you'll just

have to wait until next weekend! Hopefully, all the <A HREF="maps.htm" target="main">maps</A>

will be done by then, and we can release a map pak with the code!</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other news, thanks to a great idea

by a fan, we have completely revamped the '<A HREF="scoring.htm" target="main">Stayin

Alive</A>' system of scoring, into a MUCH simpler version. Go check it

out.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guy who is doing that really cool

looking Mall map for us is also doing some modeling! We should have an

all new pistol model (that actually looks like a pistol instead of an uzi)

fairly soon. But best of all, we get akimbo (two guns in two hands at the

same time)!!! All you Chow Yun Fat fans rejoice!!!</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry you guys have to wait, but it

will all be worth it. This mod will get at least twice as good in the next

two weeks with the maps, skins, and design changes in store!</FONT></UL>

<B>Sunday - </B>April 26, 1998 - <A HREF="contact.htm" target="main">Cail</A>

(9:30pm CST)

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In case you hadn't noticed, we hit

10,000 on our counter! Thanks a lot to all our dedicated fans out there

who have made this mod into something much greater than what it was a month

ago!</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've updated the <A HREF="maps.htm" target="main">Maps</A>

section of the page with screenshots of the 5 upcoming maps we are going

to include in the next map pak (1-2 weeks tops). These maps are looking

incredible, and it will be nice to have servers running a cycle of specifically

designed maps instead of the q2dmX maps or office2 over and over..</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of office2, for some reason,

the new version of <A HREF="www.qoole.com">Qoole</A> fixes those damn microfissures

so prevalent in my level! I am thinking of doing a final revision of office2

(office3), that will fix those, fix the fact that i left out the regular

shotgun (DOH!), fix some funky errors in the garage, and perhaps add some

detail to certain sections of the map, if i find time... This WILL be the

last update to that map, and shouldn't be much of a hassle because I simply

plan to release it with the rest of the mappak.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The skinpak is also nearing completion,

and hopefully we will be releasing both at the same time.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of the features in the <A HREF="progress.htm" target="main">In

Progress</A> section are completed in code, and are being tweaked and adjusted

by <A HREF="mailto:kovner@world-net">Pietro</A> as we speak (unless he's

playing starcraft =P)..</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expect some kind of update this weekend,

and possibly a whole new client pak in the near future!</FONT></UL>

<B>Friday - </B>April 24, 1998 - <A HREF="contact.htm" target="main">Cail</A>

(11:50am CST)

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>A mapmaker/fan who's making a damn cool looking map for

us sent us a <A HREF="ftp://ftp.telefragged.com/pub/action/action.def">Action.def</A>

(entity file for QERadiant), so grab it if that's yer program of choice.

(You may have to shift-click it to download, or use "save as")</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We're still working on the next release,

should include a lot of what we're working on, but we're kind of hesitant

to release a whole new client PAK, with new sounds, etc. So, we'll see

how that goes..</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MAP PAK is coming along (I know

how everyone hates playing q2dmX maps with action, but playing office2.bsp

over and over gets boring too).. This will include at least 3-5 maps, in

addition to office2, plenty to cycle through...</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The skin pak will hopefully be released

along with the mappak.. we'll see...</FONT></UL>

<B>Wednesday - </B>April 22, 1998 - <A HREF="contact.htm" target="main">Cail</A>

(7:10am CST)

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>Well, in preparation for the next big release, and winding

toward a v1.0, we are changing the format of the page concerning future

changes. Instead of the cryptic and dated 'coming soon' section, there

are now 3 new sections of the page, the <A HREF="progress.htm" target="main">In

Progress</A> section which outlines what everyone is working on and what

priority it has. You can check back there, we will update you when things

have been achieved or have failed for now, and will not be pursued.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also added two Rules sections:

<A HREF="scoring.htm" target="main">Stayin'

Alive</A>, the new bonus scoring system that rewards you for doing just

that.. This is an Action Movie, something where the stars tend to not sacrifice

lifes for just a few kills...</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other section is <A HREF="assassinate.htm" target="main">Assassinate

the Leader</A>. Our ideas about Capture the Briefcase have changed, it's

been done to death. Go check out both of these 'coming soon' changes that

will significantly alter both the current DM version of Action Quake2 and

the coming Teamplay version.</FONT></UL>

causing them to die from fall damage, the attacker recieves a frag and

holding us down (the Man, Real Life, playing the mod, playing Starcraft,

etc.) I'll be out of town for a few days, but when I get back we're gonna

release the new server side code (fixes some exploits, perhaps adds some

features such as a jump-kick, etc. ) before I get back.. Perhaps not.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Bandaging is now independent of reloading (ie you shouldnt

be healed when you reload the shotgun)</FONT></LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>There is also a <A HREF="ftp://ftp.telefragged.com/pub/action/server.cfg">server.cfg</A>

up on <A HREF="../down.htm" target="main">Downloads</A> if you run a map.

Of course, this is just a suggestion, model it to how you'd like, but it

helps those who haven't run a server before...</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>The bugfixing is going very well... About 95% f the bugs

were caused by the handcannon (aka, 'howitzer') having 100(!!!) pellets

that each did a small amount of damage. Now it has less, but does more

damage (but is still ultra-spread-like and powerful at close range). Other

bugs, such as lava not hurting if yer bleeding, or too much fall damage

are also fixed. <B>Expect a v .85 release late tonight or sometime tomorrow.</B></FONT>

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>We have had SO many requests for akimbo, it's unbelieveable.

We've wanted to do it very badly, but I'm an amateur modeler (if you didn't

notice, all the weapons are derivatives (well, very different) from the

original weapons.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If you can model, we'd really, really, really appreciate

it if you could animate the pistol we have now into two, akimbo pistols,

(ie. fires right, then left, then right, then left) when ever you fire

it. If no one knows how to do it, or can't animate, i'll do it, but it'll

take me a long time =(.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We've had some people say they want to contribute to the

mod, well, here's yer chance!</FONT>

feedback we've recieved about the mod today! I'm happy to announce that

none of the bugs will stop play - even though they might be a pain in the

can't find that kevlar vest, keep your shirt on until the next release

either today or tommorow.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Thanks to clan tdc for setting up our first server - without

you, we wouldn't have gotten to PLAY the mod on the internet, and thanks

(8:00am CST)

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>Ok, things have calmed down here a bit... I've put up

three more sections to this page, <A HREF="../servers.htm" target="main">Servers</A>,

<A HREF="../helpout.htm" target="main">Help

out</A> and <A HREF="../bugs.htm" target="main">Bug List</A>... There are

only 2 servers on the server list right now, and one of them is having

IP problems until Monday, so send those servers in! Expect a Gamespy tab

sometime this weekend, as well as server config files (we'll have 2, one

that goes through all the maps, and one that goes through those we think

are the best for this mod).</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We know there are some bugs, but don't know all of them.

Check the Bug List page to see if yours is on there before sending it in,

and please do send it in if it's not. We will be working out a bugfix plan,

probably a new gamex86.dll once a day for a while, if we can, but then

we'll slow down...</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For this first week or so, you may have to check back

here often to make sure there is no bugfixes, but only if you are a server,

these bugs pertain to server side only...</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The 'Help out' section is because already people have

discussed helping out, doing maps, etc. Currently there is an <A HREF="ftp://ftp.telefragged.com/pub/action/action.ent">action.ent</A>

file (works with <A HREF="../www.qoole.com">Qoole,</A> not sure about other

programs). If it isn't working with yours, give me an email and I'll just

put up an entity list and you can make your own... If you want to do skins,

something with a modern feel, like a certain movie, or just a person in

'normal' clothes (ie, not future-tech stuff with lights on it), then send

it on in! We'll put up 'external stuff' both on our ftp site and in our

next patch, as long as it's quality.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We were suprised by the support we have already recieved

in the first day, many offers for servers that are in the process of being

set up, many props, many suggestions. Keep 'em coming, we can use them

to make this mod better for you!</FONT>

out mirror at <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/quake/telefragged/action/">ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/quake/telefragged/action/</A></FONT></FONT>

those who have sent in comments to us, we appreciate any and all feedback

(that means you!). We will certainly be releasing tomorrow evening, and

will have a link on this page to the ftp site. We will probably have an

irc channel up to discuss the mod with people (check here tomorrow to see

where), and to meet up to play some Action Quake<SUP>2</SUP> (the only

thing we enjoy more then making this mod is 'play-testing' it.. =)</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We will be setting up a list of Action Quake<SUP>2</SUP>

servers on this web page (look for a link here and on the navbar soon)

as soon as we release. The server code will be seperate, you don't need

the pak0.pak file (just the gamex86.dll), so if you run a dedicated server

or will be able to, we would really appreciate your support. We know it's

hard to get the ball rolling on a Quake2 Mod, to get deathmatch servers

up, etc, so anyone who has a dedicated server they could set up, just email

me, </FONT><A HREF="mailto:cail@telefragged.com">Cail</A><FONT SIZE=+1>,

and I'll put your address up on the server list page. If you know ahead

of time that you want to run an Action Quake<SUP>2</SUP> server, email

me now and I'll update you immidiately (via ICQ or email) when it's ready,

the Sniper Rifle..</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Grenades don't explode when you die, but as a last breath

move, you chunk that grenade you were holding...</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>New skins and models for weapons and runes</FONT></LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Removed the medkit and added a silencer, very quiet noise,

no muzzle flash, it's evil...</FONT></LI>

on Friday, April 3rd, 1998. We are basically done with this release, although

we will probably try and add VWep support (visible weapons), if time permits.

All that is left is some graphical changes, a lot of Quality Assurance

(QA) work, and whatever else we can get in by Friday.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, we will be moving to action.telefragged.com
