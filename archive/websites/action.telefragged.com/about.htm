<p align="center"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ever seen a great action movie
and thought to yourself:</font></b> </p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Sometimes I wish Quake2
was more like this!&quot;</font></b> </p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, so have we, and we did
something about it... &nbsp;</font></b> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Idea:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We wanted to try and make a Quake2 MOD where
strategy, accuracy, and just damn cool looking fights dominate.
We tried it, and it's the most fun we've ever had in a DM game,
we think you'll feel the same way when you try it.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The idea is that each bullet counts for a lot,
but that doesn't mean you shouldn't pump them full of as many
bullets as you can spare; they'll get a chance to shoot back
before they die if you don't finish them off. Cover actually
means something, it's better to make sure there's a pillar or a
desk near by to duck behind, especially if you have to reload or
bandage yourself.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once in a while it's nice to get away from the
rocket launcher/bfg fights, and see what it's like to fly up from
behind the bar with a shotgun, or to drop behind your enemy
through a skylight, executing them with one bullet. Plus, you
look damn smooth while you're doing it! &nbsp;</font>
</p>
