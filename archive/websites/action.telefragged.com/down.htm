<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Before you download Action Quake2, you may want
to read about it in our <a HREF="about.htm">About Action Quake2</a> section.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Action Quake2 is multiplayer only.</font></p>

<p><b><u><font size="3" face="Verdana" color="#FFC002">Step one:</font></u><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#808080"><br>
</font></font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Prepare your computer for Action Quake2. First of
all, make sure you have Quake2 installed properly, and that you
have updated Quake2 to the latest version, 3.20. You may need to update your
Quake2 version (not your Action Quake2). If you have never
upgraded Quake2 or it is earlier than 3.12, you can grab the <a
href="ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/q2-3.20-x86-full.exe">full
upgrade</a>. If you have version 3.12-3.15, you can grab a <a
href="ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/q2-3.20-x86.exe">smaller
update</a>. If the servers are running a newer version of Quake2 than what
 is here then you will need to upgrade to whatever version they are running.
  Quake2 insists that servers be the same version as the people who play on them.
If you have never played Quake2 multiplayer before, you are in for a treat!
 However, jumping headfirst into a mod may be more difficult than you expected.
 It shouldn't be, but you have been warned! =P</font> </p>



<p><b><u><font size="3" face="Verdana" color="#FFC002">Step two:</font></u><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#808080"><br>
  </font></font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Download the latest Action Quake2 
  client version, v1.0c. Choose either the <a
href="http://www.magicman.org/actionq2/actn1Ccl.exe">actn1Ccl.exe</a> installer 
  (8.8 megs) or an ol' fashioned zip <a
href="http://www.magicman.org/actionq2/actn1Ccl.zip">actn1Ccl.zip</a> (8.8 megs). 
  If you choose to download the .zip (not recommended, but might be needed for 
  some), realize that you need a zipper that supports long file names. Try <a
href="http://www.winzip.com">WinZIP</a>. While you are waiting for it to download, 
  check out step three.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You will also need to download and install these two files that fix small problems with vwep:<br>
  <a href="http://www.magicman.org/actionq2/1cCLfix.exe">1cCLfix.exe</a><br>
  <a href="http://www.magicman.org/actionq2/vwepfix.exe">vwepfix.exe</a><br>

As always, the EXE files are recommended, but here are the zip version in case you need them
 for some reason:<br>
  <a href="http://www.magicman.org/actionq2/1cCLfix.zip">1cCLfix.zip</a><br>
  <a href="http://www.magicman.org/actionq2/vwepfix.zip">vwepfix.zip</a><br>
  </font></p><font size="2" face="Verdana">

<p>You will also need to download the latest model/skin packs.  You can
get these at the <a href="http://guild.action-web.net">Actor's Guild</a> in the
Downloads section.</p>

</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you want to run a server, check out our <a HREF="ports.htm">server files page</a> for the very latest server binaries.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">MAPS!!!  Of course you need maps.  That is where the
<a HREF="http://aqmd.telefragged.com/" target="_blank">map depot</a>
 comes in handy.  Click <a HREF="http://aqmd.telefragged.com/">Here</a> to get all the maps you could need.</font></p>

<p><b><u><font size="3" face="Verdana" color="#FFC002">Step three:</font></u></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
While you are downloading, you should read the <a
href="http://action.telefragged.com/docs.zip">docs</a>! You
should also set up an Action Quake2 config file, if you have
never done so before. Instructions on config files can be found
at <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/bootcamp" target="_blank">The Newbie
Bootcamp </a>(it was temporarily down last time I checked)
 Also check out the configexamples.zip included in
the docs.zip! You will want to make one specific to your tastes,
and with the new Action Quake2 keys bound in it.</font></p>


<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you know how to make a config file, or bind keys, here are
the keys you HAVE to bind (you should still check out the 
configexamples.zip for a ton of cool examples of stuff like sniper
 aliases):</font> </p>


<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">opendoor - It opens doors for you.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">bandage - Bandages your wounds. Your gun goes down for 6
        seconds. After 3 seconds of bandaging, you will stop
        bleeding.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">reload - Discharges current clip and loads a new one.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">drop item - Drops your current special item, if you have
        one.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">drop weapon - Drops your unique weapon, if you have one.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">weapon - Changes mode of your current weapon, if
        applicable. For the sniper rifle, this counts as 'zoom'.
        For the pistol, it switches between semiautomatic and
        automatic.  For the knife, it switches between slashing and throwing.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You also may want to bind keys to use specific weapons:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here are the equivalents from Quake2:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Button # :</font> </p>
<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. 'use blaster' is the same as 'use Mark 23 Pistol'</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. 'use shotgun' is the same as 'use M3 Super90 Assault
        Shotgun'</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. 'use sshotgun' is the same as 'use MP5/10
      Submachinegun'</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. 'use machinegun' is the same as 'use
      Handcannon'</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. 'use chaingun' is the same as 'use Sniper Rifle'</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. 'use grenade launcher' is the same as 'use M4 Assault
        Rifle'</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. 'use railgun' is the same as 'use A 2nd Pistol' (akimbo
    pistols)</font>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. 'use BFG10k' is the same as 'use Combat Knife'</font>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Inotherwords, you don't have to rebind anything for the
weapons if you don't want to, just remember the equivalences.</font> </p>

<p><b><u><font size="3" face="Verdana" color="#FFC002">Step four:</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#808080"><br>
</font></font></u></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hopefully you have finished downloading it by now.
Before you install, make sure that you have cleaned out your old
Action Quake2 directory, if you had one before. Delete it, but be
sure to back up any personal files (like config files for
example). Now, if you downloaded the installer, simply run it. It
will ask for your quake2\action directory. For example, if Quake2
is installed to your X: drive, type X:\Quake2\action in the
prompt (that's the default). If you downloaded the zipfile, unzip
it, into your X:\Quake2\action directory. The subdirectory
information is stored, and it will be properly set up.</font> </p>

<p><b><u><font size="3" face="Verdana" color="#FFC002">Step five:</font></u></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
  Find a server! This is a multiplayer only mod, so grab this <a href="http://www.magicman.org/actionq2/aq2GStab.zip">GameSpy 
  tab</a>, and fire up GameSpy. If you don't know what GameSpy is, <a
href="http://www.gamespy3d.com">check it out</a>!</font> </p>

<p><b><u><font size="3" face="Verdana" color="#FFC002">Step six:</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#808080"><br>
</font></font></u></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Have a blast! Empty a clip into your archenemy for
me!</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good luck! If you have any questions, problems, 
  we suggest you try our <a href="http://viper.aq2zone.com/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro" target="_blank">message
