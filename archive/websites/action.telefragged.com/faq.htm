<i>Cap'n Swoosh says: This here FAQ was commissioned by Admiral's Bartender
and Suislide, who obviously have a keen eye for them whats got experience.&nbsp;
For the purposes of the FAQ, I'm allowing some land lubber to be answerin
the technical portion of the questions; but as what there is no man alive
who knows more about swashbucklin than yours truly, I'll be jumpin in from
time to time with suggestions and comments as the sittyation warrants.&nbsp;
So the long and short of it is, if you come sniffin for a place to learn
the know how that I and many other seasoned pirates got about killin and
what not, you come to the right spot.&nbsp; Now, on to the questions.</i></h4>

<p><font size=+1>1)&nbsp;<a NAME="Head shot"></a><i>I died from a single
shot!</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You were just shot in the head.&nbsp; Action
Quake is based more on "reality" than your average mod.&nbsp; Anyone can
be lethal with some skill and some luck, no matter what weapon or how much
health they have.</h4>

<h4>
<i>Cap'n Swoosh says:&nbsp; Keep yer fool head down whenever possible,
swabbie.&nbsp; These here are bullets headed for you and mighty fast.&nbsp;
One shot to yer noggin and its a deep swim to Davy Jones.</i></h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>2)&nbsp;<a NAME="Carry special"></a><i>Can I carry more than
one special weapon or item at a time?</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone starts out with a pistol and a
knife.&nbsp; A player may also carry one special weapon and one special
item.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an exception: you may carry one additional special
weapon if you are wearing a bandolier as your special item.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In rare cases, a&nbsp; server op may have tweaked something to allow players
to carry more than the standard, but this is rare.</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>3)&nbsp;<a NAME="irvision"></a><i>What's this IRvision I keep
hearing about?</i></font>
<br><i><font size=+1></font></i>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp; This is another unique feature of the bandolier, a special
item.&nbsp; Bind a key to "irvision" and as long as you are wearing a bandolier,
all bodies will appear red, no matter how deep in shadow they may be.&nbsp;
Dead bodies glow just as brightly as live bodies, so pay close attention
to posture before you start shooting.</h4>
<i><font size=+1></font></i>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<i><font size=+1></font></i>
<p><font size=+1>4)&nbsp;<a NAME="Drop special"></a><i>I don't want my special
weapon or item anymore.&nbsp; How can I pick up another?</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bind one key to 'drop item,' and another to 'drop
weapon.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Pressing one of these will toss your current special
weapon or item away, freeing up your slot to scavenge anything you find
on the ground.</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>5)&nbsp;<a NAME="Zoom"></a><i>How do I zoom in with the sniper
rifle?</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bind a key to 'weapon.'&nbsp; Pressing that key
will cycle through three zoom factors (2x, 4x, and 6x,) then back to normal.&nbsp;
Old versions of Action Quake used the 'lens' command to zoom in, but it
was changed to "weapon," with version 95.</h4>

<h4>
<i>Cap'n Swoosh says:&nbsp; Whoever thought of affixing a telescope to
thier musket were a genius, and can be me first mate on any voyage.</i></h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>6)&nbsp;<a NAME="Knife toss"></a><i>How do I throw the knife?</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bind a key to 'weapon.'&nbsp; Pressing that key
will prepare the knife to be thrown.&nbsp; Fire at will.</h4>

<h4>
<i>Cap'n Swoosh says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aim true, swabs, as there is no
weapon more difficult to kill with. And to a pirate's heart, none more
satifsying.&nbsp; Arrr!</i></h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>7)&nbsp;<a NAME="Grapple"></a><i>What is the grappling hook
command?</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no grappling hook.</h4>

<h4>
<i>Cap'n Swoosh says:&nbsp; This ain't no land lubbin lithium, lad!&nbsp;
There be no hooks here what aren't attached to a maties arm in place of
a hand..</i></h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>8)&nbsp;<a NAME="Reload"></a><i>My gun is empty!&nbsp;
How do I reload?</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bind a key to 'reload.'&nbsp;&nbsp; The shotgun
and the sniper rifle reload one shell at a time.&nbsp; The machine guns
and the pistol reload one clip at a time.&nbsp; The handcannon reloads
one <i>shot</i> at a time.</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>9)&nbsp;<a NAME="Accuracy"></a><i>I can't seem to kill
anybody, let alone hit them.</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your accuracy while firing a gun is directly
related to your speed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shots fired will be most off the mark
if you are running as you shoot.&nbsp;&nbsp; The shots get more accurate
the slower you move.&nbsp; In other words, if you want to be accurate,
HOLD STILL!&nbsp; If you can crouch, your accuracy is at its best.&nbsp;
Of course, holding still makes you easier to hit, but that is the trade
off... you can't get something for nothing!&nbsp; Just remember, one shot
to the head will kill, so precision counts.</h4>
&nbsp;
<h4>
<i>Cap'n Swoosh says:&nbsp; Arrr... lad, if ye can't kill a man maybe ye
ought to just stay ashore then.&nbsp; These here seas can be rough, and
she requires rough men to sail upon her.</i></h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>10)&nbsp;<a NAME="Doors"></a><i>How do I open doors?</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bind a key to 'opendoor.'&nbsp; Then when you
are near a door, press that key.&nbsp; This command also closes a door
that is already open.</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>11)&nbsp;<a NAME="Bandage"></a><i>Why won't I stop losing
health?</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You've been wounded in battle and are bleeding
to death.&nbsp; Quick! bind a key to 'bandage.'&nbsp; Use it whenever you
get shot, or your health will slowly drain away.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; You
can't shoot or reload while bandaging, so try to find someplace out of
the way.</h4>

<h4>
<i>Cap'n Swoosh says:&nbsp; By the powers, lad!&nbsp; Out at sea the ship's
doc can't always be on hand.&nbsp; Any man who calls hisself a pirate better
know a thing about fixin up wounds, or he ain't a pirate for long.</i></h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>12)&nbsp;<a NAME="Falling"></a><i>Help!&nbsp; I've fallen
and I can't get up!&nbsp; (or, Why did I take so much damage from that
fall?</i>)</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like we said, this mod is based more on "reality"
than most.&nbsp; You can jump down two crates worth, or about twice your
height, and not get hurt.&nbsp; More than that and it will be painful.&nbsp;
Very.</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>13)&nbsp;<a NAME="Limp"></a><i>What's with the limp?</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You've either been shot in the legs, or you've
taken damage from a fall.&nbsp; Either way, you must bandage yourself to
stop the limp.</h4>

<h4>
<i>Cap'n Swoosh says:&nbsp;&nbsp; In my case, I limp because of me peg
leg.&nbsp; And I won't be hearin no sass out of you on that account neither,
swab.&nbsp; I'll run you through soon as look at you, peg leg or no.</i></h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>14)&nbsp;<a NAME="Team start"></a> <i>I've just joined
a teamplay server, how do I start playing?</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp; Pick a team and wait until the next round.&nbsp; As soon
as one team eliminates the other, a new round will start and you will get
to play.&nbsp; Recommendation: join the team with fewer players.&nbsp;
If teams are tied for players, choose the team with fewer points.</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<P><font size=+1>15)&nbsp;<a NAME="Missing skins"></a> <i>I've just joined
this team server, but everyone looks the same!&nbsp; What is this all about?</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp; The server uses "non-official" models and/or skins; ie, they
weren't included in the official client pak.&nbsp; If Quake can't find
the skin or model requested by the server, it uses the default model/skin,
which for Action Quake is the "resdog" skin.&nbsp; You know, the guy in
the black suit and sunglasses.&nbsp; What you need to do is get the models/skins
that the server uses.&nbsp; The easiest way to do that is to turn on the
"auto-download" feature included with Quake2.&nbsp; Go to your multiplayer
menu and choose 'player setup.'&nbsp; At the bottom of the list, you'll
see a line that says "download options."&nbsp; Go there and change every
option you see to "YES,"&nbsp; then reconnect to the server.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now you will begin downloading the models/skins that you need directly
from the server.&nbsp; It can take a long time if you have a pokey phone
modem like me, so be prepared for a wait.&nbsp; Don't worry about unzipping
or anything like that, because the server puts everything into the proper
place on your hard drive.&nbsp; Once its all downloaded, the game starts
as normal and you may frag at will.</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>16)&nbsp;<a NAME="Wrong Team"></a><i>Oops! I picked
the wrong team and I want to switch.&nbsp; How do I do this?</i></font>
<br>
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp; Pull down your console (usually with the ~ key) and type
team 1 or team 2, depending.&nbsp; You can also type the name of the team
you want to join in place of the number.&nbsp; For example, typing 'team
swashbucklers' will switch you to the Swashbucklers team.</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>17)&nbsp;<a NAME="aq2seal"></a><i>How do I start a server?</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp; The easy way is to use AQ2 Seal.&nbsp; Link provided <a href="http://www.futuresights.com/~angstrom/aq2seal/">here</a>.&nbsp;
The hard way is to figure out all the server commands and DM flags, and
that is beyond the scope of this FAQ.</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>18)&nbsp;<a NAME="LAN"></a><i>Will AQ2Seal work with a LAN?</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer: Yes.</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>19)&nbsp;<a NAME="AQ2mods"></a><i>What's the deal with all these
other AQ2 mods, like AQ2: Gangsters, and AQ2:CTB?</i></font>
<br><font size=+1></font>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp; Early in 1999, the source code for AQ2 was made public.&nbsp;
The various AQ2 mods you see referred to around the net are the result
of dedicated AQ2ers taking the source code and making additions and/or
changes to it, then releasing it under a new name.&nbsp; Note: while these
"community" coders have produced some incredibly fun AQ2 mods, none of
them are as yet "officially supported."&nbsp; Which means that the A-Team
is not able to provide any tech support or answer your questions; you must
go to the coder of the particular AQ2 mod you have questions about.</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>20)&nbsp;<a NAME="bots"></a><i>Bots bots bots!  What about bots?</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:  It's coming!  But its not out yet.  A fanatastic coder named William is working on one as we speak.  Its due to come out, well, soon.  Check out <A HREF="http://www.botepidemic.com/aid/cgf/">his website</A> for the latest news.</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>21)&nbsp;<a NAME="Radio"></a><i>How do I make radio sounds?</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Answer:&nbsp; Bind a key to the radio sound you want your teammates to
hear.&nbsp; [bind KEY "radio treport"] is one example.&nbsp; Pressing KEY
will call out, "Team, report in!"&nbsp;&nbsp; For a complete list of the
radio binds, consult the radio.txt that came with the clientpak.&nbsp;
Additionally, installing the clientpak should have dropped a zip file with
some sample .cfgs into your quake2/action folder.&nbsp; Browse these sample
.cfgs for the radio commands too; they have been bound to the number pad
and the number keys.&nbsp; Cut and paste at your pleasure or peril.</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>22)&nbsp;<a NAME="q3"></a><i>Is the A-Team working on AQ3?</i></font>
<br><P>
<h4><i>Cap'n Swoosh says:  Perhaps I oughta let Admiral Suislide answer this.</i><p>"AQ3 remains a possibility but for the moment AHL is our only project and our only concern."
<p><i>Arrrrr!</i></h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>23)&nbsp;<a NAME="Message Board"></a><i>This FAQ didn't
answer my question.&nbsp; Where can I go for more detailed answers?</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<i>Cap'n Swoosh says:&nbsp;&nbsp; Ahoy, me hearties! Put on yer land legs
and step over to the <a href="https://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/aqdt.fear.net/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Action+Quake+2+General+Discussion&number=3&DaysPrune=10&LastLogin=">Action
Message Board</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be a rough place, true, but the rum's
good and flows freely, sure enough.&nbsp; So if ye have an eye to adventure
on the high seas, (and more importantly ye got a generous hand with the
dubloons and the grog,) there will be a matey there willin to help out,
and you may lay to that.</i></h4>
