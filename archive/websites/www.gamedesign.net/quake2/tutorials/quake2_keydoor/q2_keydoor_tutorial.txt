I sent one earlier, but I just updated it with some trigger_key stuff I didn't know before. Also included an editor shot as per Richard Neff's suggestion.

There have been a few questions on the discussion board recently regarding making doors that open with keys. Since the passage in the func_door tutorial is sketchy and a little hard to find, I decided to put this step-by-step one together (I needed the HTML practice too :-)).

Maybe you guys can see your way clear to post it.
