         I swear, these guys are worse than Intel!&nbsp; Just when you
         think you have one radiosity program nabbed, someone goes and
         releases another.

      <br><br>
         Actually, thanks goes to Tim Wright (Argh!) for making so many
         improvements.&nbsp; And thanks goes to Geoffry DeWan for
         getting the ball rolling.&nbspl If you don't already have
         ArghRad, download it now!

         Progress.
      </p>
      <br><br>
         For real, though, ArghRad is like a version update of gddqrad3.&nbsp; It
         fixes some of limitations of gddqrad3 that caused the shadows caused by
         sunlight to look blocky, and made some definite improvements (like ambient
         color control and multiple suns).&nbsp; It does all of this WITHOUT
         sacraficing support of gddqrad3 and qrad3.
      </p>
      <h3>
         What's new?
      </h3>
      <br><br>
         Here are all of the new keys available for the sun.&nbsp; If
         you're hungry for more, go to the online manual (not quite
         online yet).
      </p>
      <h5>
         &quot;_sun_angle&quot;<br>
         &quot;_sun_mangle&quot;<br>
         &quot;_sun_vector&quot;<br>
         &quot;_sun_diffuse&quot;<br>
         &quot;_sun_diffade&quot;<br>
         &quot;_sun_difwait&quot;
      </h5>
      <br><br>
         "_sun_angle" and "_sun_mangle" are aliases for the same
         function, as are "_sun_fade" and "_sun_wait", but that still
         leaves us with four new options, plus the ability to use up to
         four suns.
      </p>
      <div class="text">
         <a name=four>
         Did you say FOUR suns?
      </div>
      <br><br>
         Yes!&nbsp; You can now use up to four suns in your maps, each
         with their own color and angle.&nbsp; To use multiple suns, you
         would simply define them as you normally do, except you
         substitute "_sun2" "_sun3" and "_sun4" for "_sun" when entering
         information on your second, third, and fourth suns.
      </p>
      <br><br>
         You can use multiple suns on all of the _sun keys except
         "_sun_ambient".
      </p>
      <div class="text">
         <a name=shadow>
         Ambient shadow coloring
      </div>
      <br><br>
         You can color your ambient shadows now (the part that can't see
         the sun, but can see the sky).&nbsp; If define a straight light
         value instead of a color value, the shadow color will default
         to the average of all of your suns' colors.&nbsp; To define the
         color of the shadow, simply enter three values after the
         "_sun_ambient" key instead of one.
      </p>
      <h5>
         &quot;_sun_ambient&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;[red] [green] [blue]&quot;
      </h5>
      <br><br>
         Each value represents the brightness of each individual color,
         so if the value entered were 120 150 50, the shadow color would
         have a minimum red brightness of 120, a minimum green brightness
         of 150, and a minimum blue brightness of 50.
      </p>
      <div class="text">
         <a name=diffusion>
         Shadow diffusion
      </div>
      <br><br>
         This feature is so freakin' cool, I can't contain myself!&nbsp;
         What shadow diffusion does is provide an buffer of hazy shadow
         between the shade and the direct sunlight.&nbsp; This can make
         your shadows look much smoother less harsh.&nbsp; To define the
         diffusion, simply enter a value less than the highlight value,
         and greater than the shadow value.
      </p>
      <h5>
         &quot;_sun_diffuse&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;[value]&quot;
      </h5>
      <br><br>
         To control the fade distance of the diffusion, Tim Wright has
         added the _sun_diffade and _sun_difwait keys.&nbsp; A less than
         1 will cause the diffusion to fade out slower, while a value
         greater than 1 will make it fade faster.&nbsp; Be aware,
         however, that if you use a large value, you may need to reduce
         your -chopsky value (or else you will get a chunky shadow).
         
         This defaults to a value of 1, and any value entered will scale 
         relative to the default.&nbsp; For example, if you entered a
         value of .5, the diffuasion would fade twice as rapidly as it
         did at 1.
      </p>

         <a name=alternate>
         Alternate aiming techniques
      </div>
      <br><br>
         There are now two additional ways to aim your sun (both of
         which you can substitute for the "_sun" "targetname"
         method.&nbsp; The first method is angle aiming.&nbsp; This uses
         pitch and yaw to aim.&nbsp; This method is the same as is used
         to aim info_player_intermission minus the roll.
      </p>
      <br><br>
         The yaw is the position on the z axis.&nbsp; You aim yaw the
         same way you aim a door, or a player facing, with 0 pointing
         east, and moving counter-clockwise.&nbsp; Pitch is the angle on
         the horizon.&nbsp; Pitch values range from negative 90 to
         positive 90.  -90 points straight down, and 90 points straight
         up.
      </p>
      <h5>
         &quot;_sun_angle&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;[yaw] [pitch]&quot;
      </h5>
      <h5>
         &quot;_sun_mangle&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;[yaw] [pitch]&quot;
      </h5>
      <br><br>
         The second method is vector aiming.&nbsp; By using vector
         aiming, you enter a vector coordinate into the value field, and
         ArghRad will calculate the angle from the origin (0 0 0) to the
         vector (x y z) coordinates you entered.&nbsp; The resulting angle
         will be the sun's angle.
