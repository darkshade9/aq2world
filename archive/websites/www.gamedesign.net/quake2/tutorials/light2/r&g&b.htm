  <br><br>Green, Red AND Blue Entity Lighting.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">Ugh, now this has really pushed it too far. Here, we lose one 
    of the saving graces - brightness. No level of brightness is godd enough except 
    0. However, the placing has again created an interesting effect on the wall. 
    But, let's be honest. The only place you'll find this is in a disco. So, unless 
    you're creating a pastiche on early 80's decor, DON'T DO THIS. It's not realistic, 
    and it sure as hell ain't clever.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">Now, to be fair, I have chosen the worst possible case. I've 
    taken the three basic colours, Red, Green and Blue, which are rather far apart 
    in the spectrum. But it does demonstrate a point. Mixing coloured Entity lights 
    can look foul. The problem is, when most people use entity lights, they don't 
    associate them to a source. Now, I have said that you don't have to source 
    light everything (missed that, read back to the Basics section). And you don't. 
    But putting bold colours in like this is really pushing it. I would recommend 
    to anyone putting entity lighting in to at least choose a colour that is close 
    to the rest of the lighting in the room, unless it is for special effect.</p>
