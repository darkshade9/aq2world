  <br><br>Green and Red Entity Lighting</p>
  <p align="LEFT">This is taking the previous picture one step further down the 
    path to destruction (or at least, vomit). Here, there is the same green entity 
    light, but there is now an added red entity light. To be honest, there are 
    only two saving graces to this scene. 1. The Red light is on quite a low setting. 
    2. Its placing means that it creates some interesting effects with the shadows 
    - i.e. colours the shadows on one side red. This is _just_ about acceptable 
    for lighting. If the Red light is flashing, you might _just_ get away with 
    it. But to be honest - just don't try, it's not worth it.</p>
  <p align="LEFT">However, on another point. The Red light is not sourced at the 
    moment. It does look out of place, but only because of the colour. If I had 
    chosen a colour nearer to Green, then it would fit in pretty well. Here is 
    an example of an unsourced light.</p>
