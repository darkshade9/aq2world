    into designing rocks. However, although this picture is not the most amazing 
    in the world, you can see that the shadows on the rock do help to define it, 
    and make it stand out more from the face behind it. It also helps considerably 
    with the girders coming out of the rock, bringing the one on the right further 
    out from the rock than the one on the left.</p>
