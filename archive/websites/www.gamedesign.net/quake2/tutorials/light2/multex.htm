  <p align="LEFT">Now this is more like it. Ok, so the colours are less harsh 
    and obvious, but again, the point is shown. Texture lights mix together far 
    better than do entity lights. Here, the melding between colours is not really 
    noticable, and yet, it definitely adds to the scene. It is far more realistic 
    to use texture lighting than it is to use coloured lighting. Unless you're 
    careful. For another example on lighting this scene, see the Tricks section.</p>
