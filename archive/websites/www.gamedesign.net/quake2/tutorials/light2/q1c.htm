  <br><br>The most moody of the shots. A store room, which IMO is very nicely lit. 
    The lights on the top are placed between each girder, and cause them all to 
    cast 'ribs' everywhere. The low lighting on the ceilings below help make the 
    boxes cast their own shadows, which keeps this room relatively shrowded in 
    gllom. And yet there are plenty of areas with plenty of light. Running around 
    in here with 4 other people is a nightmare, very scary, and a hell of a lot 
    of fun. Sniping in here is even better, since you can climb up to some of 
    the crates and hide. Mind you, you're trapped there as well :)</p>
