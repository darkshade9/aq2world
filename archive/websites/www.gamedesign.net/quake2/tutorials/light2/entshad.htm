  <p align="LEFT">This image clearly shows the defined shadows provided by lighting 
    a scene with an entity light. The entity is effectively a point light - much 
    like the sun. Because of this, the light is easily stopped by objects (occluders). 
    The light doesn't seep round the side of the occluder, because the source 
    is smaller than the width of it. Unfortunately, this can sometimes leave you 
    with blocky shadows, though with careful placing (this is not an example), 
    this can be minimised. This scene is a lot brighter than the texture lit scene, 
    because 1. the light is white and 2. it's slightly stronger.</p>
