  <p align="LEFT">OK, so It's not the most pretty image in the world, but it does 
    demonstrate some effects. Careful use of coloured entity lights creates a 
    realistic effect, while still allowing for the interesting shadows. If you 
    don't like the way they cut out, you could remove the lower lights, which 
    are on very strong - they are small texture lights, which sometimes require 
    ridiculously high lighting values - each of these has a value of 25,000, yet 
    they don't really seem to add that much. They do, actually, but the effect 
    is very subtle.</p>
