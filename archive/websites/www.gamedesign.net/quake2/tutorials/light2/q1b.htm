  <br><br>Ah, Entity Lighting :) Plenty of it here. As it happens, this room is mostly 
    sourced. The main light is above the walkway, casting a shadow beneath it, 
    and the light on the right lightens these shadows. Again, the Shadows help 
    contrast between the various positions of items in the room. The Door Frame 
    really 'comes out' at you, and the slight shadows on each step of the stairs 
    help them stand out more, and appear more real. I quite like this one ;) The 
    shadows provide good places to hide from other DMers, if you are so inclined, 
    and yet one shot will show you up. Nice.</p>
