<blockquote>
<h4><b>For those out there that don't know, tell us a little about yourself.</b></h4>
<blockquote>
I do the Quake 2 FAQ and Half-Life FAQ here at Rust.  I've also done some
tutorials for Rust, both on my own and with others.  I'm one of the very small
few who use Deathmatch Maker 2 (DMM 2) and actually LIKE it, so I've done
Lotus ScreenCam tutorials for that editor for DeathEd
(<a href="http://deathed.stomped.com">http://deathed.stomped.com</a>)  I also use Quark to a certain degree to fill in
the limitations of DMM2.
<Br><br>
I've done editing since Doom and even won a Quake 1 editing design contest
sponsored by Virtus and Happy Puppy.  (In retrospect, it's a pretty simple map
compared to what's being done now -- but, if you REALLY want to see it, it can
be found at DeathEd.)  My little Q2 site is at
<a href="http://members.aol.com/dmm2editor">http://members.aol.com/dmm2editor</a> if you want to see my 1 Q2 map (although, I
swear I'll finish some more soon - I'm currently jumping between 3 Q2 maps and
1 HL map).
<Br><br>
And if you're really bored, you can see what I actually do for a living at:
<a href="http://www.net-tech-group.com">http://www.net-tech-group.com</a>.  But, I'd say that's probably more than you
wanted to know anyway.
</blockquote>
<br><br>
<h4><b>While writing the Q2 FAQ and reading thousands of posts on the discussion
boards, what do you think is the largest problem that beginner level designers
struggle with?</b></h4>
<blockquote>
Actually, there is more than just one problem really.  But, I think the
biggest hurdle that beginners have to deal with it the sheer complexity of
editing.  Considering that Id has slowly done a progression of games where
things keep building on certain concepts of previous games, a lot of very
technical information has to be learned.  From the other end is the creative
side, one can be very well versed in the technical concepts of entity
attributes and poly counts, but it's no good if you can't get an idea to pop
into you head!
<Br><br>
The problem with the complexity is simply that beginners not only have to know
what entities they need, but annoying little details like poly counts, clip
brushes, compiling times.  Once they get over the technical hurdle, they have
to get over the design pitfalls and make a level that looks and plays well.
And probably the biggest beginner design mistake is creating a big open area
for DM play.  If they manage to get over the rather limiting engine problems,
they still won't have a really playable map since that design has already been
done (probably a lot better) by other mappers, or if you include Q2DM1 into
that category -- by Id themselves. 
 <Br><Br>
And I haven't even gone into the complexity of not only learning about Quake 2
or whatever game they're designing for, but learning the features of the
editor as well.</blockquote>
<br><br>
<h4><b>What games are you really looking forward to in the future?</b></h4>
<blockquote>
Um...what other games are there except Q3 Arena?  Half-Life was the only other
FPS that I was all that really interested in after the release of Q2, and
since I've already got that, not much I'm really looking forward to.
<br><br>
I will admit, Half-Life did impress the heck out of me though.  I did get and
play Unreal, but I just had a hard time getting into it.  I do like the
slightly better AI of the Unreal BOTS over Q2's Eraser BOTS (and really wish
there were BOTS for Half-Life).  But, never got into the Single Player aspect
of Unreal like I did with Half-Life.  I think the "innocent" NPCs of Half-Life
add a new dimension to the game.  But, I certainly don't mean to imply that's
the only new and good aspect of HL.
<Br><Br>
And I don't want to sound like I'm being to critical of Unreal - it's a very
good game.  I just didn't get into myself.  But, that's just my personal
opinion.
</blockquote>
<br><br>
<h4><b>How long have you been editing levels?</b></h4>
<blockquote>
Since the Doom days.  And truthfully, I wouldn't even be editing levels if my
wife and I didn't enjoy playing DM against each other over the LAN here.</blockquote>
<br><br>
<h4><b>What are your thoughts on Half-Life editing?</b></h4>
<blockquote>
Certainly something I'm looking forward to.  My biggest limitations are
starting over with a new entity set and relearning WorldCraft.  I'm also
playing around with Quark's HL editing, but I haven't made up my mind which
editor I'll end up using full time.  WC is able to import my Q2 .map files a
lot better, but Quark is something I'm more comfortable doing new maps or
learning how Valve did certain things.
<br><br>
But, I'm still trying to finish some Q2 maps, so Half-Life editing is kinda on
the back burner for the time being.  Sure, I'm messing around with it, but I'm
not too deep into actually creating a level. Although, I am working on a Q2
map that I've converted over to HL.</blockquote>
<br><br>
<h4><b>Do you have plans to release any more of your own levels? Maybe a Half-Life
level?</b></h4>

<blockquote>Oh yeah.  The biggest limitation is time, which is something all hobby-type
mappers have to contend with.  Of course, if I did this for a living, then
obviously I'd have more time to create levels, but then again, I doubt I'd
enjoy it as much.  But, like I mentioned above, I'm currently working on 3 Q2
maps - one DM-only for a contest, one SP (but DM playable) conversion of a Q1
map (actually a Q1 map that was initially shipped with DMM1 that I thought
would look good in Q2), and I'm supposed to be converting another SP Q1 map to
Q2 done by Astaroth who started it, but doesn't have the time to finish it.
<br><br>
Add to that the HL map that I'm working on is the second Q2 map I listed, but
I'm porting it over to HL.  I'll hopefully release it as BOTH as Q2 and HL
map, but haven't decided yet.
<br><br>
But, these things do take a lot of time for me -- largely because it's
sometimes hard for me to get motivated to work on maps and the fact that I've
got billable and other work to do. </blockquote>
<br><br>
<h4><b>What are your thoughts on the future of the user made level editing
community?</b></h4>
<blockquote>
Um, I dunno.  I'm hardly any sort of a visionary here.  I would imagine with
Half-Life being so popular in the discussion boards, that you'll see a lot of
good HL maps (and there are already some excellent ones) coming out soon.  I
doubt it signals the end of Q2 mapping, however.  I don't think any interest
of Id games really dies out until Id themselves releases a new game.
<br><Br>
I think that once Q3 Arena comes out, I think most people who are interested
in creating SP levels will probably do editing in HL. And those interested in
DM maps will develop them in Q3.  And of course, Team Fortress types will
flock to it when the HL version is released.  Of course, they'll be some
overlap where each type of level is developed for each game, but I think the
majority of maps for a certain type of play will start to be game specific.
(At least until the next generation of FPS comes out.)</blockquote>
<br><br>
<h4><b>Seen any good movies lately?</b></h4>
<blockquote>
Um...not really.  The last movie I saw was "Saving Private Ryan" which I
enjoyed.  But, I haven't been to the theater much.  I did get a DVD player
though - does that count? :-)
<br><br>
Anyway, thanks for the opportunity to be interviewed -- although I don't know
who would possibly have read this far.  But, if you did, thanks!  I hope you
enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed doing it.  Now, go do something
constructive with your time, like getting back to creating levels so I have an
excuse to spend time playing Q2 and HL.</blockquote>
<br><br>
I would like to thank Richard for taking the time to answer these questions.
