With Half-Life being the level design craze right now, and no Half-Life level archive on cdrom.com, Kenneth Stumpf aka 'Radium' has come to the resque.
<br><br>
<a href="http://www.planethalflife.com/radium/">Radium</a> reviews Deathmatch and Single Player Half-Life maps on a daily basis, giving people a great resource to check out and download user made Half-Life levels.
<br><br>
We had a chance to talk to Kenneth Stumpf aka 'Radium' about him and himself, his site, and the future of his site. Read the interview below.

<blockquote>
<h4><b>First off, tell us a little about yourself, name, job, etc.</b></h4>
<blockquote>
My name's Kenneth Stumpf.  I was born and raised in Venice, Lousiana, which
is a small... swampy... alligator-infested town abouth seventy miles south
of New Orleans.  Im currently a second year Information Systems major at
Nicholl's State University.</blockquote>
<br><br>
<h4><b>what initially gave you the idea to start radium?</b></h4>
<blockquote>
Well, we always downloaded a lot of Quake2 maps to play on our LAN, and I
noticed that of the hundreds I downloaded, there were only a few we played
consistenly.  Since I wanted to get involved in the HL community, I thought
a map review site that "tells it like it is" would be a good contribution
and something alot of people would enjoy.  Its our goal to provide reviews
that are detailed enough so that a visitor can decide whether or not he
would enjoy a map before downloading it.</blockquote>
<br><br>
<h4><b>Since you've probably played more Half-Life maps then anyone out there,
what common mistakes do you see map authors making?</b></h4>
<blockquote>
Id say one of the most common errors has been using skies improperly.  In
over half the levels Ive played, there are spots where you can gauss jump
out of the map.  This even showed up in the recent Team9 map released by
Valve.</blockquote>
<br><br>
<h4><b>What does the future hold for Radium? Ever plan on covering any other
games besides Half-Life?</b></h4>
<blockquote>
My goal for the future is to refine things as much as possible and add new
features at the same time.  My friend Shasta is currently working on a java
applet to sort our huge database of maps.  Its coming along great, and Im
glad to see someone has finally found a good use for a java applet.  I also
want to get our awards program started soon.  This would just be a little
something extra to denote credit where due.  We plan to have "Best of"
categories as well as fun awards such as "Funkiest Name".
<br><br>
As for covering other games... definately.  We'll be launching our sister
site, radium TF, the same day that Team Fortress Classic is released.  We
plan to have reviews of the included levels within hours of its release.
Down the road, we will also cover Team Fortress 2 maps at radium TF.  The
new site has all new graphics and will be hosted at PlanetFortress.</blockquote>
<br><br>
<h4><b>Have you ever thought of making your own levels?</b></h4>
<blockquote>
I made lots of levels for Quake2.  I only finished a few of them, and I
never did release any.  I usually would get a cool idea, build it, and move
on to my next idea instead of fleshing out the first one.  I really aimed to
just "make my idea" instead of creating a playable level.  As for Half-Life
editing, Ive dabbled in it a bit, but so far I have seen my fair share of
crashes with WorldCraft and its still a bit too finicky for me to use.  Its
just as well, since Im out of free time as it is.</blockquote>
<br><br>
<h4><b>Do you tailor your reviews more to the mappers, or to the prospective
players?</b></h4>

<blockquote>I really aim at keeping players in mind.  The majority of visitors just want
to find a good map and start playing, so I try to help people do that when
possible.  I also point out construction errors when I see them, but I dont
usually test maps in developer mode due to time constraints.</blockquote>
<br><br>
<h4><b>Do you ever get feedback from level designers about your reviews? Have
you ever gone back and changed an review after some feedback?</b></h4>
<blockquote>
Ive gotten alot of positive response from the level designers so far.  Most
people seem to appreciate the blunt opinions, which is surprising to me.  I
often get emails from the mappers agreeing with the reviews of their levels.
<br><br>
Ive only had to change one review out of two hundred.  That review was "The
Gantry".  I really enjoyed this level, despite its very high r_speeds and
lust for power.  In my review I called it "pro material", and later some
concerned mappers pointed out to me that a pro would not release a map with
the flaws this map had.  I stood by my opinions, but I did edit the review
to change anything that could have been misleading and suggested it was of a
quality it was not.  This is still one of my favorite maps for small LAN
games, and no matter what flaws it has, it probably always will be.</blockquote>
<br><br>
<h4><b>I was wondering what your thoughts are on the recent
thread(<a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/Forum2/HTML/000076.html">thread</a>) on
the rust discussion board about your rating system. Has then had any affect on
the way you rate the levels?</b></h4>
<blockquote>
Well, for a while this was a very useful thread, and I think I walked away
from it with alot of ideas and ways to improve.  Basically the parties
involved were concerned that I promote some levels that exhibit high
r_speeds.  Many mappers map with the motto that "map + high r_speeds =
garbage".  Im not a mapper, and I completely disagree with this thinking.
Maybe this is true for mappers, but in all practicality, some of the most
popular maps are technically terrible.  I like to use X-Fire for an example
here.  This map shows plenty of errors and requires a fast machine, but I
always see four or five servers running this map and people play it.  Other
servers have technically correct maps running, but few players.  This seems
like enough proof to me that some people arent concerned with technical
flaws as long as the map is enjoyable.  I definately include myself in this
category.  I love X-Fire, despite its flaws.
<br><br>
The discussion didnt have much effect on our rating of the levels per se,
but I am alot more careful to point out high r_speeds and warn players of
them.  I also am very careful not to call a level something its not, or to
mislead people in any way.</blockquote>
<br><br>

<h4><b>What games are you most looking forward to? and why</b></h4>


<blockquote>Definately Team Fortress 2 and Quake3.  I exclusively played the original
Team Fortress until Quake 2 came out, so Im looking foward to TF2 very much.
I have no doubt in my mind that id Software is going to break the mold again
with Quake3.  They always do.</blockquote>
<br><br>
<h4><b>Seen any good movies lately?</b></h4>


<blockquote>Not lately, but I cant wait to see the new Star Wars movie and Austin Powers 2.</blockquote>

<br><br>
<h4><b>What are your favorite 5 games of all time?</b></h4>

<blockquote>
Id have to say the number one spot is shared by Half-Life and Quake2.  I
love both of these games and Im really looking forward to the Half-Life SDK
so we can start seeing some mods!  I also loved Quake, Doom2, and WarCraft2.</blockquote>
<br><br>
<h4><b>what do you think of the thoughts going around that a lot of Half-Life
maps are being built with the same style and look as quake2?</b></h4>

<blockquote>
I think its a natural trend.  People love Quake2 and its only logical that
some mappers are going to try to incorporate the things that they enjoyed so
much about it into their maps for Half-Life.  In my opinion, its a good
thing.  There are plenty of maps available that are very unique and fresh,
but having some solid Q2-style maps doesnt hurt at all.</blockquote>
<br><br>
<h4><b>Any closing thoughts?</b></h4>


<blockquote>Id just like to thank all the mappers out there for all their hard work and
creativity.  Alot of times players take the maps they play for granted and
dont stop to think "hey, someone made this!".</blockquote>
<br><br>
We at rust would like to thank Kenneth for taking the time to answer our questions. Like...go check out <a href="http://www.planethalflife.com/radium/">Radium</a> now.
