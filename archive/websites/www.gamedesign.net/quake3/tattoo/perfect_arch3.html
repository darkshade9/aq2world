This tutorial will demonstrate the procedures that need be taken to make a perfect a arch.<br><br>


<table width="780" border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">

Ok, this should be easy for you now and I probably don't need to write the rest of this but I'm going to just for the people that might 
need it.<br><br>
What ya need to do here is unselect the Arch and select the <font color="Yellow">End&nbsp;cap</font>. You'll need to resize it to the 
outer edges of the Arch and you'll see how the top of the Arch is out of shape. After you resize it, you'll have to reposition the 
<font color="Yellow">End&nbsp;cap</font> so that you can select the Arch. Now select the Arch again and we'll start.

<td valign="top">
As you can see here there are only two <font color="Yellow">Vertices</font> that need moving. The two corners and middle 
are already in line. Now go to the <font color="Yellow">Selection</font> menu and select 
<font color="Yellow">Drag/Drag&nbsp;Vertices</font>. The top left <font color="Yellow">Vertice</font> is the one that we'll be moving.<br><br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="22.jpg" width="500" height="481" border="0">
</td>
<td valign="top">
After you have selected <font color="Yellow">Drag/Drag&nbsp;Vertices</font>, change your Grid again to <font color="Yellow">Grid1</font> 
and zoom in and move the <font color="Yellow">Vertice</font> to the upper left corner as shown in the picture.<br><br>
Now for the right side.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="23.jpg" width="500" height="537" border="0">
</td>
<td valign="top">
Here, you'll do the same thing as the left side. After this one is aligned, unselect it and zoom out and you'll how it 
looks all lined upped as in the next picture.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="24.jpg" width="478" height="290" border="0">
</td>
<td valign="top">
Don't forget to save your work.<br><br>
Now there's only one more thing to do. That's resize the <font color="Yellow">End&nbsp;cap</font> so that it is aligned 
with the center of the arch like in the next picture.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="25.jpg" width="431" height="237" border="0">
</td>
<td valign="top">
You really can't see if it is out of line or not and probably wouldn't even matter but if you zoom in and look closer 
like in the next picture, you'll see that it isn't correct.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="26.jpg" width="572" height="526" border="0">
</td>
<td valign="top">
Here you'll see that it 'is' off a little. This probably wouldn't make a difference, but, just for the correct alignment 
I'm going to go ahead and align this too.

<img src="27.jpg" width="466" height="355" border="0">

The <font color="Red">red circle</font> is the <font color="Yellow">Vertice</font> we will be moving.

<tr>
<td>
<img src="28.jpg" width="559" height="473" border="0">
</td>
<td valign="top">
This is where it ended up and is aligned. Now go to the right side and move that one.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="29.jpg" width="544" height="502" border="0">
</td>
<td valign="top">
This is where this one is aligned. Now we'll check the middle to see if it needs to be aligned.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="30.jpg" width="451" height="545" border="0">
</td>
<td valign="top">
This needed to be aligned as well. Now we'll go to the left end and align that one.
</td>

<img src="31.jpg" width="445" height="465" border="0">

<td valign="top">
This one needed aligning. Now go to the right end.
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<img src="32.jpg" width="450" height="501" border="0">

<td valign="top">
This needed aligning as well. Ok, now zoom out and you'll see how it looks.

<td valign="top">
Here is the finished arch. I've taken and made three <font color="Yellow">End&nbsp;caps</font> and put them in, as you can see of coarse 
just so you would see how it looks all lined up.<br><br>

And there ya have it,<br> <font color="Blue"><b>'The&nbsp;Perfect&nbsp;Arch'</b></font>.

Well, that was my good deed for today. I sure hope this helps someone out. I don't want anyone to think that I'm a Q3Radient guru or 
anything. This is just something I figured out since it's release and wanted to share what I have learned with everyone else that is 
wanting to make killer maps for Quake III Arena. I might write another tutorial on other things as I learn them. Just right now, I need 
to concentrate on the making of my own map.<br><br>
All the credit I can give for my knowledge would be to raYGunn and the rest of the crew at 
<a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/">RUST</a>.<br> They are who I turn to when in need of an answer. Thanks guys...<br><br>
