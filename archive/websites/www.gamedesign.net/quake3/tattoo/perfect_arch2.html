This tutorial will demonstrate the procedures that need be taken to make a perfect a arch.<br><br>

Ok, now, you'll probably want to turn your arch around the proper way. You don't have to right now. It's just the way I've done it. 
The way it looks now would work, but it's not the way to go if you want perfection. You'll notice from the picture that the shape of 
this isn't correct. The ends and the very top are are not sized correctly with the grid. It doesn't hit both sides of the major grid to 
make a 64 unit square. It's more like 58 or 59. And in between that it is squeezed a little. This is what we're going to fix.<br><br>
From here, we're going to drag the vertices to get the correct shape.<br><br>
First you'll need to resize this to a descent grid size. I like to use <font color="Yellow">Grid16</font>, but you may use what ya like. 
You'll want to resize it to the size you want it to be when finished. The only important thing here is that only the 
<font color="Yellow">outer edges</font> of this should be hitting the major grid. This makes it easier on you to get it 
to where it needs to be with the way I do this. You'll find out later on what I mean by this as you make more of these. Also, I don't
 know if this is the way the guys at ID Software does their arches, it's just the way I found to do it to look correct.

<td valign="top">
Ok, from here, you'll need to make an <font color="Yellow">End&nbsp;cap</font>. I use the <font color="Yellow">End&nbsp;cap</font> 
because it the correct shape already and does not need to be reshaped. It is the standard shape of all the curves in Quake III Arena.<br><br>
First draw another brush, any size, and go to the <font color="Yellow">Curve</font> menu 
and select <font color="Yellow">End&nbsp;cap</font>. Now turn it and position it by your arch to look like the picture. From this 
you can see where the imperfections are. Make CERTAIN that the <font color="Yellow">End&nbsp;cap</font> is positioned correctly 
on the major grid lines, as shown. After you've done that, unselect the <font color="Yellow">End&nbsp;cap</font> and select the arch. 
you may have to move these around a little so you can select each one when you like. By that, I mean, the 
<font color="Yellow">End&nbsp;cap</font> should be in front of the arch.

After you have everything in position and the arch selected, go to the <font color="Yellow">Selection</font> menu and select 
<font color="Yellow">Drag/Drag&nbsp;Vertices</font>.

Here you should see the <font color="Yellow">Vertices</font> around the arch. These are what we move to reposition the arch so it is 
the correct shape. Now, this can get a little tricky too. First, save your work. You don't have to unselect anything to so.

First you'll need to set your grid again to <font color="Yellow">Grid1</font> and zoom in to see the grid lines. Now, go to the bottom 
left end of the arch and position your mouse over the right <font color="Yellow">Vertice</font>.
</td>

<tr>

<img src="14.jpg" width="475" height="517" alt="" border="0">
</td>
<td valign="top">
Now press and hold the left button and drag the corner right <font color="Yellow">Vertice</font> to the right 
so that the corners of both the arch and the <font color="Yellow">End&nbsp;cap</font> are perfectly in line.<br><br>
One thing you'll have to be careful about is if you click on a <font color="Yellow">Vertice</font> and let off and go right back to it 
and drag it again, you'll notice that there are more <font color="Yellow">Vertices</font> under the one and/or ones you moved. This can 
get aggravating. Not to worry though. Just hit escape and move the <font color="Yellow">Vertice</font> back to where ya started.<br><br>
There are 5 <font color="Yellow">Vertices</font> that need to be 
moved for the bottom. Then 5 for the top and 5 for the middle. There are 15 <font color="Yellow">Vertices</font> all together that
need to be moved.<br><br>
Ok, now go onto the middle bottom <font color="Yellow">Vertice</font>.

<td valign="top">
Now align that to the very top of the <font color="Yellow">End&nbsp;cap</font>. Now go on to the right end of the arch.

<img src="16.jpg" width="475" height="292" border="0">

<td valign="top">
Align this one up with the corners. Now just move up to the <font color="Yellow">Vertice</font> between the right end and the middle one.

<td valign="top">
This one is a little tricky. The <font color="Yellow">Vertice</font> isn't at the corner or where the lines meet but up into the 
arch a little. You can see it in the picture. Just move it down and to the left and align the line of both the Arch and the 
<font color="Yellow">End&nbsp;cap</font>. Now one more at the other end.

Same as the last. Line it up the same way. Now zoom out and the next picture is what it should look like all lined up.

This is the way it looks with the correct shape at the bottom.<br><br>
Now save your work and we'll move onto the top <font color="Yellow">Vertices</font>.<br>
