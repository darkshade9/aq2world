Z||000000||Scott||02-23-99||04:52 AM||arclite@home.com||This is incredible.  I made some adjustments to the map.  Added lighting and fixed a leak in the wall.  Changed some textures and compiled.  Everything was great before hand but this time it gave me the SZ_Getspace: Overflow  What the heck is this?<br>Here is the BSP message<br>entity 0, brush 1089: bounds out of range<br>  Brush: Line 8613, file E:\Quake2\baseq2\maps\2fortst6wf.map<br>  Bounds: -1618 4907 -17 -> -1610 5227 129<br>entity 0, brush 1090: bounds out of range<br>  Brush: Line 8621, file E:\Quake2\baseq2\maps\2fortst6wf.map<br>  Bounds: -1618 4907 -128 -> -1610 5002 -16<br>entity 0, brush 1091: bounds out of range<br>  Brush: Line 8629, file E:\Quake2\baseq2\maps\2fortst6wf.map<br>  Bounds: -1618 5114 -128 -> -1610 5227 -16<br>entity 0, brush 1092: bounds out of range<br>  Brush: Line 8637, file E:\Quake2\baseq2\maps\2fortst6wf.map<br>  Bounds: -1618 5002 -128 -> -1610 5114 -126<br>0...1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...

I read the reame but I guess I just don't know enough yet to have it be any real help.  I'm supposed to release the map today (Tuesday).   <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/frown.gif"><br>Please help.  I can't find anything wrong.<p>Scott

Everything in your map must fit inside a cube 8192 units wide on each side, centered at 0,0,0. Put another way, you can't have any brushes or entities outside the limits +/- 4096 in any direction.<p>This error can also be generated if a brush is missing a face. However, in your case both the minimum and maximum Y values are outside the limits, so I'm pretty sure you have brushes outside the limits. You should have also had "no visible sides on brush" errors for these brushes.<p>You'll definitely need to fix these, as brushes that extend outside those limits won't be drawn in the game.<p>This is unrelated to your SZ_Getspace:Overflow problem, though. This error indicates that the game engine can see too many entities. Usually running a -fast vis will solve this problem. If it doesn't, you might be able to get rid of it with a full vis. If <b>that</b> doesn't work, you'll need to do one or more of the following:<br>1) get rid of stuff<br>2) use func_areaportals in all of your doors<br>3) add vis-blocking architecture (90 deg. bends in hallways, doughnut hallways, etc.)<p>Note that if a full vis solves the problem when a -fast vis doesn't, you should probably do some of these things anyway, because you are very likely right on the edge of producing this error some time <b>after</b> startup - say during an attack by gunners or another player with grenades or rockets.<br><P>------------------<BR>David Hyde<br> <A HREF="http://www.magnolia.net/~rascal" TARGET=_blank>www.magnolia.net/~rascal</A> 
Z||000002||Scott||02-23-99||05:28 AM||arclite@home.com||Hmmmm, I don't recall making anything outside of that at all.  Maybe a stray brush I pasted and lost somewhere?  Heh, stupider things have happened to me.<br>To be honest I think I'm missing something.  I hate to sound like I'm emntally challenged but I can't find anything at all.  I've loaded it in BSP and Qoole.  I'm not a big fan of any of the others yet.<br>About the overflow.  I'll give it a try and see if that'll shut Q2 up.   <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>If this doesn't work, I sure hope someone else has gone through this.<p>The one time I didn't save my map to 2 different locations and this happens.  Argh!<p>Thanks David<p>Scott<br>

Z||000004||Scott||02-23-99||06:30 AM||arclite@home.com||1.) Sorry for the multiple replies.  <br>2.) The coordinates that Mapspy gives.  Are those top view, side view, slightly ascew view?  Not sure which view to hunt them down in.<br>The vis -fast worked like a charm.  I guess I should've known that from the docs.  Apologies for that.<br>I still get the 0 poly during BSP.  I've hunted everywhere.  I found a brush that was level with the top of the sky and fixed that but it still did it.  I'm at a loss now.  I guess I'll keep hunting and going bald.  Unless some kind soul would like me to send it to them for inspection.   <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>Scott
Z||000005||Scott||02-23-99||06:34 AM||arclite@home.com||FOUND IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<p>Woohoo!<br>It was a tiny little brush that was annoying the beejeebers out of my trying to line up a replacement wall.  I grabbed the little terd and slung it across the map.  There it sat giving me a tumor.  hehe<p>Thanks for the help!  <p>Scott
Z||000006||David Hyde||02-23-99||07:20 AM||rascal@magnolia.net||Scott,<br>Glad to hear you got the problem fixed. For future reference, the bounding box presented by MapSpy (and by your bsp compiler) gives the extents of an imaginary box that encloses your brush as (xmin, ymin, zmin) to (xmax, ymax, zmax)... so it's not really tied to any one view. Another way to think of it is these are two points at opposite corners of a box that just fits around the brush.<br><P>------------------<BR>David Hyde<br> <A HREF="http://www.magnolia.net/~rascal" TARGET=_blank>www.magnolia.net/~rascal</A>
