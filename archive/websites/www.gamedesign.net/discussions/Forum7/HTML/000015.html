<HR>I really don't understand what the problem is with these sorts of contests?  Is it a lot of work, well yeah, but then again, there are plenty of people designing levels, textures, etc. for free as a hobby anyway.  Granted you lose "ownership" of the level - which really isn't that big of a deal unless you plan on distributing the level in another format anyway.<p>Personally, from the company's point of view, heck, just like you mentioned, it's an easy way to get levels for a game without hiring people to do it, with still some sort of compensation.<p>Basically, it simply comes down to if one feels the level of work is worth the potiential reward.  In this case, I dunno if I'd simply want something like game engine rights, but then again, there may be someone who does.<p>Hardly worth complaining about, IMHO.  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p><P>------------------<BR>Richard Neff<br> <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/dmm2editor" TARGET=_blank>http://members.aol.com/dmm2editor</A> </div></td></tr>

<HR>Oh, I guess I should mention that I have entered a level-design contest way back (in computer game terms  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/biggrin.gif">) during the days of Quake 1.  Virtus, the makers of DMM, did a DMM/Quake level-design contest and I happened to win a Dell P200 computer.  Supposedly, they still "own" the level I did (which by comparison seems to be a very amaturish affair  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/biggrin.gif">) but, the never did anything with the level, so it got fully distributed around via the DMM listserv and from cdrom.com.<p>Of course, I didn't have to do anything other than a level - no new textures, models, etc.  I suspect it was primarily just a promotion to get people to design levels with DMM, but they didn't really seem too bothered with using the levels for anything.<p>Anyway, I just thought I should mention that I've done the contest thing before.  Obviously, if you don't feel the work/reward tradeoff is good, then I wouldn't bother with it.<p><P>------------------<BR>Richard Neff<br> <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/dmm2editor" TARGET=_blank>http://members.aol.com/dmm2editor</A> </div></td></tr>

<HR>I don't think this is right at all. I could see if you got prizes and they could use this stuff for a demo, but why do you have to give them the rights to the stuff? It sounds to me like they are looking for a mass of Quake2 work that they will most likely release as some sort of "Net Scape" thing. Can they do that? The answer is YES and you won't be able to do anything about it if that happens.<p>Also, those screen shots of the HAWK engine don't look much different than Quake2 running on a slick 3d card... how do we know that that's not the case here?<p>I know that I'm not going to be entering this contest... just seems to risky to me. It's a hell of a lot of work you have to do and on top of that you lose the rights to your work.</div></td></tr>

<HR>Here's what I think of this crap (and that's what it is, too):<p>Rather than take a risk on hiring or contracting a fixed number of employees, these companies can con a lot of starry-eyed "wanna be the next LeveLord" people into sweating their asses off into competing with each other to make a winning level.<p>Worse than losing right to the work (which would happen if these people were employed instead, anyway), there's no real tangible resume developed.<p>RickNeff, your experience was at a time when map editing was far less widespread. Now editors are being included with the game when you buy it. The competition is a lot greater under these conditions.<p>This contest and the recent S3 contest both ask for more than just submitting a map -- these contests require you to work like hell <B>specifically to provide the entry, which would be of no use to anyone anywhere else</B>.<p>Imagine if someone told you they'd give you a lucrative prize if you won a different kind of contest -- you have to spend a week digging ditches. So you and a hundred other saps dig ditches for this slacker, and then 99 of you walk away with absolutely nothing to show for it.<p>Of course later this bum might decide he likes your ditch as well, so be sure to sit at home by the phone in case fortune smiles upon you after all.<p>These contests should be ignored on principle... or maybe not. Maybe whenever one is announced everyone should send a scathing e-mail flame as their submission.<p>MD<br></div></td></tr>

<HR>Acctually i was going to post that last night but decided against it. Just made no sense. The prize sucks (IMHO) for such an insane amount of work. The only reason I could see todo it would be to have a team work on it, and then use the rights to the engine to produce a game.

<HR>Hrm.  This is crap.  Man.  this belongs on <a href=http://www.planetcrap.com>Planetcrap</a>!<p>Well, I remember monolith doing some wierd form of contest like this for shogo.  They let you get a beta copy of the lithtech and the editor.  You had to make a dm level using lith tech and the winning entrants got  some sorta prize(forgot what it was) and the level appeared in the game with full credit.  Although I believe that Monolith kept the rights to the level you made.  That contest didn't bother me since all you had to do was make a level.  Not a big deal.  Actually I don't even know if they ever finished the contest or not.  <p>But this shiznit with Hawksoft is lame.  I would no way create 4 models, all new textures AND 2 levels just so I could have a limited license of an engine that I (personally) have never heard of.  I bet there are people reading that post and think that if they do all that stuff, they will for sure have a job in the industry.  And I have a feeling that Hawk wouldn't give them a job after that(even though someone to do all that and do it good is worth soemthing. Especially in 6 wks.)  Just sounds really shady to me.<p>Oh yeah, why have I NEVER heard of these guys before?<p>Ian<P>------------------<BR><b>bs2000</b><br> <A HREF="mailto:ian@planetquake.com">ian@planetquake.com</A> </div></td></tr>

This sucks!"  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/wink.gif"><p>To start with, I certainly wouldn't be entering this contest, nor would I expect too many others to.<p>However,  I'm sorry - If someone is able to make a contest out of digging ditches and still get people to enter, well...something along the lines of natural selection weeding out the weak and stupid comes to mind.  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif">  And, if a company is able to do get people to enter, well again, I'm sorry, I simply don't see what the problem is.<p>Granted, a lot of people will work their little butts off in any contest - yet most won't walk away with a thing.  And in almost ANY contest that creates a tangible product, the creator often walks away with the rights to the end result. IMHO, it's simply the way contests work.<p>Of course, I think it's a moot point - I seriously doubt too many people are going to enter such a contest - considering there really isn't even a tangible prize.  Which helps to prevent such contests that require a lot of work for no real reward.<p>And that, IMHO, again is the whole natural selection process at work.  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/biggrin.gif"><p><P>------------------<BR>Richard Neff<br> <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/dmm2editor" TARGET=_blank>http://members.aol.com/dmm2editor</A> </div></td></tr>

<HR>Ah hah!<br>I see now.<p>I kinda did a bone head post last time.<br>Went to their page and it turns out that they want levels not for a game, but for a demo to showcase the engine to prospective buyers/whoever is interested.  Still kinda funky if you ask me.  Hell, for all we know it could be one guy in his house and all he has time to do is write the code for an engine, and none to make levels to show off the game.  <p>Still wouldn't be one of the contests I enter..oh well.<p>ian<p><p></div></td></tr>

<HR>RickNeff:<br>Normally I would agree with you, if someone is stupid enough to do something equally stupid, hell it proves Darwin lives and it just means there's more left over for me. <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>But for me, this attitude doesn't extend to kids (under the age of 15-16). I <I>really don't</I> like seeing kids victimized by adults. It pisses me off.<p>But I think regardless of outlook, the conclusion that guys like this are cheap bastard scumbags still stands.<br>MD<br></div></td></tr>

<HR>Just my 2 cents,<p>First, because of copyright law reasons, you cannot call something YOUR property because someone submitted it in a contest.  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"> So if they want to make money over your hard work, and they want to do that, it's illegal if they don't pay you<p>second, who wants a license for their 3D engine? there are a lot floating around the net and some are bad but a lot are very good.<p>third: people should be aware of the fact that they get ripped off. I live in the netherlands/europe and I simply don't fly to the USA just because some shitcompany used my work and I definitely won't start a $$$$ lawsuite just because I'm not able to miss a day here at work  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"> <p>Just ignore them, critize them to death. It's hard for a gamecompany these days to survive if you don't have a killergame. <p>Bankruptcy for all rippers! (and yes if you read this, australian assh*le that stole my music: this counts for you too!)<p><P>------------------<BR><b>Frans 'Otis' Bouma</b><br>Senior Software Engineer at Solutions Design:<br> <A HREF="http://www.sd.nl" TARGET=_blank>http://www.sd.nl</A> <br>Otis' officially downloadpage for all his (xm)musicmods:<br> <A HREF="http://www.xs4all.nl/~perseus" TARGET=_blank>http://www.xs4all.nl/~perseus</A> </div></td></tr>
