<HR>Tigger-oN emailed me the following bit of email for discussion purposes, so lets discuss...  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>--- At 0431 PM 1/10/99 +1100, Tigger-oN wrote<p>before i get any further, plz let me tell u all a few things<br>1, this is not meant to upset anyone<br>2, this is *education* in my eyes (ie. the sharing of knowledge)<br>3, feel free to flame me, a heated discussion on this subject could be good!<br>4, i've been making game levels since doom2, i do know a bit about them,<br>not everything, but a bit ]<br>5, the base pc for Half-Life is NOT a pII450 running 2 Voodoo2, and<br>software mode is part of the game that a lot of ppl use<br>6, i'm a really bad speller ]<p>ok........<p>this is not targeted and radium, nor is it to be seen as an insult (to him<br>or anyone else), i think radium (and crew) have, and still are doing a<br>great job of reviewing levels, however i and a few *others* (mainly lan<br>players) have many problems with the highly ranked levels associcated with<br>radiums web site and feel that it this could be damaging the game, not<br>helping it. Not everyone has high end pc's, alot only have the base system<br>remeber. a lot of ppl are seeing *errors* in the levels that radium has<br>give scores of 80+ to, (see screen shots for examples)<p>i've attached 3 images (.gifs with a very small colour count to keep file<br>size down) [note - images have been linked at end of message], plz <br>have a look at them, they are screen shots of x-fire, pipes and dante_1. <br>although x-fire didn't get such a high score on radium's review system, i <br>do think it was worth including.<p>basically i think the *high praise* for levels that the HL game engine can<br>not handle is not *reallistic* (HL is a hotted up version of quake<br>remember). within these levels, there is just way too much infomation being<br>pumped around, and this is without anyone else running around on the level<br>or over the net!<p>a note for the level makes, as HL is based on the quake engine, using<br>software mode to test your levels is a good idea. the GL section of quake<br>was a add-on, not part of the original idea. also things like r_draworder<br>can be used in software<p>plz feel free to discuss this with anyone, and do what u wish with the<br>images included and this email.<p>if anyone has any questions/comments/flames/prasie/spelling corrections,<br>plz forward to the hole group involed, lets keep this open, and maybe<br>something really good could come from it ], also plz forward to anyone<br>else that you think could benifit from this infomation/discussion<p>if you don't wish to be involed. plz let everyone know as i've *guessed*<br>who might be interested in this subject<p>thanx, and i really hope i didn't upset too many ppl, its just that i<br>really love the game, and level construction!<p>[images moved to the Half-Life ERC server...]<p>http://halflife.gamedesign.net/misc/x-fire0002.gif<br>http://halflife.gamedesign.net/misc/dante_10000.gif <br>http://halflife.gamedesign.net/misc/pipes0001.gif <p>Tigger-oN<br>_________________________<br>planethalflife.com/tigger<br>tigger@planethalflife.com <p>

<HR>Not targeted at me?  Heh.  Nice try, but you aint foolin' nobody TiggerOn.   <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif">  I do appreciate your well thought-out comments, so I will try to provide an answer of equal worth.<p>First off, Im not a mapper.  The points in your email may be of concern to mappers.  They are not of much concern to me or the majority of players.<p>Second of all, note that whoever it was that said that a P2-450 is a base system was certainly not me.<p>I simply provide a site where players can download Half-Life maps which are accompanied by my or someone elses opinions of that level after playing it.  I CLEARLY state several times that they are editorials and that I do not claim to be an authority on maps.<p>I do this site because I dont believe people should blindly have to download maps.  I downloaded hundreds of Quake2 levels, of which I only kept a few.  I decided I would do a site that not only offers maps in a central location, but that reflects >MY< thoughts on the maps offered.<p>As I said, I am not a mapper.  TiggerOn pointed out several things in his screenshots of which I (nor most players) have little or no use for.  As he said, this is due to non-education...  Including myself.<p>As far as Im concerned, this stuff is of use to mappers only.  The average player does not use this information.  Im willing to try to change that though, keep reading.<p>I appreciate TiggerOn's efforts to show me that the levels I enjoy playing are indeed flawed.  However, this does not change the fact that I indeed enjoyed these levels.<p>Before posting this, I started Gamespy and listed servers.  There are at this moment seven x-fire servers, three dante_1 servers, and four pipes servers.<p>Personally I wouldnt play dante_1 online.  Its only value is really LAN play, for which it rocks.  This is MY opinion.  You may not like it, but on my LAN we like it.  This map has terrible r_speeds, and runs slow except on high-end machines.  I mentioned this in my review several times, and even on the news page.<p>X-Fire is a fun map.  This is MY opinion.  I dont care if x-fire is flawed, I enjoy playing this map.  So do many others.  You go join a server and tell everyone having a great time playing x-fire that they should not play this map because it is flawed.  See what reply you get.  Did you know there is an x-fire clan?  They dont care about flaws either, they like the map.<p>Pipes.  Again, in MY opinion... a fun map.  Yes it has high r_speeds.  Yes, I mentioned that several times in my review.  Yes, I still like it, and so do others.<p>I appreciate that as mappers, you guys can spot a flawed level.  The majority of players are not concerned with these flaws nor are they aware of them.  If someone wishs to go through all my reviews and analyze the maps flaws, you can have your own "Flaws" section for every map.  Im serious, if anyone's interested let me know.  Maybe you would like to do it TiggerOn?  You certainly seem to have enough spare time judging from those fancy screenshots.   <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>I recognize the value of software renderer testing.  However, I simply dont have the time for it.  I spend a very large amount of time on my site.  I do all the HTML, all the CGI, all the graphics, keep up with other reviewers, and work a 60 hour work week to pay my tuition.<p>I play every map extensively (except obvious flops).  By extensively, I mean we play LAN games and I play online with as many people as I can get to join a game.  I simply dont have anymore time to restart HL in a diagnostic mode using the software renderer to look for flaws throughout the entire level.<p>This information is not of substantial value to average players folks.  Most of my email is from people wanting to know why their SLI V2's dont work or how to start HL with the console enabled.  Do you think these guys know what all those developer's terms means?  Nope.  Do you know what question I receive the most?  It's "What is a r_speeds?"  The general public <b>does not know</b> about these things.<p>Now I very much understand why TiggerOn is upset, and I sympathize with him.  I also appreciate that he cares enough to despise me.  Most of you probably feel the same way, but as I said, I never claim to be anything I am not.  I clearly post that my information is opinion.  That is the nature of reviews.<p>Here is my proposition.  My site is popular and gets many visits a day.  If you feel that it is so important to backup the statements TiggerOn made.  Join me.  Ill give put anyone that is experienced enough in control of content in a "Worldcraft" or similar section.  Form a team if you like.  I would love to have people experienced in map making as a part of my site.<p>Common players dont visit editing sites, they visit map sites.  Want to inform the public?  Come on and do it!  If you want to do this, Im dead serious about it.  Post whatever you want.  Tutorials, tips, instructions on testing a level, whatever you want.<p>Im a very dedicated webmaster and Im not against education.  Im willing to promote mapping knowledge if you are.  Perhaps some good can come out of TiggerOn's flaming me!<p>If you do not care enough to contribute, then there is not much to discuss.  Email me at radium@contaminated.net and we can kickoff an editing section for the average player with whatever you want.<p>Thanks</div></td></tr>

<HR>Ok, Tigger, you've really done it now.<p>I'm sorry, autolycus sent me your message and I thought, 'ok, valid argument, but I can explain most of these things'.<p>You've got an email which was nice and polite and reasonable.<br>But I've just seen those gifs you made and those are just RUDE.<br>Not only did you have to voice your opinion, but you had to draw up a gif and categorically destroy every single good thing ever said about my map (and you point every gif to mine, because mine is obviously the worst). I am taking this very personally because this IS a personal attack (on me, x-fire's author and promagnon).<p>You say that dante_1 is not a good map but rather a 'fancy feature-filled level'.<br>Well, tigger, I don't see much innovation in your levels (other than pretty, fast gameplay.)<p>And then you cap off with a half-hearted word that you in fact like my map... COULD'VE FOOLED ME.<p>I don't mind constructive criticism, but when my FIRST work is shown to the entire world as 'HOW NOT TO BUILD MAPS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DESTROY HALFLIFE AS A MULTIPLAYER GAME!'<br>I don't take kindly to it.<p>If you could only see the amount of email I've got with complements about gantry... then well, maybe you'd think a little.<p>Perhaps what hurts me the most is that I emailed you with regards to advice and support in map-making only a couple of days ago and you said that you liked my map (you said it had flaws but you liked it).<p>I realise that r_speeds should be respected but can you forgive a first-time mapper who wanted to experiment ?<p><p><br><P>------------------<BR>Dante </div></td></tr>

<HR>dante_1 is a great 1st map, no problems there, and i used dante_1 as an example, its a great map really, but yer, its got *technical problems*, but as radium points out, most ppl don't worry about that, i guess i'm to much of an *old school level maker*, i like to see good solid constructions across the options of the game (ie software mode and what the game engine can handle). i'm sorry if i've personaly offened you Dante, thats was NOT the goal of the discussion, education on map design, construction and HL game engine capablities was the goal..<p>with that said, let me reply to radium's post <p>*The points in your email may be of concern to mappers. They are not of much concern to me or the majority of players.*<p>no, the point was that you reffer to some maps as *proffession* and as *rasing of standards*, where from a expereinced level makers point of view, the authour has a lot to learn. technically some of the maps have many *flaws* and you have regarded them as *better* then Valves.<p>*I CLEARLY state several times that they are editorials and that I do not claim to be an authority on maps.* <p>yes, i read that too, and the section on how you rank *speed* in your reviews too. yet for some reason a speed score 76, (and a flow score of 91) seems to be really high for a map that can not (realisticaly) be played in software.<p>*I do this site because I dont believe people should blindly have to download maps.*<p>yer, totally agree with you, this is one of the many things i really like about your site. yet i freaked out when i d/loaded *pipes* all 2megs in a zip file! only to start it up and watch the errors, bad design and high framerate chock my cpu to bits. yet you say you don't want to have ppl waste their time and bandwidth d/loading maps that are a waste of time??<br>  <br>*As far as Im concerned, this stuff is of use to mappers only. The average player does not use this information.* <p>maybe so, but they may well ask *why does the sky flash off and on? where did that wall go? why does this map play really jumpy? does HL use unreal networking? yet its not HL, but the level they are playing<p>*Before posting this, I started Gamespy and listed servers...*<p>yes, and where did the server admin get the maps from? radium's website i bet! you don't quite get it do u. your site is offering a very comprehensive view of what is going on in the HL commuinty, u have a very large part to play in what levels are being played on servers. ppl are flocking to your site because u (and your team) review a hell of a lot of levels. to hear *radium* say *Now this is pro material* means a lot, becuase there is not really any other site to cross refferece what radium says. therefore to say that *Now this is pro material* about a map that has *flaws* is a really damaging statement for the game. why? because this is NOT *pro material*. your *opinion* carries a lot of wieght in the HL custom map scene and what you are doing for custom maps is nothing but amazing as far as getting new levels out there, but server admins are putting the maps u *personally* like up, then ppl will play them, ppl will say *man, HL is a laggy game* then will say HL dm sux! this is something i don't think is ture, i think its great and i don't thinks its laggy, but these maps are. (the WON server checking is another issue, don't get me started on that one)<p>*Personally I wouldnt play dante_1 online*<p>u gave it 88 out of 100 the highest score to date, and called it *pro material*??<p>*I recognize the value of software renderer...*<p>to start a game with -dev -console is not hard, u can add it to your hl short-cut (if u have one). it will not effect your game play testing one bit. and to swich to *software mode* takes all of 20 seconds. i do think you are doing a great job on your website, and i do thinks its a *thankless* task sometime, but do keep it up, it looks and works great!<p>*Do you think these guys know what all those developer's terms means?*<p>no, ... but i do think u should, you are the one they are trusting when they d/load a level.<p>*Here is my proposition ...*<p>i'll send u an email radium :]<br><P>------------------<BR>Tigger-oN<br>_________________________<br>planethalflife.com/tigger<br>tigger@planethalflife.com</div></td></tr>

<HR>Sometimes the truth hurts more than a personal attack.  I think Tigger-oN's post is quite valuable to people, mappers and players alike.  <p>Dante, I'm sorry that you took the post as an insult, but as a mapper, when you put your works in the public eye, you *have* to be prepared to accept criticism, especially criticism as specific and constructive as this.  Radium mentioned that this (the Gantry) was professional work, but one of the key traits of a professional is being able to work *within the constraints of the engine*.  <p>A large number of people are using Half-Life's software engine, and yet, the three maps presented here do not work even passably well in software mode - skys, brushes, and entities are all busily popping in and out of existance.<p>Reviewers need to remember, you are reviewing levels, not art.  Levels can and should be reviewed using objective criteria.  A great looking critically flawed level is still a critically flawed level.<br><P>------------------<BR>--<br>Chris 'autolycus' Bokitch<br>Half-Life ERC<br>halflife.gamedesign.net</div></td></tr>

<HR>Over the last few years I have been closely tied in with the development with Worldcraft.  I have seen Quake map design go from a few people beta testing a few level designers to masses of people wanting to get involved!  They see maps on servers and say "Hey!  I can do that!"<p>With the advent of editors like Worldcraft it is very feasible for someone to sit down and start building maps.  However there are many unwritten rules of level design.  I remember the first 2 or 3 maps that I tried to create had to be scrapped due to excessive r-speeds.  I took this as a learning step in the advance of my level design skills and knowledge and went onto the next map.<p>The map makers that have been hired by the companies hopefully have the main attribute required by map makers.  Patience!  I have compiled and recompiled maps over and over again trying to shave off 50 polygons in a troublesome area.<p>I honestly have not seen the levels in question.  However I do have no plans to download any "public" maps.  I have seen far to many first maps which are valiant efforts but really and truly should of been scrapped and left on the map makers hard drive.  Maybe one out of a hundred maps released are high quality professional maps.<p>If your map has excessive rspeeds, it is a failure<p>If your map will not run in Software, it is a failure<p>If your map has visable errors, it is a failure.<p>The true sign of a professional map designer is someone that is willing to bash and fight they map till it gets within the engine limitations.  There is a reason why the guys who do this for a living make the big bucks they do.  IT IS HARD.  On top of that, the other sign is when you know that your map is beyond hope, and its scrapped and you move into another concept.<p>Now lastly, if you have no knowledge of maps and map making, what gives you the gumption to crtique and review maps when you have no idea what you are talking about.  A pretty map allows good looking screen shots to get hits to your webpage.  A good map will stay on peoples harddrives and give them a great deal of challenge.<p>I urge all the young or new mappers out there to rise to the challenge and make a good map.  Do familiarize yourself with the maps that game with the game in question.  In general these maps will push the limitations of the engine to it limits.  If you find yourself making something larger or more complex you are treading on thin ice!<p>Good luck and good speed marine!</div></td></tr>

<HR>As someone who is "forced" by their system configuration to run in software mode this discussion is of great interest. (Hey, some of us have other things to spend our money on besides our computers - food, clothing, shelter, etc. ;-P)<p>I think the the main problem is that many of Half-Life maps coming out are a case of form over function.  <p>I've downloaded pipes and dante_1 - both of them are lovely maps to look at.  Additionally, they are well thought out for their layout, weapon placement, etc..  If I were to rate these maps based solely on their looks and layout I would have to agree with the scores posted on Radium.  In my case, however; playbility is paramount.<p>Both maps, on my system, are constantly plagued by missing textures, sudden slowdowns, etc..  Internet play is impossible with them and even when running lan play these problems crop up far too often to allow the maps to be played enjoyabley.<p>While I'm all for innovation and experimentation by map designers they must keep in mind that people are actually going to end up wanting to play these maps. Most of the people playing them won't be using high end systems.  Heck, I'm pretty certain I'm not the only one using a 166MMX with only 32M of memory and I can only muster 400x300 as playable in sofware mode when on the internet. D3D is a right off when using the internet and even when running single play I can only muster 512x834 max in D3D before the game is unplayable.<p>I've only just started using Worldcraft myself to eate some of my own levels.  I've browsed the net in order to review the various tutorials available in order to try to get a handle on how things work.<p>But one other thing I've also been doing is disassembling the various tutorial maps available.  Each map I've compiled loaded and tested on my system - not only with an eye towards how they work, but also, to how they don't.  It's been quite interesting to go through maps which are slow or experience texture drop out on my system to determine why it is happening. (Side comment - It sure would be nice if more map makers would include their RMF and/or map files when distibuting their BSPs.  I know they all want credit for their work and don't want people taking credit for their maps - but outside of the few tutorial maps currently available there are so few examples which people new to map making can load and disect.  This, at least for me, has always been one of my key methods for learning how to create new levels for almost any game I've used which came with a level editor.)<p>In most instances many of those gee whiz items which make the level look beautiful end up being the same thing which causes the problem.<p>Good map design not only include looks and layout, but also playability on any system configuration.  It seems to be this last factor that many map makers are overlooking in their quest to product that next GEE WHIZ! map.<p>Just remeber - if the map runs well on a low end system its REALLY going to play well on the high end ones.<p>So far, of all the third party multiplayer maps I've tried for Half-Life, Tigger-On's have consistantly been the best.  They may not be the fanciest or have the most bells and whistles but they do have those key factors that make a great map - good texture use, well thought out layout and weapon placement, and most importantly they run at a good speed even on a low end system.<p>While I'm not saying that there isn't room for improvement I do feel that Tigger-On's maps would be good basic examples for many map designers to look at when designing their next map.<P>------------------<BR>---<br>When life kicks you in the teeth see your dentist immidiately. :-)</div></td></tr>

<HR>Ive already addressed most of the points raised in these replies in my first post.  Like I said, I give ample warning everytime a map has high r_speeds.<p>I dont agree with the statement that:<br>"If your map has excessive rspeeds, it is a failure, If your map will not run in Software, it is a failure, If your map has visable errors, it is a failure."<p>Thats funny.  Thats more of an opinion than the things I post!  Like I said, most people dont  care about those things.  YOU care, but youre a mapper.<p>Im sorry but I just dont get any mails asking about errors in maps.  Most people dont see them.<p>I will start doing this annoying software testing despise my hate for software rendering.  I will post whatever errors I find at the end of the review, but this will not effect my opinion of a fun map regardless of what you insist.<br></div></td></tr>

<HR>First off, I think that despite the moderately heated nature of discussions like this, they are valuable in too many ways to be censored or ignored. Secondly, one of the unfortunate things about this kind of thing is that the people involved all have valid and important points - it's not so much a question of who's right or wrong, but that the topic at hand can be approached from many different perspectives and not everyone sees or values the same piece of the whole.<p>Okay, enough diplomacy.<p>I haven't made a HalfLife map yet - at least, not one I'd dare release; I wouldn't waste a reviewers time nor that of anyone who might be trolling the net for maps. As Somberfire said, making maps (playable, quality maps) is hard, and what one person considers to be a good map may be seen as garbage by someone else. The point is, not everyone does what they do for the same reason.<p>Radium provides an invaluable service for any map hunter - even if you or I disagrees with his reviews, he provides enough information about the map so that we can make some sense of a judgement ourselves whether the map is worth our time or not. His criticism is not overly harsh, and he does at times provide advice for the map maker in question, or for anyone who would attempt this task. I think his goal (or what I believe it to be) - to provide a clearinghouse for maps and give people some sense of the content and quality of a map, and to save us time, is a good one and he does it well.<p>As for Tigger, I personally loved his first map, so much so that I made a point of remembering who the author was so I could grab his next creation...it was FUN, and from the perspective of someone wanting to HAVE fun, any flaws or whatnot that exist are easily overlooked. Very very few maps out there, those made by people in the spare time at any rate, are of what Somberfire might consider professional quality - and I would have to agree; but the ratings system is not the same for everyone. Is it technically brilliant, is the architecture flawless? No? Is it fun as hell? Alright!<p>So you have the players and the reviewers, but then you have the map makers themselves - and even then I'm sure there are different motivations for everyone, but for myself, I want to take an idea, realize it and do it in a way that is hopefully fun, of high quality and might get me some measure of recognition; and if making the map is hard enough, I just might learn something.<p>I've made maps for Doom2, Duke3d, Quake/Quake2, Unreal and now HalfLife - have I released any of these on the net? No way - I know that making a really good map is hard work, and if you bcome known for producing crap, then your maps might not get looked at after a while. This is how the net works - word travels fast and to a degree you must have a sense of responsibility for what you send out into the great void. My friends say my maps are great, but I have different standards - as do we all.<p>Map your maps. Review the maps. Play the maps - but remember not everyone does what they do for different reasons, and that means that your motivations are not any more rightthan someone elses. Live and let live.<p>Well, until I see you on the other end of my shotgun - or till you slag my map.  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>Anthrage - The Longwinded One</div></td></tr>

<HR>Hmm... this topic seems like some sort of exclusive webmaster club that I don't belong in, but WTF, I have opinions.<p>I am but a pebble next the boulders that are professional map makers, (I'm hard at work on my 3rd map since Doom right now!) and think everyone here has valid points. I totally agree with Tigger-On about the lack of professionalism in user-made maps (mine included), but I also agree with Radium that there's something to be said for just ENJOYING a map. I was disappointed in pipes and I haven't played the gantry yet, but I LOVE x-fire. That is one of the most fun maps I've ever played on. Is it flawed? Hell yeah it's flawed, I even got kicked off a server yesterday because the map was so flawed. But you know what? I'm going to go back and play it some more because it's a damn fun map!<p>Now that I've defended Radium, I'll defend Tigger-On... I would like to see more professionalism in user made maps, and I feel kinda bad for releasing my first map... it plays well and the speed isn't bad, but I'm not happy with the look of the architecture, and for that reason, I wouldn't want to play on it. I suppose that's bad of me to say about my own map, but it's true.<p>Anyway, I'm hoping my new map will redeem me (r_speeds average about 250 right now and never get about 500) that way, if the only solution to this problem is a mass extermination of bad mappers, I'll be able to keep on mapping!! =)<p>Just my humble views...</div></td></tr>

<HR>I am also one of those people forced to use software rendering.  It is nice when a level looks perfect in software, but to me and my friends, gameplay is more important.<p>Last night I managed a small LAN game.  My system, and two others.  (Damn weather.)  Here are the systems we used:<p>K6 233 MHz, 32MB RAM, CI S3 ViRGE.  320x240 software.<p>PIIC333A @ 416 MHz, 128 MB RAM, 4MB PCI ATI All-in-Wonder Pro.  640x480 software (until ATI makes OpenGL drivers that don't mess up blood and decals.)<p>Dual PII350 @ 375 MHz, 256 MB RAM, Creative Labs V2 SLI.  OpenGL 1024x768.  (He also has a huge SCSI stripe on Cheetahs!  :-9~~)<p>Not once did the issue of speed or missing surfaces come up during the 2 hours we played on X-Fire.  OK, I lied.  Near the end the V2 owner was slowing a bit, but I've noticed that on V1/2 systems with several thousand decals.  There was too much fun going on to worry about the sky flickering a bit, or walls on the far end disappearing.  Even the K6 ran the level speedily.  Surface errors did not detract from our experience at all, your milage may vary.<p>I downloaded and checked out Gantry in single player to get a feel, and we agreed not to play it.  Not that we felt there was anything wrong, the lost surfaces in software were not a concern, but it just wasn't our "kind" of level.  To each their own right?<p>In the past, I've had a P166 (non-MMX) V1 system on the LAN and it could hardly run anything other than Datacore.  Any sort of open area, such as BattleField, slowed the system to about 5-7 FPS.  This is unfortunate, but the only choice for a system like that is small, closed in levels and we don't like those as much.<p>In conclusion, surface errors to not seriously affect gameplay for me or my friends.  Neither do texture errors with the exception of "transparent" grating with the blue instead of clear.  X-Fire, Gantry, and others would be better maps if these errors were not present;  however, the existance of these errors does not make them bad maps.<p>Jon McIlwaine</div></td></tr>

<HR>Woahhhhhh  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif">))  what a fun exchange  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif">)<p>And since this is a mappers forum, I'm gonna stick to the mappers aspects here  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>I think the specifics and personal defenses/attacks here are kinda hiding a point.<p>The point is, that making dm maps that run great in half Life are many times harder than in Q2.<p>Remember in Q2 how we used to add hint brushes and areaportals, to disguise that area that was high r_speed??  well now we cant do it, so we have to add additional skills in map making for half Life that we could conveniently forget in Q2 and disguise.<p>Actually, thats not additional skills, its going back to the basics of good design, good build and good sense.<p>Half Life is hard, its a trade off, its a trade between eye-candy and frame-rate,  a trade between Gl and software, and its a trade between work and acceptance.<p>You have to WORK at producing a good map.  I did things in a Q2 map which just wont work in H/L because you cant hide them, you cant retreat into a comfort zone of Hint Brushes, or slap a doorway in a hall to cut off two areas (I Know I've tried)  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>This means, to me at least, that a good Half-Life map has many more additional criteria than a Q2 map did.<p>I accept that a lot of "flawed" maps are going to be enjoyed so much they are going to be played regardless, but surely, it would be so much better if the map were not flawed, but still played as well??  Doesn't the player of these maps feel a little cheated, even through their enjoyment??<p>At the moment, I have an outside area in my map which registers 850 on r_speed...  I'm not prepared to give that area up, and I'm not prepared to release it over 750 (and would prefer 700), so i have to work at it to save those speeds.  No-one may ever know how much work, but to me its vital.  Its also vital to me to know that others have been through the same process, otherwise, its a no-go.<p>Likewise, I think its important to recognise the limitations of the engine, and prove you can build within those limitations, and I think that the builder that has accomplished this should be rewarded.<p>How many people have built their map, bit by bit, and then looked at the r_speeds and said.. OK, now I know what I want to build, and started from a clean editor and built the whole map again from scratch but built it to match the final design??  Very few, but its a sure way generally of shaving off some r_speeds, and eliminating some flaws.  Over the top??  yes probably, but how much worth do you place on your responsability to the people that may have paid in phone charges to download your creation??<p>R_speeds are not the God of creation here, but they are one of the rules, and the mappers who play by the rules should be rewarded.<p>Bottom Line,   if you release a map, then its going to cost people something to get it, in most parts of the world, in call charges, and probably in on-line playing time..  do you respect that or not??<p>Moria<P>------------------<BR>   <A HREF="http://www.colony.co.uk" TARGET=_blank>www.colony.co.uk</A>   <br>Terraforming the Internet</div></td></tr>

<HR>"People should be more considerate of player's computers when designing maps. Framerate is king." (Tamahome, Radium map reviewer, "Sands of Sorrow")<p>A very valid message has been posted outside of this thread. Ironically it seems to be the one most ON topic. Its headed as `Mappers and Reviewers' or something to that effect. It is to my humble opinion that perhaps the past few messages have strayed a little off topic. While they are valid, I thought that this thread was "a discussion of highly rated yet flawed maps and their possible effects on the mapmaking and gameplaying communities" (Autolycus). Yet people are talking about how to make good maps. While valid and very useful I think it is still best that these be done in a separate thread.<p>Also, I would like to clarify Radium's stand on the matter regarding exactly how he goes about reviewing maps. In the beginning, as I recalled, a very objective system was planned and implemented whereby a map was evaluated via certain categories. The score for each of these categories would then be averaged to give the final result. Also, you explained your harsh rating system as being necessary for the weeding out of `beginner' type maps that are sure to flourish in the initial stages of the game.<p>I couldn't have been happier! Immediately after I read that your site was in my bookmarks. I also sent the first HalfLife map I made (after tweaking and testing for damn near 2 weeks) to you for a review. I took all the scores you did for gospel truth.<p>It is sad, though, that the workings of the world do not allow for intent and consequence to be one and the same. The most alarming inconsistency I spotted was in the `speeds' category. For example, and Radium himself has stated, that Dante_1 is a power hungry map. Yet he has given it a speed rating of 76. Lets look at `Darn'. With a lower r_speeds rate you'd think that the score would be higher. NO. Darn had a speed rating of 38. I urge everyone to go see for themselves and confirm it, a little dilligence and you'll find alot of them.<p>But later he changed your stand somewhat from being an objective reviewer to a people's representative. To every other arguement brought up he gives the justification that "that means nothing to me, a player. that only means something to you, a mapper". I think the posts have adequately answered that IMHO, so I shall not mention it any further. He also justifys with "but nobody complains about it. Everyone agrees and has fun with my highly rated maps", and "nobody gives a damn about mapper terminology". In the first place let me tell you that as a mapper I am also an avid player, and this mapper player differenciation should not be split up so as to cause unnecessary conflict. Also, these obscure `terms' all have real world consequences, or else we wouldnt bother. So this obscure `r-speeds' command while not understood by the average gamer, will still MAKE ITS PRESENCE FELT to him and is thus relevant.<p>Finally, his most recent stand, as stated on his news update, is that he is a purely subjective reviewer i.e. his opinions are his alone, and since everyone is entitled to their opinions he shouldn't be accountable for anything he says. If that is his stand then it is game over. We will all stop this and leave him to his own opinions. I for one, however, will cease to take his site seriously, and would also request for him to remove his judging criteria section as it misleadingly suggests him to be objective.<p>So, Radium, I would like to clarify. Are you an objective reviewer? If so please do not use the opinions or lack of, of the masses as basis for any form of justification.  Are you the people's reviewer? If so please leave map ratings up for public voting, instead of assinging ratings yourself. Are you a subjective reviewer? If so please remove the judging criteria section as it suggests otherwise. Most importantly, please clarify your stand and do not switch between stands as is convenient because it is confusing.<p>BTW.. software flaws aside, lets look at the design flaws of Dante_1. Flaws that every person should be able to notice. It was said that the lip at the side of every platform is high enough not to allow the person to fall off yet low enough to remain unobtrusive. While running through the map, I strafed to the side to see if it was true... SPLAT. The ladders leading up to the rocket launcher have texture problems.  And I wonder if I was the only person to notice the half-embedded shotgun on the bottom floor that nobody is able to get without noclipping. All these were noticed by me in the first running of the map. It was very confusing indeed to have heard that this is a raising of the standards or that it is Valve quality.<p>Most of all, I wish to issue a sincere plea to radium to please do not see any evil in what we say, just because we are criticising. From your first reply to Tigger, and also based on the mails I received from you, I get certain vibes that perhaps you see anything bad said about you or your site as a flame. This is bad because you automatically become vey defensive and close yourself off to any opinions. Worse still, I am getting vibes that you may just be totally closed to all opinion. I appreciate your move of calling for map editors join you, but judging from the changes made so far on your site it seems very likely that us map editors will probably only get a separate page of `hints and tips', and not effect the overall rating altogether, which is the point to the whole thing in the first place. As such, I foresee none of us actually volunteering in the end for your PR job. I also appreciate your agreement to test new maps out on software mode, but I am quite disappointed at the `your points are unfair but I'll do it just to make you happy' insincere feel to it. In the first place, I still don't see the difficulty involved with testing the maps in software mode. The thing can be done in less than a  few minutes. On top of that, I have a very naggy feeling that you will not go back and re-review the maps concerned to amend the scores, seeing that none of the scores have ever been amended despite any comments.<p>No matter what is said, Radium, please remember that a man will never tell another to jump out of the way of an incoming car, risking the warning as being taken as an insult to his eyesight or otherwise, if he didn't care for him. My humble advice is, stick to your original plan of holding out on good reviews until the good maps arrive, it certainly was an initiative that had my utmost respect.<p>To all please forgive my English if it is flawed. thank you.</div></td></tr>

<HR>Since my last post I figured I would add a few more comments that I either left out or were brought up by other people.  <p>I will start with Radium since he seems to the center of this thread.  I really do feel that you should be able review maps your own way.  With your own balancing acts of what is the most important to you.<p>I do feel that if you add a pass through all the levels with the Software Rendered that overall your reviews and webpages will become better.  However more important that the software rendered is r-speeds.  Please for the sake of the entire community turn on your r_speeds command while reviewing the maps.  Honestly Im not sure what the "acceptable upper limit" is for Half-Life, but considering how attached this engine is to Quake and Quake 2, I bet the 650 rule will work here.  If you ever see rspeeds of twice the limit you must realize that on your average joe's computer they will be taking a huge performance hit.  When they round that corner, it really does feel like your are running through syrup.  <p>As a reviewer you do have a responsibility to the community, mostly to the map makers.  If you give some maps artificially high marks then the mapper will not learn, and will not try to improve.  If they then try to apply for a job with maps with huge and out of control rspeeds they will get a reaction akin to a woman pointing and laughing.<p>Now to simplify, to the rest of you mappers that have posted in this thread.  Do keep up the effort, never stop trying to improve your maps.  R_speeds are key.  I will play a decent looking fast map, where I will not play a beautiful yet slow map.<P>------------------<BR>Brian "Somberfire" Smedley<br>ACD Systems LTD,<br>Head of Game Utility Design</div></td></tr>

<HR>some one ubove said that they thaught that you couldnt do as much in half life as in q1 or q2 as far as the frame rate and r_speeds go...<br>i think you can do more... the problem is mappers trying to do too much...eather to show off or becouse they think the half life game will support it...<br>first thing to remember when making h.l. multy player levels is that the game runs a lot slower on the net than q2 or q1 thats the way it is... i play on a server that runes both q2 and half life and my ping on the hl server is 100-200ms higher and its the same physical server<p>now... people see all those realy big dm maps that came with half life and say wow i can do that too...in my oppinion 1 of the maps that came with half life... i think it was bounce<br>... shouldnt have eaven shipped with the game<br>i run a 233/64 meg /3dfx machine and that map is unplayable to me...<br>and with bad r_speed eating monsters like that for insperation what do you expect?<p>also as far as i know all the same efects that are available in single player half life are also avalable in multy player...now you get realy tempted to throw in all kinds of cool efects that may run ok on your machine at home or on your office lan...but on the net they suck   <br>eaven thow half life is based on the q1 engine mapping for it is a lot differant...<br>i think there was a mad rush to get levels out there by very inexperianced mappers...<br>and people that wanted to show of there tech skilzz...but...zzzz...zzz..zz.. a realy technicale map that runs like excrement is just a waist of time...<p>in then next few months you will see the good maps starting to come out,,, from all the mappers that took the time to make good levels... then radium will need to change its scale from 0 - 100 to 0 -300...wait and see...<br>oh and whome regestered with my planet quake e mail...??? that pisses me off<br>nat<br></div></td></tr>

<HR>First excuse my broken english - sounds german? Yes, your right.<br>I must admit, that a well designed map WILL become rubbish, if r_speeds drops into nothingness. Otherwise a fast map with clean hallrooms is pretty uncool. As mentioned in earlear posts, the mapper has to find a compromise.<br>Now to the point, that slow, flawing maps destroy the mapping-scene and the game itself. That sounds a little bit crazy to me, cause without these "flawing-first-user-maps" there would be NO scene and (nearly) no DM-fun.<p>Yes, my first HLmap "X-Fire" is VERY slow...so what? It was my very first try to handle the sensitive HL-engine.<br>No one forces you to play "X-Fire".<br>Enjoy it or not. Hudson, sod and many other like the map and that is, in the end, the only important fact - that someone has fun with a usermap (sorry for repeating).<p>P.S. Be sure to check out my upcoming map "Malice" that will be (ttrt!) much faster than "X-Fire"  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/wink.gif"><p><br>cyNic<P>------------------<BR></div></td></tr>

<HR>First of all wargecko... yes Im sensitive to bad opinions because Im trying to please everyone and thats not possible.  If I didnt give a damn, I wouldnt be watching this thread nor would I have replied to any of your emails.<p>Originally my site was a simple one page thing.  The sort of page everyone whips up and posts on Geocities or some other crap.  I put out a call for people interested in developing such a site, and got hosted at contaminated way back in the very beginning. <br>I asked everyone what they wanted to see.  I got TONS of response.  So I spent two months designing my site based on input via mail and about a dozen players who gave feedback on my message board daily.<p>My site is unique in the way that I deal with the riskiness of doing things in-depth.  The reason no one does this is because of the discussion on this thread.  It takes alot of work.  Alot.  And now Ive upset a small faction of the community.<p>Now, apparently from wargecko's post, people have come to the conclusion that my site is to be some authoritive dropoff for maps and some ultimate ranking of their worth.<p>If this is what people really think of my site, and if this is what people want... Im willing to make it that.  But, currently that is not the intention.<p>So wargecko, if you really want my site to be transformed into what you first thought it was and should be... I extend the same invitation to you as I did to TiggerOn to join me.  Im willing to make it more than just a section on editing, but what Im telling you is I need help to do this!  Im already doing what I can, so if you really care that much, help me go the rest of the way.<p>We can spend all the time you want devising a real system on which to judge maps and make it an actual ranking for the masses instead of just a ranking of opinions.  <b>If thats what you really want</b>.<p>I am willing to re-assess every single review with whatever new system we devise.<p>Im not a bad guy.  You know Im open to suggestions and Im hard working.  I put in many hours a day on my site.<p>However, Im not all-knowing and Im not perfect.  If you really want to see my site be what you think it should be then help me make it that way, otherwise there is no way I cater to you alone.<br></div></td></tr>

<HR>Radium, once again I must apologise, for it seems that my English is even worse than I thought. Everyone please do not "come to the conclusion that (Radium's) site is to be some authoritive dropoff for maps and some ultimate ranking of their worth". It is not what I meant. It is enough for me to crawl back to my little country and not speak again. Before I do so, I leave a last message, I'll put it in point form so I don't screw it up:<p>- subjective reviewer, objective reviewer, people's reviewer<br>- you cannot be all of them. they conflict and cause confusion (pls refer to prev msg)<br>- please clarify which one r u?<p>- a lot of effort & feedback - i understand and have always appreciated<p>- we are a minority whose opinions likewise reflect only that of the minority "small faction of the community"- is that really true?<p>- "If that is what you really want" - not the point - not what I want nor what Tigger or the others want - not misleading the people - so much room for improvement of the map, why give such high score?<p>- YES to agreeing to help. NO to helping your site. - after all discussion, you have proposed great changes, but you havent moved an inch to understanding WHY - forsee a whole future of disputes<p>- would much rather help another person develop ANOTHER review site - with 2 sites people can choose - solve alot of problems.<p>Thats basically all I have left to say, nothing more. If there are any persons out there interested in running a map review site and need assistance please let me know. I really don't know why Radium wanted me to help him in his site when I can't even send an idea through correctly, but if u can forgive that then I am your man. My contact e-mail is attached to this post. Thank you.<p><br></div></td></tr>

<HR>Okay, I'm going to wade into this dispute <deep breath><p>First, many of us agree that lag is a problem inherent in the HL engine.  This is in the process of being fixed. However, people seem to delight in slamming maps for being "laggy".  I surf all the servers on my 56.6 and I admit, many maps run like parapalegic dogs.  But that's my point...A lot of maps (even those created by Valve) run quite poorly over the net.<p>So, while I agree that some maps are poorly constructed (for whatever reasons), lag is not nessessarily the authors fault. Dante_1 is a great map (and I mean that).  I agree that the architecture hurts speeds.  However, how much of this is the map, and how much is the game?  We need to see what the 1.000.7 code changes do to netplay before we start ragging on people.<p>Now, let me touch on r_speeds.<br>I understand (and so do many others in the community and industry)  that not everyone has a PII 450 chugging away on there desk.  However, and forgive me for sounding callous, shouldn't those that have such beasts be able to play maps that utilize their systems full potential?  Plus, with new technologies like the TNT and V3, and as existing accelerators achieve better market penetration, people will be able to play on more advanced maps.<p>Finally, I think that TiggerOn and autolycus have pointed out something very important;  Do we mappers bother to check our maps under all conditions?  I confess I don't.  If it plays ok on my K6-2 350 in Voodoo2 mode, then I say it's allright.I went through Dante_1 in Voodoo mode and never noticed any of the problems that TiggerOn pointed out.  From now on, I'm going to be a lot more careful about checking my maps under varying resolutions and rendering modes.  It's something we should all remember.<p>BTW, if anyone finds problems in our maps such as those tigger has found in dante_1.bsp, please e-mail the RAS webmaster at webmaster@radioactivesoftware.com.  We'll do our best to fix glitches we're told about find (if it's fixable).<p></div></td></tr>

<HR>wargecko...<br>Your language seems quite coherent to me.  Perhaps you just arent willing to back up your words.  Anyways, I will once again address your comments.<p>- I post my own objective comments on maps.<p>- By minority, I was referring to the map makers who are educated in the technical merit of the map making skill.  Surely they are a minority, as only a half-dozen people have complained about technical mis-sights in my reviews at all.<p>- I havent moved an inch?!  Ive admitted that TiggerOn is correct, and that my site fails to consider technical aspects of a maps construction in my reviews to which I, and the majority of the public, are not aware.  Ive proposed changes, suggested remedies, and asked for help.  What exactly is it you want?<p>- Instead of trying to remedy the situation, you merely go so far as to launch a personal attack on me and say youd rather help another site?  That makes alot of sense.  Good luck finding someone with the dedication to do what Ive done so far.  If you do, Ill cheer for you both.<p>I really dont see what you want of me wargecko.  Ive offered to ammend the situation, and in response you cower into a corner and hide behind your language.<p>If you guys are blowing hot air, than you really have nothing to complain about.  The vast majority of people love the site, and I can surely continue on with my site just as it is and keep getting 3k visits a day.  I am merely trying to accomodate you guys and improve the information I provide.  But if you cant assist me, I cant assist you, and your complaints are effectively diminished.<br></div></td></tr>

<HR>Sam Shahrani aka Samurai, your point that ppl with highend pcs should be able to benfit from them is a really dodgy thing to say. its like saying *i have car that can go at 250km/h (i have no idea what that is in miles) and i should be able to drive at that speed*. i think a map should be tested and be able to be played on the base pc up - without errors. the benfit from having high end equipment in my eyes is NOT so u can play badly designed levels, but so that u can play well made ones at a much higher framerate (ie, much smoother)<p>*BTW, if anyone finds problems in our maps such as those tigger has found in dante_1.bsp, please e-mail...* <p>i would like to think that after reading this disscussion that u should be able to find the errors your self, esp. if u are making a mod, a little bit of info about the game engines' limits should be the 1st thing u learn. however if u would like me to have a look at any levels, post a url of where i can d/load them.<br><P>------------------<BR>Tigger-oN<br>_________________________<br>planethalflife.com/tigger<br>tigger@planethalflife.com</div></td></tr>

<HR>By opting to work for another site I was coming up with the best alternative for all parties in my opinion: to let the people have a portfolio of views, and to get us off your back since most of the disagreements seem to stem from the fact that you are the only voice that is heard in the map reviewers world. There was no backing off, no cowering. I don't see how diminished helping another site is as it will still help the community.<p>What has to be said has been said. I really have no control over how you interpret my words, Radium, and I also see that my contributions will only lock you in angry responses to me while you ignore the other posts. I am thus bailing out on this discussion, and its probably unrealistic to expect you to understand. "Coward", "full of hot air", I will have no problems about you  having the last word.</div></td></tr>

<HR>I think Radiums site is excellent, but I will never take a reviewers word as truth - if you go and see a movie, how many reviews do you read about it first ? - Just one ?<br>Ok, sure, there is only one (as far as I know) HL review site out there at the moment, but we all have our own opinions, right ?<p>The reviews are Radiums opinion, you don't have to agree with them.<p>I know how hard it is to run a site, and also how difficult it is to make a decent level.<p>I've made about 50 levels over the past three to four years - for Doom2, Quake & Quake2 and have only ever released one of them. I sent it to various review sites, but it never got looked at - I was hoping for criticism, or even an email in reply - I got nothing, and that hurt more than anything else. I'll still carry on trying, as I enjoy creating levels - people enjoyed playing that level on the quake2 server I connect to, and that's good enough for me.<p>The vast majority of people who play games, do not care how they are made - and certainly don't give two hoots about r_speeds - what they do care about, however, is smooth and fun gameplay.<p>It's up to the level designer to provide that - and also to care about things like r_speeds.<p>What is an acceptable value for r_speeds ?<br>That's a hard question to answer, but as in all things in the PC industry, the value is climbing. <p>For Quake, the top level designers worked around a value of 400, trying not to go above that, for Quake2 some top level designs had areas of 700 - but only in low traffic areas.<p>How far do we go ? - we know that not everyone has a top end PC with hardware that can handle high r_speeds, so it's a case of balancing between the two - a tradeoff of eye-candy vs speed & fun.<p>I'd rather play a level with high r_speeds that is good fun, than one with low r_speeds that's boring, a combination of both makes an excellent level.<p>The bottom line for all budding map designers out there is to read every little tip you can get your hands on - what was relevant to Quake is still relevant to Half Life editing - read design guides, read interviews with top level designers, and above all download levels and form your own opinion.<p>Q3Arena is just around the corner - the minimum specs are a 200mmx, 32meg and a 3D card - there are no plans right now for including software rendering - specular lighting and curved surfaces are going to make the designers job harder, but because of the minumum specs of a 200mmx, 32meg and a 3D card, we can afford to have higher poly counts in levels - how high remains to be seen.<p>For those who don't make the grade on the hardware side, I guess it's time to upgrade - beg, borrow, steal, your gonna be left out otherwise...</div></td></tr>

<HR>This is entirely off topic, but I have heard a few rumours about Q3A and architectural limits.  In Quake and Quake 2, everything was measured in faces.  You could have about 650 faces visable.  This is now changing for Q3A, everything is triangles.  If you have Q2 and GL gl_showtris will show how an average face is usually broken into 2 triangles.   Now the magic number, 10,000 triangles.  Such a huge increase from 650 faces?  Somewhat!  The rspeed polygon count would be somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000.  Maybe even more if you have lots of simple faces!  However Ill take advantage of those new curves surfaces.  Finally a chance to build some real architecture  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif">  <p><P>------------------<BR>Brian "Somberfire" Smedley<br>ACD Systems LTD,<br>Head of Game Utility Design</div></td></tr>

<HR>Is it just me or has this whole debate broken into nothing but a wordy flame war?! People started this debate with valid points, and the points are still valid, but they're being delivered in a series of insults.<br>Let's settle down people, I think we all want to help the mapping/playing community, and WE are one community. This fact should be apparent in the unprofessionalism of user maps that caused this whole debate: The players ARE the mappers. If there were dedicated professional map makers making all the maps out there, this topic never would have started. Games are getting more interactive: You don't just play them now, you are given the tools to help CREATE them. To make them whatever you want. This is damn fine development in my eyes. I'm waiting for the day when everyone and their brother can make a complete mod at the drop of hat!<br>The lack of professional maps isn't a bad thing! These are people at home who can now add on to their favorite games and say, "Wow! Look at this cool thing I created!!!" Do I want to play on it? Maybe not, but if it makes that person enjoy the game and experience more, than it's a GOOD thing. I would love it if everyone could produce perfect maps! But as it stands, they can't. I still hope everyone who wants to make a map, no matter how much I dislike it, makes their map, and I hope they UL it, and I hope it makes them damn happy! If someone's running a server with a map that I hate, I don't go to that server. There are plenty of servers, and the great majority of them (so far as I've seen) use ONLY Valve's maps. There are probably THOUSANDS of user-made Q2 maps, some of which are on par with the professionals, but most Q2 servers I see use only id's maps. I guess my point is that user made maps, however crappy they might be you and me, don't HURT the game. They only help. There will always be servers that play valve's maps, and we can always stay on those servers if we want. <br>If you want to help raise the standard of professionalism in user-made maps, make professional maps... find someone who enjoys making maps but is not technically skilled and TELL THEM how make professional maps. Write some tutorials on lowering r_speeds, write ariticles. There are plenty of forums for them and this addition will only help game as well.<br>Lets not bicker people! Let's get constructive and HELP the community!</div></td></tr>

<HR>Hi,<br>   I think the idea of having a map maker in on a review site is a great idea and I would offer to help raduim except I'm going to be doing this very thing for Q-PoP. <br>   This topic is of great interest to me due to the fact that I am a map maker as well as someone who is about to delve into the wide world of map reviews. I have not finished any reviews as yet and I am still working out how to do this right. Heres the idea that we have come up with that might have saved radium a few flames (although I may get some as well).<br>We will review maps and maps in progress as well as the source files for the map. Thats it, a review of how things look, and play as well as how the map was made. I'm going to be reviewing the .maps to see the technique of the mapper. I will test in as many modes and conditions as I can to get a feeling for how the map really works. The difference between what I do and what radium does is that this will be done in order to help mappers make better more playable maps. This should indirectly help radium to see better maps come his way.<br>   I hear a few of you laughing..."No one will give this guy thier source maps." But I already have some (Quake2) and I will get more (Half-Life etc.) in order to help educate map makers on how to make better levels. <br>   The only hinderence to my proces may be that I specialize in Qoole and will be reviewing Qoole made maps.  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"> <br>   Good luck making everyone happy radium. <br>   <P>------------------<BR>raYGunn<br>qoole.gamedesign.net</div></td></tr>

<HR>Oh my this is an intresting thread  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>I may not be all here (it's been a long fun night) but im gonna attempt to add some of that awesome weasl wisdom. Ok maybe it's not wise, but im sure as hell entitled to my opinion (and my bad grammer and spelling)<p>First off everyone needs to take a couple of deep breaths, and get some of that baby batter of the brain. Now that that's done lets disscuss this like civalized people. Everyone is bringing up good points, a bit long winded at times, so lets try to analyze this load of shit that's been thrown our way. Ok?<p>Radium: Learn to take critism. Quite being so defensive. If you ever want to become a truly great level review site you need to learn to dodge the bullshit, and listen to the valid complaints. Yes at times i feel your reviews are slightly biased. You need to find yourself a mold and stick to that. People should be able to perdict what type of score a map will get "before hand" not on your whim at that time. Consistancy is the key. Oh and if in case you wonder why im rambling about level review like i know what the fuck i'm talking about.. Well i learned a bit from crash ok? He's a legend he had it down smack. Consitancy, and a review that was tailored to mapper. He pointed out problems, and provided mappers with a useful grade of their level.<p>Dante: Yeah people slaming your work sucks, but his points are valid. Learn from it instead of attacking the messanger. <p>Tigger-oN: Don't start public attacks, it just doesnt look good. If you have some problems with someones levels email the level author, dont post your complaints on the board and start a flame war. Your email was well written but at times boarded on opinion. It's NEVER good to attack people with your opinion. Always use facts.<p>Enough of my rant, time to refuel my addiction to Baldur's Gate  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><P>------------------<BR>------------------------<br>Luke "weasl" Whiteside<br>r u s t<br>Content/News Editor<br>Ward Six<br>Level Designer<br>-------------------------</div></td></tr>

<HR>Well, I'm not a HL map maker, but that has nothing to do with it.<p>I'll make this brief, but to the point.<p>10 years ago, no one had anything like Q2. Now there is also HL and Unreal.<p>Ove rthe history personal computers, sometimes the software technologyu was ahead of hardware technology. Sometimes it was just the reverse.<p>I say fuck the r_speeds, full speed ahead! If the mappers press the limits, the hardware AND software developers will do something to accomodate them. We are aon the verge of new techology, and WE MAPPERS are leading the way.<p>Sooner or later, the p166's are going to be dust, and most likely it will be sooner. If I were stuck with a P166, I'd upgrade. I recently did. Went form P133 to 300 Mhz, and I'll never look back.<p>You can't stand in the way of progress. It will not give way and meet your terms if you have last year's computer. So don't be a boat anchor. You can be the boat captain, and NOW is your opportunity.<p>==========<br>To SombreFire's statements -<p>"If your map has excessive r_speeds, it is a failure.<p>If your map will not run in Software, it is a failure.<p>If your map has visable errors, it is a failure."<p>This is pure bullshit, narrow minded thinking, and can be recited by any trained monkey. Level making is an art. Art lmpws no rules.<p>If you don't press the limits, you're not an artist. You're merely a monkey, trained to fit the mold. <p>NOBODY paints by the numbers anymore.<p><br><P>------------------<BR>SlowHandd<br>SlowHandd's Musical Expedition - Back to the Sixties.<br>http://www.gopherbroke.com/MidiExped/</div></td></tr>

<HR> A lot of interesting things have come up in the course of this discussion. I am an aspiring wannabe map-maker myself, and I have learned a thing or two from this. I have made some maps over the last 2 years, but have kept them to myself, as I don't find them good enough to bother anyone else with yet... I would like to express some opinions for anyone doing a map-reviewing site (radium or whoever):<p>There should be room for both subjective opinions and objective data in a review.<br>There are certain aspects that are really <br>easy to judge objectively (max r_speed,<br>obvious flaws, bad texture placement etc),<br>and everyone know how to relate to these,<br>whilst other aspects (playability, fun, gameflow etc) must be judged more subjectively. <p>It is a good thing if the site is of service to both the people playing the maps and the people making them. It shouldn't be too hard to combine these. The players learn what maps to download, and the mappers learn what can be improved in their maps. Everyone is happy...<p>Look at how q2pmp (http://www.planetquake.com/q2pmp/) <br>are doing their reviews, very informative, and with close examination of the different technical sides of the models reviewed. If a model has too many polygons, it isn't found worthy of inclusion in their packs (is a "failure" as someone else mentioned earlier here). This site pays close attention to the limitations of the game engine, and the models are primarily reviewed with that in mind.<p>One of the most difficult sides of map-making or modelling is the compromise between good looks and a low (enough) polygon-count. Players want both, and map-makers should be rewarded for creating maps with both.<br>I also believe players want both of these.<p>Finally I would like to express my respect to radium and everyone else who makes an effort to create websites with real content. <p> </div></td></tr>

<HR>I am an unknown in this community but I have been making maps since doom2. Now with Half-Life things have become more complicated and there are quite a few parameters to take into account when designing a playable map and it wont matter if it is a single player map or an internet dm map.<p>I enjoy creating maps but I'm having problems making them good enough to be realesed to the public. Oh, sure there are lots of tutorials spread out through the sites but almost everyone tells me how to create various entities, scripted functions and basically lots of good stuff on effects. <p>But I can't find anything teaching me how to design for low r_speeds or how to minimize polygons yet having a good architecture. Sure I can minimize detail and make my areas smaller but if I want to create something like 'bounce' I want to now how Valve can do those big outdoor areas and still get an r_speeds of max 700.<p>So, please, all you cunning mapmakers out there, create articles and tutorials to explain the concept of r_speed, polygons, clipbrushes and all those other fancy hl-buzzwords that we, beginners with good map-ideas, have no clue about. I for sure would like to know what a clipbrush is, what r_speeds is based on, how polygons are displayed, and so on...<p>If you could share som source code maps it would be great. We are all in this game together, we play together, we frag each other on the net and laugh about it so wy can't we share our constructive work with each other. Sure, your great tricks could be stolen but I'm sure people in this community still knows who made the orginal map or effect and we all now that ripping things right off is not what we mappers do. We learn from good ideas, tweaks them and eventually comes up with our own version.<p>And thus we'll all have a larger amount of great maps to choose from.<p>'Nuff said<br>/SpinDisc</div></td></tr>

<HR>I just wanted to point out to everyone that Dante_1 was made partly as something to release and get feedback from... and partly a test, I wanted to see how the Half_life engine would handle the gameplay that these kinds of environments generate.<br>I had to develop and release this map in a short time... I chose to leave in certain 'obvious' mistakes to get it out before I had to stop work for exams (which would have delayed it too long).<br>THIS WAS MY FIRST COMPLETE MAP. I'm not a seasoned pro like autolycus or tigger... this was my first try at a deathmatch map.<br>I thought out stuff that I didn't like about lots of current dm levels. Corridors and courtyards play roughly the same, no matter HOW you dress them up. I wanted to try a different kind of playing style... it killed r_speeds.<br>I think we a few revisions, gantry could've had respectable r_speeds (but those revisions would've taken too long).<br>I cannot justify things said in my review because I didn't say them, but I thank Radium for the review and hope that at least a few things were true. One thing's for sure, he enjoyed playing it. If you don't have the system, don't download it. Yeah, he may have given me an over-generous speed mark, but he stated that it slowed on a p300... surely that's enough to stop anyone below that downloading to actually play it ?<br>I have played quite a few fun matches on it and I have a p133, 32mb, v1, 33.6 connect.<p>Right, I think that's all...<P>------------------<BR>Dante </div></td></tr>

<HR>I've been mapping for a long time and I've seen system requirements slowly going up.<p>Half-Life has the required system of a P133, 24MB RAM, SVGA, high-color (16-bit), 2X CD-ROM drive, 400MB HD space, Win-compatible soundcard, a mouse, a keyboard, win95/98/NT.<p>Now, why do you think Valve put that on the box? Just for fun? Do you see 3d Card Required? Hell no! Those requirements are on the box because they are the machine that Valve built Half-Life to run on! Valve took the time to tweak their maps until they ran smoothly in every video mode the game supports and that's what mappers should be doing too!<p>Sure there are people that have dual pentium systems with an insane ammount of ram and 2 video cards, but the majority of gamers still have low end machines with no video card. I've got a P166 w/24 RAM and no 3d card, Half-Life runs great on it.<p>I'm forced to play and test my maps in software mode, so naturally I fix any problems that creep up with sky showing up when it's not supposed to or brushes popping in/out of existence. I don't care if the r_speeds are fine, you can still have brushes and sky doing that! It's something that the engine can't handle properly and if the engine can't handle it, it shouldn't be there in the first place.<p>Anyone can build a map, but it takes someone who is willing to put some time into it and do it right to build a MAP. Mapping is not easy and it's getting more and more complicated. A lot of mappers think that if they're poly counts are low in the .map file that the map is going to run great. Hello? Who told them that? Do you know what compiling a map does to it? The map gets chopped up into smaller chunks, sometimes too many for the engine to properly handle and you get those errors like brushes popping in/out of the map.<p>All of these things can be done away with very easily. Look at how detail some of the maps in Half-Life are, study them. Yes they are detailed, but that detail comes from good use of textures and great lighting. You'll probably also notice a lot of twists and turns too, those really help to keep the r_speeds down and block the engine from drawing things that it doesn't need to. This is what we had to do with Quake and you damn sure have to do it with Half-Life.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is not to build large open areas, you're asking for trouble if you do. You need to put things in the map that will block off some areas of that large area like a wall of rocks or a tall building in the middle of it. Look at how Valve did their outdoor areas, study them.<p>The Half-Life levels and the .map files for some of them that are in the mini sdk can prove quite useful. With the .map file you can actually see what Valve did to keep the map playable!<p>Something you should also check out, is in Rust's Quake2 Tutorials section, called Polygon Count Reduction Methods. Why do you think those guys put that tutorial together? They did it because they want to show people how to make a great map with a lot of detail and still keep it playable! I suggest that you go and read that tutorial right now, it's excellent.<p>I guess what I'm really trying to say is that if you're going to build a map, take the time to make sure it runs in all video modes. If you want to build a map to utilize your high end machine, go ahead and do it, but at least say in the text file you need a high end machine to run it. I really believe that maps that have high r_speeds should be be rated normally and then lose 30 or 40 points for not meeting the damn system requirements. It's really easy to build a map with an insane ammount of eye candy, it's hard to build a map with a little eye candy and still make it awesome.<p>Like one of the tip of the days on my own site say "Don't go overboard with detail! A little eye candy will go a long way."<p><br>Barracuda<p>3d Workshop<br><A HREF="http://www.feartech.com/editing/">http://www.feartech.com/editing</A><p>Lead Level Designer<br>FearTech Unlimited<br><A HREF="http://www.feartech.com">http://www.feartech.com</A></div></td></tr>

<HR>Some of these posts have shown alot of intelligence and reflected alot of different opinions.  Before this thread takes another bad turn and becomes a board deathmatch, I think Ive gotten enough out of this discussion to remedy my situation.  What I plan to do is:<p>1) Re-assess and re-score controversial reviews.  I will remove any opinionated statements that can be mis-leading or are misinformed on my part and be wary of the same type of statements in future reviews.  This will mainly affect dante_1 and pipes.  Let the record show I still enjoy these maps and still refuse to slam them, I just accept the fact that I overlooked their flaws.<p>2) Test questionable maps in software renderer using the developers mode.  I dont have time to nit-pickingly scour every map for every technical error.  To do so is anal.  However, I will check anything that would receive high marks (above 65-70?).<p>3) Continue to alert visitors to the r_speeds of maps just as I have been doing.  If you are angered by my Speed scoring method you can read an explanation <a href="http://www.contaminated.net/radium/criteria_speed.shtml">here</a>.  This has been here for quite some time and Im happy with how it works.<p>4) Implement areas to promote proper map making techniques, testing methods and tools.  Tigger has great ideas for these sections.<p>5) Provide a section on "Submitting Maps".  This will recommend simple steps that map makers should take before releasing their map for public consumption.  This will include checking r_speeds, software performance, etc.<p>6) Strive for the consistency weasl spoke of.  This was one of the most valuable comments posted so far to me.  I completely agree this is very important and something I must concentrate more on.<p>I think these are the most practical solutions I can provide without having some regular map makers dedicated as part of the staff.  Again, that position remains open to anyone who is capable of filling it.<p>To analyze my situation any further is pointless.  My site has been successful as is with very few complaints.  Due to the opinionated nature of my site, Im surprised there are not more of them.  Im not going to change the way I review, or shake the foundations of my site, but I will provide more fact and rely more on it especially where scoring is concerned.<p>Thanks to Tigger and autolycus for starting this thread.  I believe the input has been beneficial to everyone as a whole so far.<p><a href="http://www.planethalflife.com/radium">|- r a d i u m -|</a></div></td></tr>

<HR>Being one of the reviewers for Radium, I decided to pop on here and toss in my $.0178 (after taxes).  First off, I just have to make the disclaimer that whatever I say here is my opinion and doesn't necessarily reflect the views of Radium or any of the other staff.  Not that I'm intending to slam anyone, mind you.  Just thought I should make that slight caveat there.  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>Anyway, here are my own views on the subject.  First off, as to our responsability as reviewers.  It's always been my belief that since radium has multiple reviewers, and hence multiple systems that the maps are being tested on, it is up to the individual reviewer to describe, at least in brief, the type of system that they used to test the map.  And I believe that most people are pretty good at doing that.  At least this gives readers some idea of where we're coming from, and if they see a high score for a map but it was tested on a more powerful system, they should at least be aware that (as the saying goes) "individual results may vary."<p>Having said that, however, I do believe that it's a good idea for us to start playing maps on software mode at least once, so that we can at least comment on obvious flaws.  But I also believe that it shouldn't affect the score of reviews so much as the content of the review.  For instance, if a map has flaws in software mode but not under hardware, a comment to that effect would be appropriate, but not necessarily a big drop in scores.  The reason being is that the map is still a good map, it just suffers from problems inherent to the engine and the mapmaking software.  X-fire is a great map, and I love playing it, even on software mode.  Certainly I sometimes think "man, if only it didn't have these problems", but it doesn't lower my enjoyment of the map by much.<p>That leads me (sort of) to the responsability of the mapmakers.  We are seeing an increase in the quality of maps coming out for halflife, and that is a good thing.  But mapmakers still need to be aware that there are problems with WorldCraft 2.0 (namely missing areaportal), and that the HalfLife engine is designed more with hardware in mind than software, and so things that work great in hardware may not look as good in software.<p>The next group that needs to take some responsability are the players themselves.  People need to start realizing that the trend in gaming is to go to hardware rendering.  We all know there will come a day that most games will be hardware only (any that are graphics-intensive, anyway).  HalfLife is just one step along the way.  While the software renderer is a step above Quake2's, it's two steps below what it could be if it were the primary renderer.  I understand that Valve did a great job making its maps run on software as well as hardware, but the truth is, most of their maps aren't earth-shattering.  They're just decent maps (considering that they're professionally designed).  We talk about raising the bar on the level of map design, and while some of that can be accomplished by skills alone, is it really a bad thing that we use the ability of the hardware renderer as part of the means to increase the level of maps coming out?  I don't really think so.<p>The final area of responsability falls to Valve and the next version of WorldCraft.  Now, I don't know exactly how areaportal and such work.  I don't know if it would require a total redesign of the engine or not, but if not, I think it'd be a definate boon to mapmakers everywhere if there were speed-enhancing elements such as this added to future versions of WorldCraft.  <p>So, to sum up:<br>Reviewers - take a bit of time to run in software and at least note possible problems.  But realize the good stuff may be hard on lower end systems.<p>Mapmakers - if you want your level playable by all, keep in mind that big, open, high-poly areas are not conductive to that.  If you design a level for hardware only, be prepared to make some people unhappy.  But don't put off making the next great map just because it won't work well in software.<p>Players - I think that most people playing on the internet should know enough that if a map runs great on a PII 400 with a Voodoo II, it doesn't mean it'll run great on their 166 in software.  If you have a lower end system, take note of what a reviewer has to say about the kind of system he's using, and caveat emptor (let the downloader beware?)<p>Valve - Give the mapmapkers something better to work with the next time around.  WorldCraft 2 is great, but it could be much better if there were performance enhancements.<p>Well, I hope that makes sense.  If not, remember it's just my opinion.  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>Mayhem<br></div></td></tr>

<HR>Just a note to clarify some points made by Mayhem, above.<p>Worldcraft 2.0 / Pro has nothing to do with areaportals and hint brushes.  Areaportals are a function of the game engine, and, I believe, would require significant changes to be made to that engine to be supported in Half-Life (keeping in mind that Half-Life was initially built on the Quake engine, with Quake2 code introduced late in the development process).<p>Mayhem also stated that Half-Life was designed with hardware mode in mind.  Far from it, a large amount of time was spent making Half-Life look just as good in software as hardware.  The only exception to this is the wavy water effect, which is absent in software mode.<P>------------------<BR>Chris 'autolycus' Bokitch<br>Half-Life ERC<br>halflife.gamedesign.net</div></td></tr>

<HR>Ok...<p>Jeez. I said this once to Tigger, some people see something they don't like and they just don't stop complaining till something is done about it.<br>Well, are you happy now? Radium is gonna change my review to something *more appropriate*. This is right, but nothing will take away the feeling that I got when I was told that I'd had a great review on radium, and how I know that I never deserved it.<br>Maybe it's my fault for releasing a shakey gameplay test as a first map. Maybe it's not. I don't know anymore.<p>Perhaps one good thing has come out of this, and that is that I have now made it a priority to make one hell of a kick-ass deathmatch map that has everything. Then I will come back and personally stick my tongue out at all of you  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>One thing you guys said was that it wasn't a personal attack. At least 2 people apart from tigger have come on and attacked my map.<p>And finally, I DO NOT like the way that guys come on and say that 'it takes real patience and skill to map, anyone can make a deathmatch map, but it takes a lot of work to make a good map that...'<br>Please do not tell me that I didn't spend time and effort on gantry. The entity work on that map is more complex than anything out there apart from Valve's work, and no one can challenge that (try me).<p>I will now retreat into my hole and lick my wounds. <p><P>------------------<BR>Dante </div></td></tr>

<HR>I commend Radium for his responsiveness to the concerns from map-makers in this matter, especially considering some of the less than tactful replies that he has been given on this subject. For this, he has my utmost respect. I was concerned that this discussion was going to continue to decline into a nasty flame war, but I'm glad there can be a positive result and that closure can be had.<p>As a map-maker myself, I was watching this thread with much interest, and was preparing to add my $.02 to the fray. I have been working on my first map intended for wide public release, and I must admit I shared some of the thoughts of Tigger, and was a little concerned about the review my map might get based on the criteria shown in the past. I'm am a strong proponent for low r_speeds and decreased lag in general, and continue to work hard to optimize my map. Naturally, with this kind of optimization, I am forced to eliminate or minimize certain architectural details. I'm comfortable with that. I think that's the correct way it should be done, and I don't feel compromised as an artist, as long as the changes doesn't sacrifice the original vision I had with the level. In level design, there is an inherent conflict between speed and beauty -- but I think a balance can be reached. Such a balance should be transparent to the "layman" player, as well. That's where an experienced map maker works his magic, IMHO. This is not a blast on Dante or any of the other map-makers that have bravely put out their works onto the 'net. I applaud them for making the levels available for all to enjoy, and I people should not judge them too harshly.<p>Dante, you do have to separate your own identity from your map. Some people are tactless, it's true, but it's not really personal I think for the most part. You have to realize you have just been caught in a crossfire. I think you can understand some of the concerns some mappers have shared here. PLEASE make another map like you said you would. That's right, make them eat their words. Take what positive comments you can out of this, and succeed brilliantly. <p>With that said... Radium, you have an great site. I have been very impressed that a site that is so polished has been created so quickly for a game that has been out such a short amount of time. I think the rating system you've created was already pretty good, and with these new standards you've outlined, it should become really excellent. I don't think you may realize what an impact your site has had on the HL community. I think EVERYONE goes to your site to get their maps. I think that why some mappers are so sensitive to the review criteria. If you wonder why competitive sites haven't sprung up, and that servers seem to be running maps that you recommend, I think this is mainly attributed to the high quality of the site. For the most part, it seems people think that the need has been filled for a map repository and review site. I tend to agree with them. Congrats!<p>BTW, the summation from Mayhem was great, too, though the area_portal thing needs to be discussed some more. That's not really a WC problem, but I digress...<p>Smarmy<p>PS. It's looks like you may be covered as far as support from level designers for your site, but if not, I would be happy to add what input or suggestions I can.</div></td></tr>

<HR>OK, I wasn't going to get into this thread, but SlowHandd pushed me over the edge.<p>I simply cannot believe what you posted above.  "Fuck the r_speeds"?  That's ridiculous and the mark of an inexperienced mapper/player.<p>r_speeds are what makes the map playable.  Period.  There is no discussion here folks.  A map with 1200 r_speeds is wrong and should never have been released.<p>I have countless levels sitting on my hard drive for various engines, which will never see the light of day.  Why?  I don't want people associating my name with an inferior map that runs slowly/poorly.  I just have too much pride in what I do to allow that to happen...<p>SlowHandd, to say that level designers are artists and shouldn't have to conform to rules is great and everything ... but most mappers are looking to get jobs with companies.  The last thing a company wants is a mapper who says "fuck the r_speeds".  That's like a texture artist who says "fuck color composition".<p>From a purist point of view, I suppose, yes, it would be nice to design maps with no eye towards running speed.  Hell, on Wheel of Time, I'm constantly having struggles with nodes and poly counts in areas that are visually wonderful, but I KNOW will run badly on the average users machine unless I do something about it.<p>This is not being a rule following monkey ... this is being a professional mapper.</div></td></tr>

<HR>Well well well!<p>Are we hot on our ego's today!.  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>1) A person playing a 3D game like half-life or any other high-end 3Dengine based game without a proper 3D card is a moron and shouldn't be part in this discussion. <br>2) Software rendering is slow as hell on a low-end PC. Despite the hard work of John Carmack for the software rendering engine, but it's not fast, but slow on a low end machine. It's fast on a high-end machine, but then the high-end machine is most of the time suited with a 3D card.<br>3) If people want to create maps, let them. it's their creativity and they have planned the map like that. If it's not playable on certain machines, well, perhaps those mappers have the same opinion as me. Bashing along people who are creative is so incredible low, it's so cheap. <br>4) A LOT of people bragging here about r_speeds don't even know how the quake engine works, how it renders the polygons, why it can't do large areas etc. STOP! get knowledge first and then start bragging. <br>5) r_speeds was a topic of discussion at the planethalflife board. what number is important? and why? wpoly? epoly? fps perhaps? there isn't any tuningtable available. Why not having a page where a samplemap is present where you can tune certain spots for r_speed values. You can then check them in the table how other systems did perform on the same spot. THEN you can tune your maps, NOT in any other way. NOT by not allowing the wpoly not above 700... NOT by not allowing more than 3000 epoly on a part where not more than 400 wpoly are. Why? because it's different for every person and every map. if a map NEEDS certain architecture, it has to be present. if it looks like sh*t, the map will not be played because no-one likes it.<p>And be nice to people. I started halflife editing a month ago and what I found in this community is that it's full of ego's that are so afraid anyone will hurt them. I'm now creating a tutorial of all the scripted secuences available. I've offered it to several sites. not 1 replied. weird? I don't think so, according to the ego's around. I think that's a bigger problem than the r_speed values in certain maps.<p>O and dante_1: I never play DM levels, but your idea and construction was very good. <p><P>------------------<BR>-----<br>Frans 'Otis' Bouma, <br>Senior Software Engineer at Solutions Design:<br>http://www.sd.nl</div></td></tr>

<HR>O and I forgot:<p>If a reviewer-site is gonna change the review outcome it's gonna be dumped by me as a site that will have my SP saga. Are you gonna change the reviews of all the high rated maps too over, lets say, a year? gimme a break!<p>I thought the guys at radium were not just a bunch of gamers that thought, well let's put up a reviewsite like there are a lot on the net. I think I was wrong.<p>I'm not a prof. mapper. If my opinion is now lower rated than opinions of 'prof.' mappers like some in this thread try to call themselves, so be it. I think though I outperform most of those professional mappers in 3D knowledge.

<HR>"architecture is a race between heaven and plumbing" -architect rem koolhaus from his book, 'Delerious New York'<p>thought everyone would like that quote on the form vs. function issue  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>a few thoughts on this thread:<br>-------------------------------------<br>a quick poll: how many people here passed 7th grade english? (people who speak english as a second language don't have to answer)<br>-------------------------------------<br>i understand the arguement about designing levels that work with minimum software & hardware requirements, but take issue with the notion that this is one of the litmus tests used to determine whether a level is good or not. for a professional mapper who is being paid for his or her work, and advertising that it WILL work with those requirements, of course it is. to not do so is consumer fraud.<p>an ameteur mapper, on the other hand, is free to design for a beefier system if he or she wants to, and is willing to accept a smaller potential audience. i'm not saying "fuck the r-speeds", nor am i pushing "bad design", or saying "bad design" is a good or even acceptable thing. choosing to create maps aimed for users with nice hardware doesn't eliminate the problems of working within engine and hardware constraints, it just changes them a bit.<br>------------------------------------------<br>and why not??? i'm working on several maps for Quake2 CTF, and really can't see why i'd design for a P133 w/ software rendering.<p>first, good hardware has become cheaper and more ubiqitous since Quake2 was introduced. and second, the vast majority of experienced, hardcore players have good systems. go on one of the more competetive CTF servers and you'll find a lot of people with Pentium2's or overclocked celerons, digital net connections, and voodoo2 or TNT video.<p>i have no problem designing for that crowd, as opposed to designing for illiterate newbies who come on a CTF server and say, "please tell how to i use hook thingie?" and then grapple to the ceiling and continually shoot rockets at the flag.<p>and BTW, i'm designing for a P200 with hardware acceleration and analogue modem connection, hardly a high end system these days. i mention this to point out that designing for a system beyond the base system does NOT imply that one is designing for a P2-450 with Voodoo2 SLI, etc...<p>and last, i've scrapped or changed a lot of things for the sake of performance, read every article i've been able to find on performance & engine issues, and haven't released anything yet because i haven't yet achieved the form vs. function balance i'm looking for. there's an implication in many of these posts that designing beyond the base system requirements is synonymous with bad design, or an excuse for bad design. it certainly CAN be, but it doesn't HAVE to be.<br>--------------------------------<br>i'd agree that this type of info, if needed, should be passed on to players, both on review sites and with the .txt file.<br>--------------------------------<br>radium's site is very nice  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>note that for each .zip he's provided a link to its accompanying .txt file - anyone who had bothered, for example, to read dante's .txt file could have read that it was his first map and that the r-speeds are problematic.<p>also, radium's new poll showed that a P300 and Voodoo2 are pretty commonplace now<p>on a sour note, giving a map a really high rating and then later saying he wouldn't play it over the net seems a little sloppy to me. correct me if i'm mistaken, but i would guess most people intend to play the levels they DL over the net, not on a LAN.<br>--------------------------------------<br>sorry if anyone feels my Q2 ramblings are off topic but i think the issues are relevant to half-life editing as well. i'll be playing multiplayer halflife when there's some CTF action going on...  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>as for halflife editing, my computer crashes everytime i open the texture browser in worldcraft...  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/frown.gif"><br>--------------------------<br>tequila  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"></div></td></tr>

<HR>Well, there are a lot of people with views on this. This is most encouraging -- knowing that others think, and share their thoughts.<p>Yes, technical issues such as r_speeds, size of files (both the .map and the reources), and other things make for a good map. And yes, creativity is important if you want to capture your audience's attention and keep it. A balance between these two issues must be made.<p>But to say a map is no good because it has high r_speeds is really senseless.  Most people are gonna look for creativity, and to say that a tecnical issue makes a map bad is unjust.<p>In at least two of the posts here, I have seen the statement 'but I never released my map because it wasn't good enough'. This is not so... the real reason you didn't your maps is because you THINK they are no good. Who put that thought in your head? I'm sure there is something good about your map. And after working that hard on it, you're just wasting your time if you don't release it. Don't buy into anyone's ideas of what makes a good map. Decide for yourslef what makes your map good. <p>If you are aspiring to get a job as a mapper in the industry, then yes, you have rules to follow. The company is out to make money. They gotta calculate what machine to target to give them the maximum sales potential. You gotta follow their rules of craftmanship if you want to remain a mapper. You have specifications that must be adhered to.<p>But if you are a hobbiest, there are no rules. You can target any base machine you want. Even if its a Cray, and you're the only one that has this machine, you can do whatever you want. If you like your map, then its a success.<p>Which do you want? What do you really want to do? Follow all the rules and make maps for someone else so you can earn a living, or make maps that you wanna make in your own vision?<p>I'll choose map making as a hobbiest. Its fun, its exciting, and is only limited by my imagination.<p>But if I were a professional, I'd probably be thinking 'Oh! Super idea! But i can't get away with it because it breaks the _____ rule'. All the while I'm making my map, I would undoubtedly have subcounscious thoughts about technical issues that would limit my creativity. I might be so concerned with technical issues, that my map is totally boring, lacking any fresh ideas. <p>Most maps are boring. <p>People have stopped, or have never tried to create something new and exciting, in the belief that technical issues are so important that if the map doesn't meet the specs, then the map is no good. These people haven't tried to trigger 14 events off of one trigger. They haven't tried to make a cliff that overlooks a huge canyon.<p>What a shame.<p>I think its a disgrace that we try to impose rules on others. Its a disgrace to rate a map poorly 'because it doesn't meet some specification. <p>What makes a map good is creativity. People flocked to Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Why? Because these had creativity.<p>I can just imagine Steven Spielberg saying "okay, guys! We're offing the X-Wing fighters 'cause they don't meet the specifications that have been set by others."<p>I'll stay a hobbiest. I'll target my own machine. I'll make r_speeds as high as 1000 if thats what it takes to make that one room special.  If nobody ever plays my map, I don't care. If everybody plays my map, I don't care. But whatever I come up with, I will release it. But I refuse to send it to a review site. I don't need their approval, disaproval, on no-concern. <p>Somebody somewhere will download my map and appreciate it. I f just one does, and that person is me, then my map is success.<p>Yeah, its great to see so many thinkers in this thread. Thinking is good. Take the time to think more often, and think your own thoughts. Free yourself from the bindings of your environnemt. Be free, and be creative.<p></div></td></tr>

<HR>I'm new to this thread & the map making community, but I had to take the opportunity to voice my opinion.<p>First of all, I agree with several other posters in the opinion that Radium has become the de facto Map reviewer and he has a great site.  I applaud his willingness to take in the critism and come away with ideas to improve his site.  I hope he recognizes the power he now holds in the HL community(whether he wants it or not).  If you don't believe me check the downloads from  a map rated over 50 and one under 50.  His opinion carries ALOT of weight.<p>Secondly, my take on r_speeds...<br>I mainly play on a LAN, because I hate the lag over the net.  We have a PII233 w/voodoo2, a PII233 w/o, & a P166MMX, so we have a good cross of hardware.  Maps like Pipes & Gantry were quickly discarded because they were choppy.  While we play X-fire because it is too much fun.  The guys I play with notice flaws on alot of maps we play but that does not stop them from playing a map that is fun. But speed(or lack of) kills!!<p>Just my two cents...<p>Storm</div></td></tr>

<HR>SlowHandd, you have a very interesting perspective. I can appreciate where you are coming from -- creativity is very important in a map, if not vital. But I have to disagree with your assumption that high creativity and technical prowess are necessarily mutually exclusive, or even that different. Like you said, a balance can be reached, and I think that's what makes great maps, well, great. It's not IF you follow the rules -- it's HOW creatively you do so. How can you make a fun, interesting map and stay within the limitations of current hardware? You can be creative about that, too. Just check out any map by Levelord. He follows the "rules", but makes incredibly fresh maps. Unless your ultimate goal is to never make for anyone but yourself, you should learn to imitate the pros.<p>Let's take the movie analogy a step further. I agree that the movies you listed are highly creative. My contention, however, is that these movies were highly sucessful because they were creative, original, and were well produced. Some incredible, technical minds went into creating Star Wars , for example. People with years and years of film production and special effects experience. Trust me, they followed the "rules" of movie making. It's a classic hero story. The cinematography techniques were superb. Sound effects were used expertly. Excellent editing. The fact is, they took the rules, and followed them, but did it BRILLIANTLY and creatively, in a fresh new way. That's the key.<p>I feeling that making maps meant to be enjoyed by a reasonably large amount of people is a what we're talking about here. Is the goal to create a museum masterpiece, or to create a kick-ass game level that lots of people will like to play? I'm not saying we should be designing cubic maps for 486 speeds, but I think a wide target audience is best. I think a lot of mappers agree with me on that, so they consider speed essential. I would like my friend who has a p200 and a Voodoo1 to be able to play a map I created, and others like him out there in cyberspace. I would NEVER say a map with a high r_speeds is a total FAILURE. I think the fact that the map-maker made an effort at all makes it a instant success, but only for himself. IMO, I think such a map missed an opportunity to be as good as it could. That's where the reviews come in. They're not meant to discourage or belittle the mapper (at least they shouldn't be), but to give them feedback on how they can improve their creation. If you don't care if anyone plays your map, you shouldn't care if it gets a lower ranking because of excessive r_speeds. But I still think it SHOULD to get such a ranking. If someone else makes just as creative a map, and it has better speed, shouldn't that author be rewarded with a higher ranking?<p>I don't think of the guidelines as limitations. To me, they are not bonds to hold in creativity. They are a challenge that I will accept and overcome.<p>Sorry if I rambled on here...<p>Smarmy</div></td></tr>

<HR>I think tequilla has a good opinion. My posting about ego's is IMHO in the same area: user made maps are user made maps. No matter who's paying you for doing the same thing for another game. Assuming everyone that creates usermade maps is doing that because he/she wants a mapping job is so totally bull. I come from the graphicdemo scene on amiga and pc, and most of the gamecoders come from the same scene. But a lot of the top-people in that scene don't want to be a gamedeveloper. <p>I totally agree with the person who said he didn't want to design for a p133 w/software renderer. r_speeds are just a very weird method to tune your map a bit, BUT UNTILL THERE IS A TUNING TABLE WITH SYSTEMSPECS AND R_SPEEDS ON THAT SYSTEM OF A STANDARD MAP r_speeds values are pretty useless. If I stick with 500 wpoly max in my SP levels, it's very fast on my PII400 with a TNT and not playable on a p133. Am I wrong then? no. it's a 3D game and the person who plays it should use a 3D card. I'm limiting the level, because I have 'high' r_speeds, and thus it's not looking as I wanted, and it's clumbsy too on a P133 or p200, because that cpu is not able to run a decent framerate in software rendering...<p>see the problem? ok.<br>fortunately in Q3 there isnt a software renderer, at least not that I know of. <p>Otis,<br>PS1: English is my 2nd language  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><br>PS2: I'd appreciate it if people just reply in this forum, instead of starting a rant by email.

<HR>The topic of "Playable Maps" (the subject of this thread, in case anyone has forgotten) is an important one, and it's obviously one where people have strong opinions, otherwise this thread wouldn't be nearly so long (nor would many of the individual posts).  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/wink.gif"><p>I see 3 major views represented here:<br><UL><br><LI>Making maps within the limitation of the game engine</LI><br><LI>Making maps that are fun to play</LI><br><LI>Making maps that are showcases of architectural design</LI><br><LI>Making maps that are all 3 of the above</LI></UL><br>To which I add another:<br><UL><br><LI>Making maps that run like Valve's maps do</LI></UL><br>Why do I add this? For a very simple reason, one which perhaps Radium (who is a professed non-mapper) should appreciate: Someone who runs Half-Life on his machine would tend to expect a Half-Life map he downloads to run the same. What does this person know about r_speeds? Nothing. What does he know about engine limitations? Nothing. But he knows how HL runs, because he played the game. He sees a HL map available, and he has a <I>reasonable expectation</I> that this map will run in a similar fashion.<p>Putting a tiny link to the text file is no solution, this is similar to telling people to read the fine print. Most will read the review's "Bottom Line", and say, "fine rating, time to click 'download'".<p>It is the "Bottom Line" rating that is misleading. Look at the points I outlined above, those are the major points of this thread, and should be the major ratings points in the review summary.<br><OL><br><LI>If a map stays within the limits of the game engine, and employs entities properly without goofy things happening, it should get a good technical rating. This would include things like enemy/item placement, lighting, detail, and texturing. If polys disappear do to high r_speeds, the map should take a hit here. Sorry SlowHand, but "fuck the r_speeds" is rather absurd.</LI><br><LI>If a map is fun to play, there you go, a fun-to-play rating. This would include cahllenge, strategy, and also play balance. No one's map need have their ratings downgraded here, if their map is less-than-perfect in another area.</LI><br><LI>If a map looks like a dream, well you have a high level design rating. Here's where architecture, layout, theme, and ambience comes in. Even if it is unplayable and has technical flaws.</LI><br><LI>Finally, to cover the point I brought up, minimum system requirements can be defined. This should satisfy those who want to make maps not limited by software rendering, while clearing warning off those who can't run them properly. Respect for those who pay for connect time is maintained.</LI></OL><p>Running a poll to determine accurately which radio buttons are clicked, by those who vote, out of those who visit Radium's site over the next few days -- only tells us what radio buttons are clicked by those people over this limited time. It <I>does not</I> tell us what systems people are running. And it is not an alternative to honestly rating maps against the standard Valve established. Like it or not, they <I>did</I> establish a standard. Is that standard to be ignored because they're not idsoftware?<p>Scrap the poll, and revamp the ratings. Maps that are strong in certain areas will be rated as such, and if they have limitations in others so be it. Give people something they can judge for themselves, don't attempt to spoon-feed them 'overall' ratings.<p>Now Radium, this is not a flame so please don't take it as such. You may feel otherwise but I think I made some halfway decent suggestions here.<p>Mad Dog<br></div></td></tr>

<HR>Halfway decent?  No, once again, I think you've hit the nail right on the head.<p>Again, sorry to repeat you, a mapper can <b>only</b> be sure how fast a map is going to run on the systems they actually test under.  And, not surprisingly, that same hardware is going to be the "standard" for which that person designs.<p>However, I think the biggest point that gets often overlooked is that speed is not always at the detriment at detail/quality/creativity/whatever.  There are indeed techniques (although HL seems to remove some of the more popular techniques used in Q2) to have a fast playing map and still have an interesting one.<p>The problem, IMHO, is when design techniques are ignored, for whatever reason, when a little bit of extra effort would have made the map available to a larger audience.<p>Again, most people (at least it's my understanding anyway) want to have a map enjoyed by as many people as possible. (Otherwise, the question that comes to mind is "why make it public then?")<p>And if a map designer is going to choose the path of a higher level of design or architecture at the detriment of speed, then I do think that they have to be willing to understand that those on the low end aren't going to enjoy their level as much.<p>Anyway, Mad Dog has made the point much better than I have, so I'll stop rambling now...<p><P>------------------<BR>Richard Neff<br> <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/dmm2editor" TARGET=_blank>http://members.aol.com/dmm2editor</A> </div></td></tr>

<HR>I think it comes down to 1 thing: is the game playable on system X and on system Y.<p>The reviewer should play the map on 2 systems at least: a p200 with voodoo1 and a pII350 with TNT.<p>If a map is stated as a 'high end system map' it should run OK on the last system, if NOT, it's not well designed (bad techniques used). <p>You see: the engine limitations are relative to the machine you run the engine on.  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"> it can handle a certain amount of polygons a frame on machine X and more on machine Y. thus the limitations you should consider are not statable as 'these are the limits'.<p>mad dog has a good point about the average gamer that assumes a map should play fine because HL's maps do too. Therefor I say, 2 ratings: 1 for lowend systems, 1 for highend systems.<p>ok, one last thing: If people try to be purists and have the urge to tell and convince everyone in town about r_speeds the way THEY think about it, consider that dealing with limits is one thing, but if they limit you too much it will drive away your interest in mapmaking. And that's not what this community is waiting for. <p>Face it: there are 2 systemcamps now, not just 1.<p>O<P>------------------<BR><b>Frans 'Otis' Bouma</b><br>Senior Software Engineer at Solutions Design:<br> <A HREF="http://www.sd.nl" TARGET=_blank>http://www.sd.nl</A> <br>Otis' officially downloadpage for all his (xm)musicmods:<br> <A HREF="http://www.xs4all.nl/~perseus" TARGET=_blank>http://www.xs4all.nl/~perseus</A> </div></td></tr>

<HR>SlowHandd:<p>I'm just not even sure where to go from here...  :P  You seem to have some kind of opinion that professional mapping means mapping to a set-in-stone set of rules and having no freedom, whereas amateur mapping allows for complete freedom and doing whatever the hell you want.<p>The reality, at least for me, is dead center between those two extremes.  I've been on both sides of the fence, and in both cases it was/is the same : do quality maps, but at the same time keep them playable.<p>Some people have posted more messages to the tune of "forget r_speeds, if a map is creative it will be fun to play".  Not when it chugs down the 5FPS and you can't move playing it on the net.<p>This is obviously a highly opinonated issue and nobody is going to change their minds any time soon ... so, next topic please.   <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"></div></td></tr>

<HR>Well Im certainly not going to run out and buy two crappy machines to test maps on.   <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif">  Thats the most rediculous thing Ive heard yet!  Its also not feasible for me to only select reviewers that have these two machines... nor is it necessary.<p>I also see no point in scrapping my review system <i>at all</i>.  I think whoever it was above that suggested another rating system doesnt realize that his system is even more opinionated and unsubstantial than mine is.  Fun-to-Play?  Thats better described in a review than by a number.   <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif">  Im happy with my system, and my visitors are happy with my system.<p>I know some of you may be upset that my poll is showing that less than 10% of people use software rendering and machines below 300Mhz, but I think this information should be of some value.  Even if it isnt accurate, its still a general representation of what people are using.  <p>It shows that more people have the capabilities to run maps with r_speeds in the range 1000, and thats why they are willing to.  This is why people enjoy these maps, and this is why servers run these maps successfully!  Maps dont have to run like Valve's maps.  Valve's maps run like they do because they have to <i>sell</i> those maps and they must run according to specs on the box.  User-made levels do not <i>have</i> to run on a P166.  Its merely preferable and good mapping practice.<p>I think we overlook the value of firing up gamespy and taking a look at what people are playing.  Those power hungry maps are valuable to many many people, including myself.  I admire the creativity and play value of these maps regardless of how many times someone gets on this board and posts otherwise.<br></div></td></tr>

<HR>Radium: Why is it stupid to have 2 ratings of playability: 1 for a low end system and 1 for a high end system?<p>A tip: look at ltn Dan's SP map rating system at planetquake. It's userbased and reflects the players opinion too. After a while you get biased too. <p>Why? because DM lovers don't express the same feeling about SP levels. I never played DM levels because of the telephone rates here in Holland and the slow modemconnection. SP levels are more my league. <p>But it's just a hint  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"> <p>I'm glad a lot of people have high end systems and can run higher r_speeds, then the SP levels we can expect will probably have more detail, which is very important in SP levels. <p>O.<P>------------------<BR><b>Frans 'Otis' Bouma</b><br>Senior Software Engineer at Solutions Design:<br> <A HREF="http://www.sd.nl" TARGET=_blank>http://www.sd.nl</A> <br>Otis' officially downloadpage for all his (xm)musicmods:<br> <A HREF="http://www.xs4all.nl/~perseus" TARGET=_blank>http://www.xs4all.nl/~perseus</A> </div></td></tr>

<HR>I'm sorry about coming into this discussion late, but reading through these posts has angered me greatly, and I feel badly for those like Dante, whose levels were the target of shredding.<p>Personally, I have never really been a fan of FPS'ers.  I'm a Starcraft person, myself.  But, after playing HL and Starsiege: Tribes, I've given them a little more credit (although, games like Quake and Sin hold little to no interest for me).  Now, when I bought Halflife, I was amazed at the levels, both Single Player and Death Match, and when I found out you MAKE levels,  I was caught (yeah, yeah, if I had looked at the back of the box, even, I would have known this).<p>Now, I believe that if Half Life was shipped with Worldcraft, it was with the intention of allowing people to create levels, both of amateur quality, and of "pro-material."  I'm insulted by people coming on and saying that "if it has high r_speeds," or if it doesn't do this, etc., it is a failure, should be scrapped, never released, used to make screen shots for Windows background, whatever.  I don't claim to be a great level designer.  I don't claim to make "pro-material" levels.  But, with the few levels I have made (released ONLY to my friends for LAN play on campus), some of them may violate any or all these map-making 'rules.'  But, my friends and I have fun on them.  Stuff is disappearing in Software rendering mode?  All the people I play with have acceleration.  Do I therefore think that everyone does?  No.  But the crowd I'm playing with has that available to them.<p>Personally, I'm using a P2-450, 128 RAM, and a TNT.  4 out of the 6 people we play with have something similar.  The other two have really nice computers, also, so r_speeds tend not to be a problem, and with the on-campus connection, lag is virtually nonexistant.  So, when people build maps that are a ton of fun and run exceptionally well on higher end systems, our group tends to snag them up right away.<p>To us, Radium is as close to a level review bible as you can get.  We've used that for reference on nearly all the maps we've downloaded, and have been more than happy with what we've seen.  Keep up the good work.<p>I'm not saying, however, that because we're all running on higher level systems, that making maps for almost exclusive use on those systems is good practice.  However, not everyone is trying to be a professional.  When we look at a map, what we consider VERY UNprofessional, is inserting areas of self-glorification into a map (inserting your name on the wall, for example).  Does this detract from our enjoyment of the map?  No.  But, looking at the map with our (untrained) eye, we think it's very unprofessional.<p>When Dante replied to whoever said something about how anyone can make a deathmatch level, but it takes a good writer who has patience, or whatnot, I agree with Dante fully.  The fact that someone had the gall to basically say that if your map doesn't exhibit the qualities of Valve's maps (which, by the way, our group tends to dislike), then it should never have been released.  That was basically the comment that drove me over the edge.  I'm working on a map that is as close to a replica of my college's campus as I can manage.  I've already built one that is a replica of my dorm.  Both of these (especially the campus) have high r_speeds in one or two places, but due to the nature of the maps, it could not be helped.  I simply can't pull a building out because it's contributing to r_speeds.  Now, because the r_speeds spike, is this a bad map?  Did I put in a lot of work and patience into building these?  YES.  Mine didn't require me to just sit in my room and build.  I got out there and measured out distances.  So, are these maps a failure?  As far as some of you are concerned, I suppose they are.  But, as far as I am concerned, these are about as far from a failure as I can get.  I accomplished what I set out to do.  Success.<p>If I were to release a map for public distribution, I would probably try to make it playable on as many systems as I could.  That's just me.  But, I don't think someone should be crucified if they're map doesn't necessarily play well on a lower end system, ESPECIALLY if it's their first attempt at map making.  Giving them helpful hints personally to them is one thing.  Publicly using their map as a spectacle is another.  It seems kind of rude, personally.<p>I look forward to all the fans out there releasing new maps, both "pro-material" and ones that only play well on higher-end systems.  My machine can handle them, and if someone else has the desire to built that beautiful architecture heaven they want to, I'd love to play on your 'failure.'  Worldcraft isn't exclusively released to people who can prove they are expert map makers.  Maybe there's a reason for that, eh?<p>OgreBunny, proud supporter of Radium's "pro-material".</div></td></tr>

<HR>I wanted to jump into this discussion many times while reading all the posts.  Along the way, a lot of the points I wanted to were maade by others, so I will just try to echo a few of those points with some emphasis on what I think is important:<p>(**Warning** opinionated attitude follows...)<p><br>The low-end system, as defined by by the game maker, is not just a bunch of system specs. they pull out of their ass.  They conduct market research using *real* marketing tools and design towards reaching the biggest market possible.  I see no reason not to regard their "low-end" as *the* "low-end" when doing map reviews.<p>An objective review of a map's functions/features is a *service* to help others use their *own* criteria for selecting maps to download.  Speed ratings should use a scale where some threshold is the point where performance might be a problem for low-end systems and should be flagged as such. <p>I think there is room in an averaged numerical system for a numerical "Fun to play" category without distorting the overall score too much. Especially if there is a warning for low end systems if map fails to meet the threshold set for the low-end. <p>Radium: If you care about getting accross something more valuable than mere opinions, you really should consider adopting a rating system that conforms to strict guidelies - especially when rating things like flow and speed.  You have a good thing going, judging from the interest, and your willingness to recieve input is admirable. <p>My guess is you are fairly committed to your site, as is, and it will probably take some competition to get the type rating system it seems a lot of people here would like to see.<p>Phountinhed<p></div></td></tr>

<HR>there is no reason not to release a map - ever! but a map should never be reffered to as *professional* when there are flaws all over it. a map is a failure in the profession sense of the word when the game engine can not handle it on the base system - end of story<p>dante_1 and pipes are failures on the professional scale of things, yet they are good maps in the fact that someone sat down and made them, took time to learn about level construction etc.. and someone else enjoys playing them, but don't ever call them professional around me, cause they sure as hell ain't. they have way to many flaws to be called this. a proffession map should have no flaws on the technical side. <p>so means that a box room could be *professional*? <p>yep, but show me a profession that would release a box room :]<br><P>------------------<BR>Tigger-oN<br>_________________________<br>planethalflife.com/tigger<br>tigger@planethalflife.com</div></td></tr>

<HR>Trigger-on: <br>'professional' is a word I don't understand in a mapmaking community. The only professionals as halflife is concerned are working at Valve's. The rest isn't a professional half-life mapper. <p>Is it bad not to be a pro? no. Is it necessary to be a pro? no. <p>Further on: who are you to judge what's professional and what's not? are you telling me that YOU can judge over pro material and NON pro material? If you keep on nagging like this a lot of people are discouraged to make maps.<p>And tell me something, 'pro', why didn't you make a SP level yet? too hard to do huh!, but for you as a pro just a piece of cake on a sunday afternoon, right?<p>Shut up about who's pro and who's not. The downloaders will judge over the quality of the maps, the players will judge over the playabillity of a map, the gamers community will judge over the quality of a map, and the skills of it's creator. Not some people who think they are a pro but definitely ain't.<p>A professional doesn't judge someone other's work. <p>Nuff said<p>O.</div></td></tr>

<HR>HRmm..<p>Well, this post is definately getting a bit long..but a worthy discussion.<p>my personal view:  I like to use the "rules" not to limit creativity, but as <b>swarmy</b> said "rise above the challenge".  I think it is fun to try and make the most detail with minimal brush use and <i>smart</i> texture use.  Lots can be achieved that way.  But there is also nothing like creating an architectural peice that would run like crap in game but looks badass  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"> In fact someone had a gallery for a while where you would make your own "art" in a q2level and then send in a screenshot.  All of hte "art" consisted of unplayable, but beautiful architecture.<p>I have also noticed that the minimum req. for games are slowly going up.  So slowly we are getting more room to play with.  But not much.  Pentium 166's aren't out of the picture. yet.  I don't think we will see a game with a minimum req. of a p2 400 anytime soon.<p>That would have to be my 2.<br>Keep on mappin'<br>smeghead</div></td></tr>

<HR>Trigger-On: a few more (or at least 1) IMHO's in your statements would make me really happy indeed  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"> <p>You state TWICE (in both postings of you in this thread) that some maps are referred as 'pro' material and you state that THEY ARE NOT. well, well well! perhaps it's your 46% at Radium who gave you the food for a thought like that, but it's an opinion of you, not a statement that is just true. <p>Rephrasing your statements a bit would make a world of difference here, because mappers like Dante, who is slaughtered here for no reason at all, are slammed in the corner of 'wannabe-good-but-you-don't-come-even-close'-goodmappers. Nice attitude? don't think so.<p>For all the lamers (yes, lamers!) here who think they can just throw mud at people without any fact or a map that is made by themselves and is by far better, I say: stop bragging, and fire up the editor. Show the community you can do better. <b>Prove</b> your statements with your own skills. <p>If you are not able to outperform the 'lusers' you all refer to, perhaps your criticism isn't all that right and well stated with proved facts. <p>The reason why I said 'a professional doesn't judge someone elses work' is ment as: a professional is just giving positive critisism, if any, so next time, the faults and flaws that are always there, will be eliminated, but will never burn down anyone. <p>If someone does that, he/she is IMHO not a pro but a sh*thead with too many blind fans he/she refers to as judges. <p>Mapmaking is about creativity. If you don't want that, fine. Go ahead and go on you'all with throwing crap at people who actually RELEASE some maps. <p>ANd now it's time to close this thread, moderator  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/wink.gif"><P>------------------<BR><b>Frans 'Otis' Bouma</b><br>Senior Software Engineer at Solutions Design:<br> <A HREF="http://www.sd.nl" TARGET=_blank>http://www.sd.nl</A> <br>Otis' officially downloadpage for all his (xm)musicmods:<br> <A HREF="http://www.xs4all.nl/~perseus" TARGET=_blank>http://www.xs4all.nl/~perseus</A> </div></td></tr>

I was unaware that making maps for games was somehow something that is exempt from this.<p>If maps cannot be judged, then what is any site doing reviewing them? Maybe all there should be at a map reviewing site is a list of links to download them, without any description at all (lest anyone be accused of judging them).

<HR>Ha Ha Mad Dog! I'm gettin' the last word in!  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>A list of maps without reviews?  Silly person - that would <b>never</b> work! (Note to humor impaired - it's a joke - case in point, cdrom.com)<p>While I certainly think that some maps in this discussion weren't treated well during this discussion, I do again think you're right.<p>As unpopular as it is, a map reviewer does have to point out the rather picky details of a map.  And speed comes out as one of those details.  I'm sure some map designers aren't going to enjoy such things being pointed out, but again, that is the whole purpose of having a map reviewed.  One has to take the good with the bad.<p>This is especially hard when you've spent hours/days/months on a map (and truthfully, you get so sick of it you never want to see the map again) but again, if you <b>really</b> want it reviewed, well...  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>And I've been there - I've done up maps and had comments/reviews/etc. with both the good and bad pointed out. Typically, experienced mappers already know what's wrong with the map, even if they can't, or simply don't want to, fix the problems with the map.<p>But, to keep my ramblings from getting to long - IMHO, as it's been said by many a person before me: Be careful what you wish for - <b>it might come true!</b>  <p>However, I do agree with Otis a bit - if you're going to offer critisism, it should at the very least, be constructive in some way.<p><P>------------------<BR>Richard Neff<br> <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/dmm2editor" TARGET=_blank>http://members.aol.com/dmm2editor</A> </div></td></tr>

<HR>Wow, what a thread.  Let me take the plunge on this one (even though I'm a little late).<p>People who complain and hurl insults at reviewers should walk a mile in their shoes.  I am one, I should know.  It's really not that easy to rate maps like radium does, especially Deathmatch maps, where not only can the machine determine gameplay, the connection and server can (and soon, mods) as well.<p>I'd also caution reviewers and the general gaming community that gets these maps not to flame the author of a beatiful map because it doesn't run on their P133.  Map making is HARD too, I've tried that (nope, not successfully  <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><p>However, there are so many things to take into consideration when reviewing maps, how can you NOT be affected by your personal views and preferences?  It's not humanly possible to become a machine, devoid of feelings and tastes just for the sake of giving a fair shake to a map.  <p>Radium has his views, and I have mine, it's just that he's in a much more public forum and reaches many more people than I do.  If I botch a review, I get a few emails.  No matter WHAT radium does, people will disagree.  Read the "You Can't Please Everyone" article by Rowan Crawford on Loonygames this week...<p>Bottom line is, just look at the screenshots.  If they tickle your fancy, get the map.  If they don't, forget it.  Load the map offline.  If it runs like crap, forget it in online play.  If it runs great, cool.  No one is forcing anyone to get or play any of these maps.<p>So both parties should have respect for each other... both mappers to reviewers and reviewers to mappers, though it seems Radium here isn't really insulting the mappers.  (I could be wrong on this one, some one will no doubt whip out a cut-n-pasted quote)<p>Oh yeah, to all those who posted that "there is no other Half life map guy out there..."<p>WHAT AM I, DIRT?  COME ON!!!   <IMG SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/discussions/smile.gif"><br><P>------------------<BR>Visit the 3D Map Realm for the best user-created single player levels!  3dmr.gamedesign.net</div></td></tr>

<HR>I really don't think it is necessary to have run a review site in order to have an opinion about how they should be judged. <p>Radium can run his site however he likes.  Personally, I think he does a disservice to both the map makers and the users by adopting a criteria that is biased towards his own meaty system and doesn't take quality of design into account -- but that is just my opinion. <p>Obviously, no review is going to be completely objective, but it doesn't hurt to make the review as objective as possible, adding personal comments as an addendum to each review.   Rating the speed, for exmaple, seems to be a major point of contention here.. What harm is there in including an objective speed rating that would warm lower end system users about playability issues?<br></div></td></tr>

<HR>What a viscious flame.  A disservice?  Ouch.  Whats odd is you say I adopted a criteria that is biased to my own "meaty system"... but that makes no sense.  Ive only had this meaty system since after christmas.  Before that I used my same biased criteria and it worked just as fine than as it does now.  Most of your comments seem ignorant.<p>You keep saying I dont point out objective things like speed... yet I comment on speed in every review, often rating the highest r_speeds I encountered while playing!  Have you even been to my site?  If you have you certainly didnt get past the news page.  Heh.<p>Reviewing is not easy, like eXodus said, try it.  So far you people on this very board are the only ones to give me such grief.  Ive remedied the errors that TiggerOn initailly brought to my attention.  These are things I agreed with and I appreciate his taking the time to notify me, but now this is becoming nothing but childish flaming.<p>This is all going beyond the scope of what this thread was started for.  My reviewing methods are not on trial here, nor should they be.  I point out enough objective information mixed with lots of my own opinion to provide people with my feedback on it.  And thats how it is going to be.<p>Basically, I put many hours of <i>my</i> time into <i>my</i> site.  My hosts are happy, Im happy, and my visitors are happy.  If you are not happy, Im more than willing to listen to your constructive comments and enact on them as necessary.  But, if you cannot be constructive, then just dont visit!  You are not achieving anything by flaming me, and your un-happiness can be easily remedied by not using my site.<p>You should see the emails Ive gotten in response to this thread.  Everyone thinks it is utterly rediculous!<p>Before anyone else spouts off any more ignorant statements, how about staying focused and quit flaming me for nothing... yes <b>nothing</b>.  Ive ignored it for quite some time, but it really is getting quite old, and I dont feel Ive done anything to any of you to warrant it.<br></div></td></tr>

<HR>I can't believe someone would say that Radium  is doing a diservice to anyone. Radium has obviously spent a lot of time and effort to give all players a site where they can download maps. <p>Upkeeping of a site is a lot of work.<p>Doing extensive reviews and posting them with screenshots and a breakdown of criteria is a LOT of work.<p>Creating maps is also a LOT of work.<p>I don't know if Trigger-on felt insulted by the score he recieved compared to the other maps that came in higher but that is the price you pay for being in the public's eye.<p>What is a work of art to one person may not be to another. Radium is giving his personal opinion, and I think it allows all map makers <br>to look at what he doesn't like and judge for  themselves whether it is something that should be improved on or not.<p>There are some low scoring maps that I liked a lot and a couple of high scoring maps that I thought were okay at best. This is my personal opinion.<p>All I can say, is Thank you to all map makers  for putting in the hard work in creating maps, and thank you to Radium for creating a place where you can get them and learn about what makes a map poor.<p>The only other thing I would mention to Radium, is maybe you could do a couple of maps where you break down ratings a little further.<p>For example:<p>Unoriginal content: -20 off gameplay<br>Cross hatching of lines: -25 off layout, texturing<br>etc...<p>This doesn't have to be a fixed rating system, just a way  to show why, for example, that layout only got 50.<p>I know it would be a lot more work, but maybe  if you did a couple of maps like that, then the mappers could get a better feel for why they on got a 40.<p>That's it. I think a little respect for other peoples work will go a long way in ensuring that the community continues to produce quality work.<p>Navyfighter</div></td></tr>

<HR>OK, I'll come clean right now and admit that I haven't read all 70 posts in this thread (if you're reading this, you have way too much time on your hands...), but I know from playing some maps that errors and flaws do not necessarily make a bad map. They can make an already bad map WORSE, but in a genuinely good map, you don't notice them. I played an incredibly good SP level for Quake 2 called "The Widening Gyre". It rules. It is the best map I have EVER played for any game, EVER. OK? There are some fairly wide open areas where it can get a little choppy, framerate-wise, and there are several small, but nonetheless visible HOM effects. But you know what? Even though I make my own maps and have very high standards (I won't release a map until it's as near perfect as it's gonna get :-)) and I am very critical of others' maps, I thought, "shit, this map is so damn cool, I don't give a flying fuck if it slows down or has a coupla HOMs, it's a beautfully constructed and VERY well thought out level". And I play that level over and over and I still love it. I'm loath to delete it from my hard drive, it is a work of art. Another example, one or two of id's levels in Q2 contain noticeable errors. Do you see people complaining and saying id make crap maps? OK, so I started a little thread on the old Rust Q2 board commenting on some of these errors, but hey, id have been in the business for years and have released hit game after hit game, and their level design is excellent. Half-Life also shows one or two visible HOMs in places, and some other visual errors are apparent, but even the most critical mappers who will notice these errors aren't saying "this map is a failure" or "Valve can't make maps" because this is obviously NOT the case. These people make a living making some of the best levels EVER. If a HOM or two here and there, or a misaligned texture were sufficient to cause any map to be branded a failure, Quake 2, Half-Life, and probably even Doom, would never have been released when they were, or even at all, and the world would be a very different place...<p>And as for software mode, yes, I agree there are a lot of low end systems still knocking around, and unfortunately, mappers can't please everyone all of the time. Personally, if even one person praised my map, it would be worth the effort. If 1000 people said "one of the walls disappears in software mode" I'd say, "OK, but to get rid of that error I'd have had to leave out some really cool stuff that looks great in GL". I'd try to cater for people with software as well as people with 3D hardware, and you can check out your map in software just to make sure the lights look OK and stuff, but sooner or later, everyone upgrades, with prices falling the whole time, and one day everyone will be able to enjoy your map in GL mode :-)<p>As I said, I didn't read every damn post in this thread cause there's just too many, so if someone else has already made these points, I'm sorry.<p>Slayer</div></td></tr>

<HR>Just to push my point home...<p>Tigger, I read your post a bit further up about a map with flaws not being professional, and I'm going to have to disagree. Like I said, "The Widening Gyre" contains several HOMs and is slow in places, but the author is now working on level design for Prince of Persia 3D (OK, so it's not the next Quake 2, but he's getting paid for it, and we ain't). Secondly, as I also mentioned above, id's and Valve's maps contain visible errors, as do a number of the original levels in Unreal, mostly quite noticeable HOMs. Would you call these levels unprofessional? id are the masters of level design, few people can dispute this. Therefore, I see a flaw in the argument that a level containing errors or flaws is unprofessional.<p>No flame, just my opinion. Thanks for listening.<p>Slayer<p>BTW, shouldn't we start a new thread? This one takes forever to read :-)</div></td></tr>

I think it has a great design, it's well organized, way kewl, etc.. <p>When I referred to your "meaty system" I was going on remarks you made earlier about how you rate the maps according to how they play on your box, described as a high end system.<p>I don't remember when this thread degenerated into a discussion about you in particular, but I think how maps are rated affects how map makers will build maps in the future and that, at least, is relavent to the topic. <p>I didn't mean to imply that your efforts to review maps, in general, is a disservice to anyone -- but judging from your remarks about r_speeds and other technical mapping elements, I think there is a lot of room for increasing the informational value of your reviews.  In doing so, you would be providing more of a service, IMO, than only offering opinion. <p>No insult intended.  I think that time you take out of your life to provide this kind of site deserves recogonition and my hats off to you for doing it.  I thought you were soliciting opinions on the subject so I was only offering my .02$...<p>Frag On! <p>Phountinhed </div></td></tr>

<HR>I just wanted to folow up more generally with those of you who are clammering about the impossiblity of the "totally objective" review...<p>Of course its impossible to have a 100% objective review devoid of the reviewers impressions... I was not suggesting that Radium or anyone else should even try such a thing or that it would be preferable.<p>This discussion was legitmately sidetracked into thoughts on the review process because it relates to the topic.  Radium was mentioned by someone as an example and he appeared to defend his methods which opened the door to a discussion about those methods.. <p>It bothers me how thin skinned everyone is about these things... It has been said many times in this thread now that map makers have no right to whine about comments made regarding their maps and I agree.  You put your work out there in the public and you open yourself up to scrutinty.  The same applies to anyone who runs a web site -- especially one that *editorializes* the work of other people.   <p>Just some thoughts.<p>Phountinhed </div></td></tr>

<HR>Hello.<p>OK. I have been browsing through some editing sites and message boards and<br>I finally decided to write this. Please note that:<p>* I am NOT a professional level designer<br>* I have done a lot of Unreal levels and my work is highly respected.<br>* I spent a LOT of time writing this thing, I got tired.<br>* English is not my language. Don't blame me if my spelling sucks.<p>So first of all, I want to defend Radium, who is doing his best to maintain<br>his site and provides all Half-Life players with what they need the most<br>(IMHO) - user-made levels, both SP and DM. Radium takes a lot of responcibility<br>by maintaining his site. When people come to his site, they expect good reviews<br>and they get them (good reviews, not neccesary good levels). I was simply<br>shocked that when I first heard of Radium and visited the site I saw the number<br>130,000+ visitors on his work. Wow, that's a good job. My Unofficial Quake 3<br>Arena FAQ which is one of the most popular Q3A sites on the net finally reached<br>100,000 visitors after being online for about 6 months.<p>Now, to the r_speeds discussion. I don't understand sayings like "fuck the<br>r_speeds". If you "fuck" the r_speeds personally I, won't even DOWNLOAD your<br>level. Let alone playing it. If a level looks great, but plays slow as hell,<br>then I won't play it no matter how good visially the map is and however good<br>the gameplay is. Errm...the speed of the level should be counted as a part of<br>the gameplay IMO, since if the level is slow, it can't be fun. I haven't played a<br>lot of Half-Life user-created maps nether I have made any (I am going to though,<br>I just have to learn BSP which support both Heretic2 and HL now), but from my<br>Unreal experience I can tell that each engine has it's own limitations (I hope<br>everyone agrees with me on this one). Quake and Quake 2 were made especially for<br>indoor areas. Unreal can easily handle HUGE outdoor areas without choking, you<br>just have to know how to make them well. 70% of Hl code is absolutely new though,<br>only 30% of the code is Quake/Quake2 and even QuakeWorld mixed together. All of<br>the Quake engine games were made with highly-detailed indoor levels in mind. Even<br>though HL utilizes only a small part of the quake engine, it's still the same.<br>R-speeds of 750+ in the action areas are a NO-GO. It all comes with practice though,<br>'cause even though Unreal wasn't designed for "small" details, my Unreal levels<br>were all indoor and with a HUGE amount of detail. But STILL...they run FAST. VERY<br>FAST. You just have to learn the engine. I agree that my first Unreal SP level<br>sucked because of it's speed (anyone remembers The Skaarj Castle ?). But DAMN,<br>play "Research Facility" which has been the "level of the week" on Unreal Resources<br>for almost a month to see how I improved my mapping abilities since then.<p>"The Wyldening Gyre" - WOW. I finally found someone who has played this map too.<br>I can't really say that it was the best SP experience I have EVER had (since I have<br>played HL SP), but in case of Quake2, this IS the best Splevel ever made for this<br>game. I fully agree. I LOVED the room with the red key, red armor and the teleporter.<br>By the way, the author has actually released 2 Quake2 SP levels. His first one was<br>made before he got hired and it was a BOOM in the SP mapping community when that<br>map was released. If you want to play "What the End if For" and "The Wyldening Gyre"<br>I suggest you visit the author's homepage at http://www.riscchip.com There is a level<br>section and some news and personal ramblings.<p>I also don't agree with the guy who said something like: "I did 50 levels and haven't<br>released a single one to the public because IMO thy don't meet the standarts". That's<br>a REALLY BAD idea. I mean if your level sucks completely, there is NO point in<br>releasing it, but you cannot improve your mapping abilities withou getting any kind<br>of feedback. I have been doing my maps without having any testers first and I was<br>ALMOST ALWAYS releasing my maps, but 1 month ago I got a guy called Randar to beta-test<br>my levels on permanent basis and you won't believe how much does his input help me. He<br>is a kickass player and has a lot of SP and DM playing experience with Doom, Quake,<br>Quake 2 and every other game you can think of. He actually plays games alot more then<br>me and his opinion is VERY valuable for me. The most commong mistake is to get newbies<br>to test your levels.<p>And finally, NO PERSONAL ATTACKS !!! Attacking and being rude to people sucks. I am<br>getting sick of all this. I am getting sick of people coming to Scary's Q3 board and<br>yelling "Don't make Q3 like Q2!/ Don't make Q3 like Q1!" Or personal attacks at mappers<br>because some of their maps suck. Hell, I am beginning to think that "freedom of speech"<br>on the net becomes a bad thing. Be kind to people. And if you are a mapper - be patient too.<p>Have a nice day,<br>Dan Naoumov<p>P.S: Be nice to me, or I will write an article about you :=p<p>Unofficial Quake 3 Arena FAQ: http://www.telefragged.com/q3faq<br>Flashback Unreal TC: http://www.unrealnation.com/flashback<br>Personal Homepage: http://www.telefragged.com/q3faq/personal<p><br></div></td></tr>

<HR>Jago, I'm the guy who made "50" maps and only ever posted one.<br>I don't see this as a bad idea at all - The making of those maps taught me a lot about level design, and I emailed some of them to friends for comments.<br>The fact is, none of them were really "playable maps" - either the r_speeds were far too high (inexperience) or I decided that they just were not fun to play (lack of inspiration)<br>I constantly download the top reviewed maps to see how things are done, and until I create a map which comes close to, or reaches the standards of one of the top reviewed maps, then I won't release anything.<br>I know I can do it, it's just a matter of time - something I'm very short of, so I only get to do around 3 to 4 hours designing a week.<br>The only playable map I released was reviewed at captain dynabauls mpq2 - The Chase - it made it into the top 50 there, and over 250 people have downloaded it since the beggining of the year - man, you've no idea how good that makes me feel !<br>And the thing is, although the map was a "playable map" the r_speeds in some areas reach 900 !<br>I can't bring myself to release something that I'm not happy with myself, what happened to all those other 49 odd levels I made ? - trashed.</div></td></tr></table></center><br><br><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td><div class="text">
