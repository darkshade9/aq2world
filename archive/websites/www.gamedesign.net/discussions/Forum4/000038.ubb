Z||000000||Nikos||01-26-99||04:58 PM||ken@ineffable.com||Does gl_showtris work in SiN? I'm using<br>the default Open_gl drivers with a TNT<br>card and r_speeds works, but I can't<br>seem to get anything from gl_showtris.<br>
Z||000001||eutectic||01-26-99||06:09 PM||eutectic@ritualistic.com||Hmm... It is my understanding that it *should* work with a TNT card since it has a real opengl ICD. Unfortunately, I don't have a TNT card but Bushboy does. Maybe he could answer your question.<p>BB, are you reading this?... Check it out and get back to us if you can.

Z||000003||zied||01-28-99||02:49 AM||zied@2015.com||in sin you have r_drawflat, r_draworder and gl_lockpvs, gl_showtris works also but only on cards that support lines (not 3dfx)...
Z||000004||Nikos||01-29-99||08:07 PM||ken@ineffable.com||I STILL can't get any of these to work.  I'm using a Diamond V550.  I've tried the latest Diamond Drivers, the reference NVidia drivers, everything.  I've tried Riva OpenGL mode, default OpenGL mode.<p>Am I doing this right?<p>gl_showtris 1<br>r_drawflat 1<br>etc.<p>I've noticed that after doing this, if I<br>say<p>gl_showtris<p>it reports<p>"gl_showtris" is "0"<p>as if I haven't set it.  But<p>r_speeds 1<br>r_speeds<p>returns<p>r_speeds is "1"<p>and this of course works.  I've got this<br>level that I know is going to be problematic and I can really use all the information I can get to reduce the poly count.<p>I've even tried a VOODOO 2 (although apparently it should NOT work and it doesn't).<p>HELP! PLEASE!<p>"Desperately needing those edges to show"<br>Nikos<p>HELP PLEASE
Z||000005||bushboy||01-31-99||10:34 PM||bushboy@ritualistic.com||It's not essential to use gl_showtris, if you read the tutorial on low poly counts in the quake2 section of this site it'll help you out a lot.<br>gl_showtris is incredibly difficult to follow properly, and hint brushes are a "hit and miss" solution that can take hours to get right.<br>I can't get gl_showtris to work either - don't stress about it, rather try and cut down on the amount of wpolys by following methods discussed in that quake2 tutorial.
Z||000006||BraFish||02-06-99||12:46 AM||brafish@stomped.com||gl_showtris IS incredibly useful.  And hint brushes are NOT hit or miss.  They are very simple to use and understand.  <p>I too cannot get gl_showtris to work using my TNT.  I don't think they worked when I had a permedia2 based card either (although they did show the polys of entities).  <p>The best you can do is use r_drawflat, but it doesn't show you what you really need to know.. what's being drawn that can't be seen.<p>You could always "save as q2" and check it there, but I don't know how useful that might be.
