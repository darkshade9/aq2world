 <p>From the title of this tutorial you will probably assume that I'm just going to 
    tell you how get scientists to sit in a chair. Getting scientist bums on seats, 
    so to speak, is a common query among mappers new to Half-Life, and it is not as 
    simple as it may sound (there are a few pitfalls you should be aware of). Even 
    so, it is quite easy as a tutorial. What I will show you afterwards is a little 
    more complex and interesting: a rather cool setpiece in which a barney sits in 
    his swivelling chair, occasionally rotating fluidly in it. You may remember it 
    from the beginning of Half-Life (just after you finish the train ride).</p>

 <p>Throughout these tutorials you may notice me paying an obsessive amount of 
    attention to unit-precise placement of entities and brushes. This is necessary to
    avoid your scientists and barneys ending up stupidly embedded in the 
    furniture.</p>

 <p>1.) As promised, I will first just show you how to make scientists simply sit in 
    chairs, industriously typing away or something. First make yourself a nice chair.
    99% of the time this seems to be the 'Chair, black' prefab in the 'random 
    objects' prefab library of WorldCraft. This is all right for some themes, but 
    remember you can always make your own chair! If you want a scientists feet to 
    rest on the floor and his arse to be firmly planted on the seat, make the top of 
    the seat (ie: the surface that you would sit on) 18 units above the floor. The 
    'Chair, black' prefab is 22 units from bottom to top of seat, but its only worth
    shortening if you are really pedantic!</p>

 <p>2.) Now we will create the scientist who sits in the chair. There are two ways of
    doing this. One is to use the convenient <a href="javascript:entity('monster_sitting_scientist')">monster_sitting_scientist</a>. The other is 
    to use a <a href="javascript:entity('scripted_sequence')">scripted_sequence</a> and an ordinary <a href="javascript:entity('monster_scientist')">monster_scientist</a>. A 
    monster_sitting_scientist will cycle randomly through about 3 sitting animations 
    in which he types, looks thoughtful and is generally hard at work. This is
    probably what you will want most of the time. The scientist model has only one 
    other sitting animation, in which he is supposedly drinking coffee. If you wanted
    a scientist to play this animation you would use a scripted_sequence and 
    monster_scientist.</p>

 <p>When using the monster_sitting_scientist for the first time, the main cause of 
    frustration is that the origins of his sitting animations are screwed up. Besides
    this, they seem to sink through brush entities. This usually causes the sitting 
    scientist to end up half buried in the floor, even after many futile attempts to
    shift the chair a bit, move the scientist higher up etc.</p>

 <p>To stop this happening, we will use a small clip brush, taking care in its 
    placement and that of the scientist. First place the chair where you want it and 
    turn it into a <a href="javascript:entity('func_wall')">func_wall</a>. This is not always necessary but saves us time and 
    patience because the scientist will not get stuck on it where we don't want him 
    to. Create a monster_sitting_scientist and place him high enough above the chair
    to be clear of it. Now move him so that the edge of his bounding box is in line 
    with the edge of the seat (see screenshot).</p>

 <p>Now for the clip brush. Create a brush in the shape of a small cube or similar 
    (eg: 4x4x4) and cover it with the CLIP texture. This will make the brush 
    invisible in-game, but it will however block the monster_sitting_scientist so 
    that he rests on the clip brush. Make sure you leave the clip brush as a world 
    brush (ie: don't make it an entity). Move the clip brush so that its upper 
    surface is exactly 16 units above the upper surface of the seat. Any higher and 
    the scientist will float slightly above his seat, any lower and the scientist 
    will be more noticeably buried in the seat (he will already be slightly buried). 
    Check that the monster_sitting_scientist is facing the right direction, if not 
    adjust his Pitch Yaw Roll (angles) accordingly. Then you are done! The screenshot
    below shows more clearly what I have said:</p>

<center>
    <img src="rust/content/half-life/tutorials/chair/chair3_new.jpg">
</center>

 <p>3.) If you want a scientist to sit with one of the animations not shown in a 
    monster_sitting_scientist, you will need a monster_scientist in combination with
    a scripted_sequence. First create a monster_scientist and place him out of the 
    way, it does not matter where but the player should preferably not be able to see
    him when the map loads. Give him a Name (targetname) such as sitting_scientist 
    (it's late and I'm tired :) .</p>

 <p>Create a scripted_sequence and place it so that the edge of its bounding box is 
    in line with the edge of the seat (see screenshot). The animation 'coffee' does 
    not have its origin displaced like the other sitting animations. This makes 
    things somewhat simpler. Place the scripted_sequence so that the center of its 
    bounding box is exactly 20 units above the upper surface of the seat (see 
    screenshot).</p>
   
<center>
    <img src="rust/content/half-life/tutorials/chair/chair4_new.jpg">
</center>

 <p>Give the scripted_sequence the following keyvalues:
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Target Monster (m_iszEntity): this will be the Name (targetname) of the 
            target monster_scientist, in this case sitting_scientist
        <li>Idle Animation (m_iszIdle): this is the name of the animation to play, 
            probably 'coffee' (see note below)
        <li>Search Radius (m_flRadius): you should not place the target 
            monster_scientist too far from the scripted_sequence, so that it is 
            within, say 512 units. But if you have to place it further away then 
            increase this accordingly
        <li>Move to Position (f_MoveTo): set this to Instantaneous (4)
        <li>Pitch Yaw Roll (angles): set this to the direction you want the scientist
            to face when he is sitting down. In Worldcraft you can also set this with
            the 'compass'.
    </ul>
    </p>

 <p>Finally, tick the No Interruptions spawnflag. This will prevent the whole thing 
    being borked when an evil player sets a crowbar to the poor scientists head 
    ;)</p>

 <p>Note on the animations: As I have said, the only sitting animation of the 
    scientist model besides those used by the monster_sitting_scientist (and a couple
    of turning animations which would look stupid looped) is the one named 'coffee'. 
    But if you apply one of the monster_sitting_scientist animations (eg: 
    'sitscared', 'sitting2', 'sitting3') to the scripted_sequence, you will get a 
    different effect from just simply having used a monster_sitting_scientist. Unlike
    'coffee' these animations are not looped, so the animations will play once and 
    then get 'frozen' on the last frame. This looks slightly wierd close up to see a 
    scientist not even breathing, but these poses might add interest and variety, so 
    it might be worth it, from a distance anyway. Anything else I should mention? Oh 
    yeah, if you have added your own sitting animations to the scientist model, you 
    could have them play with the scripted sequence, but then you probably don't need
    telling anyway.</p>

 <p>4.) Well by now you should be an expert on adding sitting scientists to your map,
    so I will move on to barneys. The only sitting animation which the barney model 
    has is the one named 'sit1'. This is the one we will be using to create our 
    sitting, rotating barney.</p>

 <p>What we are going to create is a setpiece which utilises an animation that has 
    been precisely choreographed to fit into a particular area in the original game 
    (its near the beginning). You don't have to recreate this exact area when you 
    include the rotating barney in your map, but it will have to fit the animation. 
    So its probably not going to be vastly different after all.</p>

 <p>5.) First I will describe the animation in detail. Our barney will be rotating 90
    degrees anticlockwise and back again (from the direction you specify in a 
    scripted_sequence). During the part of his animation in which he is facing the 
    direction you specify, he is reading a book in front of him (well thats the idea,
    anyway). After rotating 90 degrees anticlockwise he does some typing on a 
    keyboard. Try to picture this in the area of your map in which you want the 
    setpiece to occur. You must decide on the direction in which you want the 
    setpiece to be orientated, (eg: does the barney move from facing North to facing 
    West and back again, or from facing South to facing East and back again). You can
    then get on with creating the surrounding brushwork to which the animation has 
    been choreographed.</p>

 <p>6.) Its time to create the chair. If you want the barneys feet to rest on the 
    floor as he sits, it should be 22 units between the top of the surface he will 
    sit on and the floor on which his feet will rest. The 'Chair, black' prefab, 
    seems to have been optimised for barneys in this respect, fitting this dimension 
    exactly. The chair is going to be a rotating entity (func_door_rotating) and for 
    this reason it is going to need an origin brush. This is a small brush which you 
    incorporate into the chair. It is covered completely with the ORIGIN texture, and
    is invisible in game. However, its position, (or rather the position of its 
    centre) will tell the game which part of the chair the axis of rotation should
    pass through. In our case this is the 'stem' of the chair, (see next 
    screenshot).</p>

 <p>You should build (or rotate) the chair so that, in your map editor it faces the 
    direction in which the barney will face after he has rotated 90 degrees 
    anticlockwise, (if you are confused, see the next screenshot and the diagram at 
    the very bottom of this tutorial).</p>

 <p>When you have finished creating the chair, select the part of the chair which you
    want to rotate, (for example, you may want to not select the base of the chair). 
    Make sure you include the origin brush in your selection. Then turn your 
    selection into a func_door_rotating.</p>

 <p>Now for the surrounding furniture in which he is working. If you were paying 
    attention to my description of the animation, you will know that some sort of 
    keyboard may be required which should be in front of the barney after he has 
    rotated 90 degrees anticlockwise (alternatively you could attach the keyboard to 
    the rotating chair). Give our barney ample legroom to rotate.</p>

<center>
   <img src="rust/content/half-life/tutorials/chair/chair5_new.jpg">
</center>

 <p>Give the func_door_rotating chair the following keyvalues:
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Name (targetname): this must be set to introchair. It is imperative. If 
            you name it anything else, the func_door_rotating chair will not rotate 
            with the barney. This is because it is the barneys animation that calls 
            introchair on the frames in which he begins to rotate. We are not going 
            to be calling the chair to rotate with other entities
        <li>Speed (speed): set the rotation speed to something like 65
        <li>Delay before close (wait): set this to -1, so that the chair will not 
            rotate unless called to
        <li>Distance (distance): this must be -90 if the chair rotation is to be 
            synchronised with that of the barney
    </ul>
    </p>

 <p>In addition to these keyvalues, tick the Passable and Toggle spawnflags. The 
    first of these spawnflags makes the chair non-solid. This is necessary to avoid 
    it getting stuck on things and messing up the synchronisation of its rotation 
    with that of the barney.</p>

 <p>7.) Create a monster_barney and place him in the vicinity of the chair. Again, 
    you probably don't want the player to be able to see him just after the map loads
    or the player might see the barney flash spookily for a second before he is 
    teleported to his scripted_sequence. Give the barney a Name (targetname) of 
    something like sitting_barney.</p>

 <p>8.) Create a scripted_sequence. I will deal with its positioning in a minute (it's
    weird, I can tell you). Give the scripted_sequence the following keyvalues:
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Target Monster (m_iszEntity): this will be the Name (targetname) of the 
            target monster_barney, in this case sitting_barney
        <li>Idle Animation (m_iszIdle): this is the name of the animation to play, 
            which is 'sit1'
        <li>Search Radius (m_flRadius): you should not place the target 
            monster_barney too far from the scripted_sequence, so that it is within, 
            say 512 units. But if you have to place it further away then increase 
            this accordingly
        <li>Move to Position (f_MoveTo): set this to Instantaneous (4)
        <li>Pitch Yaw Roll (angles): set this to the direction you want the barney to
            face (before he rotates 90 degrees anticlockwise). This direction should 
            be 90 degrees clockwise from the direction the chair is facing in your 
            map editor. In Worldcraft you can set this direction with the 'compass'.
    </ul>
    </p>

 <p>Also, tick the No Interruptions spawnflag.</p>

 <p>9.) Now its time to position the scripted_sequence. In this case a picture really
    is worth a thousand words, hence the diagram. This diagram should tell you 
    everything you need to know about the relative positioning of the 
    func_door_rotating (chair) and the scripted_sequence, apart from the vertical 
    separation of the two entities. This I will tell you now. The lower edge of the 
    scripted_sequence bounding box should be 14 units above the upper surface of the 
    seat.</p>

 <p>Once you have got that, you are sorted!</p>

 <p>If you browse through the animations of many of the models in the Half-Life pak 
    file (use a model viewer like 
    <a href="http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft/hlmv/index.html">Half-Life Model Viewer</a>), 
    you will notice many long 
    'choreographed' animations. The one we have just added is an example. Others 
    include dives through windows, rolls and other action-packed stunts. Some are
    part of coordinated sets of animations from different monsters (the zombie 
    dragging two victims is one cool example!) All require precise positioning and 
    careful construction of the 'set', but if done well give amazing results! </p>
