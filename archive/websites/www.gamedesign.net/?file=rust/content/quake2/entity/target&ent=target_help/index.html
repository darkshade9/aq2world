	<!-- Start description -->
	
	<p><a name="#target_actor"><b>target_actor</b></a> - Not implemented. The code is incomplete.
	
	<p><a name="#target_blaster"><b>target_blaster</b></a> - The <b>target_blaster</b> entity is simply blaster fire that can be triggered. What I mean by blaster fire is like when you shoot the your blaster(1st weapon) or your hyperblaster. I didn't really notice many times in the id levels where these were used. The only level I remember seeing this entity is the first secret level. Anyhow, it's very simple and there are numerous uses for it.<br><br>The <b>first</b> thing you need to do is create the gun or whatever that is going to shoot the blaster fire. You don't really need to make it if you don't want to if though.<br><br>Next thing you do is place the <b>target_blaster</b> entity where you want the blaster fire to originate from.<br><br> There are a few key value pairs and spawnflags that you can set to make the <b>target_blaster</b> act in different ways. The  key value pairs are <b>angle</b>, <b>damage</b>, and <b>speed</b>. <b>angle</b> determines the direction the target_blaster will fire. <b>damage</b> is of course the amount of damage the blast will take off when it hits another entity. <b>speed</b> is how fast the blaster fire will travel. <br><br>
	
	<p><a name="#target_changelevel"><b>target_changelevel</b></a> - The <b>target_crosslevel_*</b> entities are used to trigger unit-wide events. Press a button (or series of buttons) in one level of a unit, and a door opens in another. They aren't all that hard to use, if you're comfortable with triggers and targets, but before we get started, there are a few things you should know about the <strong>target_crosslevel_trigger</strong>, and <strong>target_crosslevel_target</strong> entities: <br><br>1.) The <strong>target_crosslevel_</strong> entities work by setting one or more of eight spawnflags, which are retained throughout a unit, which simply means <strong>you only get eight cross-level events per unit</strong>.   <br><br>2.) <strong>Make sure you have a unit exit at the end of the last level of the unit</strong>, as not resetting the spawnflags results in fewer available spawnflags for the next unit. A unit exit is just a target_changelevel with an asterisk (*) in front of the actual map$startpoint keyvalue. Here are a few examples: <blockquote> <br><br>To go to e1u2 of the id levels (skipping the cinematic,) you would have a target_changelevel with the key 'map', which would have the keyvalue '*bunk1$start' <br><br>To go to e1u2 (including the cinematic,) you would have a target_changelevel with the key 'map', which would have the keyvalue 'eou1_.cin+*bunk1$start'  <br><br>To go to e1u1 you would have 'map'='*base1' (because the start for base1 doesn't have a targetname)  </blockquote> <br><br>3.) The crosslevel spawnflags are read when Q2 initializes the map, which means <strong>any crosslevel triggers will not have any effect until a level change. </strong> <br><br>With all of that in mind, let's start.  <br><br>First off, let's create a room with an <strong>info_player_start</strong>. Decide where you want your exit to be. Make a brush with the 'trig' texture at the area you've chosen as the exit, and make it into a trigger. It doesn't matter if it's multiple or once, because we'll be using it to exit anyway. Make a <strong>target_changelevel</strong>, and give it a key of '<strong>map</strong>' with a keyvalue of '<strong>tcex2$from1</strong>'. In this case, the '<strong>tcex2</strong>' is the next example map we'll be making; '<strong>$</strong>' means we'll be going to a specific <strong>info_player_start</strong> in tcex2; and '<strong>from1</strong>' will be the targetname of that <strong>info_player_start</strong>. <br><br>Now create another <strong>info_player_start</strong>, and put it near, <strong>but not touching</strong>, the exit (preferably facing away from it, but that's up to you.) Give it a targetname of '<strong>from2</strong>'. This is where you'll spawn if you come back to this map. <br><br>The next thing you need to do is set something up to trigger your <strong>target_crosslevel_trigger</strong>. This can be a button, item pickup, or anything that can trigger another event. Give it a target (we'll use <strong>tc1</strong> for this example.) Now, create your <strong>target_crosslevel_trigger</strong>, and give it a matching targetname (again, <strong>tc1</strong>.) Set the flag for <strong>trigger1</strong> in the entity window for your editor. Now, when you trigger it, the <strong>trigger1</strong> spawnflag will be set for the next map. <br><br>Save the map as '<strong>tcex1.map</strong>' <br><br>Now we need another level to go to. Create a room similar to the last, but with two exits this time. Set the keys for one <strong>target_changelevel</strong> to '<strong>map</strong>'='<strong>tcex1$from2</strong>' and the other to '<strong>map</strong>'='*<strong>base1</strong>'. Place an <strong>info_player_start</strong> near the exit that goes back to <strong>tcex1</strong>, and give it a targetname of '<strong>from1</strong>'. <br><br>Now, create a <strong>target_crosslevel_target</strong> and set the <strong>trigger1</strong> flag. Give it a '<strong>target</strong>' of '<strong>boom</strong>', and a '<strong>delay</strong>' of '<strong>2</strong>'. Make a <a href="http://www.binarydreams.com/rust/tutorials/func_object_and_func_explosive/func_object_and_func_explosive.shtml" target="_top">func_explosive</a><font size="2" face="verdana">, and give it a '<strong>targetname</strong> 'of '<strong>boom</strong>'. <br><br>Compile and run the map. If everything worked properly (cross your fingers, it helps) then you should be able to trigger in the first level, and then go into the second level, wait a second, and *<strong>boom</strong>*. Just to make sure, try not to trigger the <strong>target_crosslevel_trigger</strong> before you go into the second map. <br><br>For further experimentation, you can set up more than one <strong>target_crosslevel_trigger</strong>, each with a different trigger flag checked (1, 2, 3...), and then set up one target_crosslevel_target with those flags checked. <strong>Only after you've triggered all events</strong> will the target be fired.<br><br>In the example maps, the first <strong>target_changelevel_trigger</strong> is a button, and the second, Carmack's head (I just <i>had</i> to throw it in.) When you come to the third level, a wall explodes, and you exit to the intro cinematic, followed by base1. I hope you find this helpful, as it helped me to make it. <br><br>-<A HREF="mailto:granny@deepwell.com">GrrandMaMa</A><br><br> You can download the <A HREF="ex_maps.zip">example</A> here.

	<p><a name="#target_laser"><b>target_laser</b></a> - This is another somewhat easy entity to use. i'm sure if you've played through quake2 then you've seen many examples of lasers and the cool effects that id used with the lasers. The cool effects like the moving spiraling lasers are a bit more difficult to implement but i'll try to show you how.<br><br> <br><br><center><img src="/tutorials/quake2/tutorials/target_laser/laserpic1.JPG" width=250 height=188 border=0 alt="pic of target_laser"></center> <br><br>First thing you need to do is decide where you want the laser and what you want to use it for. The laser can either be <b>triggered</b> or <b>start on</b>. If you want it to be turned on then you need to <b>give the target_laser a targetname</b> and make some kind of trigger to start the laser. If you want  the laser to start on the just <b>set the start_on spawnflag</b>. The laser can either shoot in a direction or shoot at a target. If you want the laser to shoot in a direction other then anything horizontal or up and down then your going to have to have it shoot at a target. This target must be an <b>info_notnull</b>.<br><br> <center><img src="/tutorials/quake2/tutorials/target_laser/6pic1.GIF" width=125 height=318 border=0 alt="pic1"></center> <br><br> There are 5 colors you can choose from: <b>red, green, blue, yellow, and orange</b>. Just set the spawnflag of the color you want. You can also have larger lasers by setting the <b>spawnflag big</b>. If you want the laser to take off more damage then set the key value pair <b>dmg <i>n</i></b> where <i>n</i> is the amount of damage the laser takes off. <br><br>Moving lasers work just like the example above except the <b>target_laser must be targeted to a func_train.</b> And of course the func_train must be connected to multiple path_corners so it will move. The laser will follow the func_train. <br><br> There are some very cool things you can use lasers for. You can use them for doors, for traps, etc. On the <a href="/tutorials/quake2/tutorials/target_laser/rust6.zip">example map</a> I have made examples of 4 kinds of uses of a target_laser. One as a door opened with a button, another using info_notnulls to create diagonal lasers, another with a func_timer to make a laser that blinks off and on, and one using a func_train to make a moving laser. If you have any other questions on a target_laser then please post them on the <a href="http://forums.gamedesign.net/forums">discussion</a> board.<br><br>
	
	<p><a name="#target_lightramp"><b>target_lightramp</b></a> - The <B>target_lightramp</B> entity is another easy entity to use. What it does is makes a light fade in or fade out. I actually don't really remember seeing this used in quake2 but it is such a sutle effect that I just probably didn't notice. <br><br> The <B>first</B> thing you need to do is do create the light that you want to fade in or fade out. Give it a <B>light</B> value. This light value will be the maximum the brightness of the light will be when it is all the way faded in. <br><br> The <B>second</B> thing you need to do is decide if you want the light to start dark and become bright or start bright and become dark. If you want to the light to start dark then you need to set the spawnflag <B>start_off</B> on the light entity. If you want the light to start light and become dark then you need to have the start_off spawnflag off. You must also <B>give the light a targetname</B>. Lets just give it a targetname of light. <B>targetname light</B>. <br><br> Next you need to make the actual <B>target_lightramp</B> entity. It doesn't matter where it goes because it will not be visible. The first thing you need to do to the target_lightramp is to <B>give it a target to the light</B>. target light. While your at do also <B>give the target_lightramp a targetname</B>. Lets give it a targetname of ramp. This is because the lightramp doesnt start on and must be triggered by another entity, but we will get to that in just a minute. There are two key value pairs that you can set for the target_lightramp. They are <B>speed</B> and <B>message</B>. <B>Speed</B> determines how many seconds it will take for the light to fade in or fade out. So if you have speed set to 20 then the light will gradually fade in  or fade out within 20 seconds. The message key value pair <B>must have 2 letters and only 2 letters</B>. These 2 letters determine the starting light level and the ending light level. The range of these letters is <B>a</B> to <B>z</B>. So if you want the light to fade in from dark to light then the message would be az. message az. if you want it to fade out from light to dark them the message would be za. message za. Just think of it as A getting brighter and brighter as it goes towards z, with z being the brightest. <br><br> There is also one spawnflag called <B>toggle</B> for the target_lightramp. If this is on and you have the target_lightramp triggered with a func_button or a trigger_multiple then if you trigger it again with the button or trigger_multiple it will turn on and turn off as many times as you trigger it. So in other words you can use it more then once.(turn the light on then turn it off) <br><br> The <B>last</B> thing you need to do is create the entity that will turn on the target_lightramp. This can be any kind of trigger you want. It all depends on the effect that you are looking for. You could use a <B>func_button</B> if you wanted it to be like a light switch that you could turn off and on. You could use a <B>trigger_once</B>, <B>trigger_multiple</B>, <B>trigger_always</B>, etc. You could even use a <B>func_timer</B> which would make the light fade in and fade out multiple times in row. So make the trigger entity that you wish to use and set the <B>target to the target_lightramp</B>. For this example it would be target=ramp. <br><br> That's all there is to a target_lightramp. Pretty cool little entity which can provide you with some very interesting effects. In the <a href="rust23.zip">example</a> map I included a target_lightramp that is triggered with a func_button. So the lightramp can be turned on or off. Any other questions please post them in the <a href="../../quake2/discussion/quake2discussion.shtml">discussion</a> board.<br><br>
	
	<p><a name="#target_secret"><b>target_secret</b></a> - See worldspawn
	
	<p><a name="#target_spawner"><b>target_spawner</b></a> - A <b>target_spawner</b> can be used for a number of things. What it actually does is makes an item of your choice appear at the location of the target_spawner. Any single item can be spawned. Even weapons and health. id didn't ever use the target_spawner for things like that though. They mainly used it to spawn gibs, insane people, and creatures. This entity is pretty simple once you figure out a few things. <br><br> There are <b>two</b> entities that must be used to get the target_spawner to work properly. There must be the actual <b>target_spawner</b> and <b>some kind of entity</b> that will actually trigger the target_spawner into working like a func_timer or a trigger_once. <br><br> Now for an example:<br> Lets make a trap that will drop soldiers into a pool of lava.<br><br> The <b>first</b> thing we need to make is the tube coming from the ceiling that will drop the soldiers into the lava and the actual pool of lava. Now we need to put a <b>target_spawner</b> inside of the tube coming from the ceiling. Now we need to specify what the target_spawner will spawn. This is the part that most people get stuck on. Instead of actually targeting a misc_insane entity <b>you must set the target of the target_spawner to the name of the entity that you want to spawn.</b> So therefore in this example we would set <b>target=misc_insane</b>. <br><br> Next you need to create a entity that will start the target_spawner. Lets <b>give the target_spawner a targetname of lavapool</b>. targetname=lavapool. Now let's use a <b>func_timer</b> to actually spawn the misc_insane. <b>Set the target of the func_timer to the target_spawner</b>. target=lavapool. Also be sure that you set the <b>turn_on</b> spawnflag for the func_timer. Unless you want to make it so you can turn it on with another trigger like a <b>func_button</b>. If you were to do this then you would just give the func_timer a targetname and target it with the func_button. <br><br> There are some key value pairs that you can set for a target_spawner to get some different effects. They are <b>speed</b> and <b>angle</b>. <b>Speed</b> is the speed that the item will come out of the target_spawner. <b>If speed is not set then the item will be dropped</b>. <b>Angle</b> is the direction that the item will be spawned and if speed is set then it is the direction the item will be thrown.<br><br> One of the most common uses of a target_spawner is to spawn gibs and those insane soliders. There are 3 types of gibs. <b>misc_gib_arm</b>, <b>misc_gib_leg</b>, and <b>misc_gib_head</b>. The names are pretty much self explanatory. Another entity that is commonly spawned on a few of the id levels is the <b>misc_insane</b> entity which is an insane solider.<br><br> There are many uses for a target_spawner. A trigger on one side of the level will spawn a creature on the other side of the level to surprise the player when he/she returns. You can even spawn health, weapons, and armor. Don't know what the use of that would be but I'm sure there are a few good ideas you guys can come up with.<br><br> As you can see target_spawner is a pretty simple entity to use. Just remember that you must have some sort of trigger to set off the target_spawner. Anything can be used...such as a trigger_once, func_timer, trigger_multiple, etc. It all depends on how you plan on using the target_spawner.<br><br> To understand the target_spawner more you can download the <a href="rust14.zip">example</a> map. Anymore questions then please post to the <a href="../../quake2/discussion/quake2discussion.shtml">discussion</a> board.<br><br>

	<p><a name="#target_speaker"><b>target_speaker</b></a> - The <b>target_speaker</b> entity is another one that will be used VERY often by a map designer and should be known very well. What it does is spawns all those crazy sounds you here in quake2. Like the humming of a generator, breaking of glass, water flowing, ships flying overhead, etc. I will attempt to show you how to use this entity...hopefully. <br><br>Creating the target_speaker - <br><br> A target_speaker should be placed where you want the sound to originate from. By default a target_speaker will not start on and will have to be triggered by another entity such as a trigger_once, trigger_multiple, func_button, or whatever you want the sound to be triggered by. If you want a window to set off the sound then you would create the func_explosive that would be the breaking window and add a target key and set it to the the target_speaker. There is a way to make the target_speaker to start on that I will explain in the spawnflags section. <br><br>Key Value Pairs - <br><br><b>Noise</b><br><br>Noise is the name and path of the actual sound that will be played. The trick to it, if you want to call it a trick, is that you must specify the directory path and the name of the sound. Here is a <b><a href="sounds.shtml">list</a></b> of all the sounds that you can use and their directory paths. A common thought is that you can only use the sounds in the world/ directory but this is simply not true. You can use <b>ANY</b> sound at <b>ANY</b> time. You will soon find out though that the sounds in the world directory will be used much more often. So for an example if we want the target_speaker to produce a pump sound then we would set noise=world/bigpump.wav.<br><br> <b>Things to remember:</b> <li>Every target_speaker <b>MUST</b> have a noise key.</li> <li>Case does not matter. xian.wav and XIAN.WAV will both work.</li> <br><br> <br> <b>attenuation</b> <br><br> attenuation is the distance the sound will travel before fading out. There are 4 different levels of attenuation: <li><b>-1</b> : No fade off, the whole level will hear the sound</li> <li><b>1</b> : Normal fighting sounds. This is also the default attenuation for normal sounds.</li> <li><b>2</b> : idle sound level. </li> <li><b>3</b> : ambient sound level. Default attenuation for target_speaker entities that have the spawnflag looped-on set.</li> a value of 0 for attenuation will default to 1. <br><br><b>volume</b><br><br>Volume is pretty self explanatory. Volume levels can be values of 0.0 to 1.0. 1.0 being the loudest. If volume is left blank then the default volume is set to 1. A volume of .1 will barely  be audible. If there are multiple target_speaker entities with the same sound playing at the same time then the volume will increase beyond normal but excessive target_speakers will do nothing beyond a certain point. <br><br>Spawnflags - <br><br><b>looped-on</b><br><br>When looped-on is set then the sound will start on when the level is started and stay on until triggered. Thus the sound will loop over and over again until triggered and turned off. Sounds that are looped-on <b>always</b> have an attenuation of 3 and a volume of 1 and can <b>not</b> be changed. <br><br><br><b>looped-off</b><br><br>Looped-off is the opposite of looped-on naturally. The sound will start off and then when trigger will start and stay on. As with a looped_on sound they always will have an attenuation of 3 and a volume of 1 and can <b>not</b> be changed. <br><br><b>reliable</b><br><br>reliable is used when you have a very important sound that player must hear, like for crucial voiceovers. It makes the sound that is marked as reliable to override all the other sounds that are playing at the same time. <br><br>Uses of the Target_Speaker - There are virtually unlimited uses of the target_speaker entity. Of course you are going to want to use a lot of the world/ sounds with breaking glass, moving trains, computers humming, etc. But there are also uses of the non world/ sounds. Like some of the monster sounds at random areas to create a freaky feel of the level. There is an example of this on the <a href="sound.zip">example</a> map.<br><br> Well anyways if you still don't understand please post your questions to the <a href="../../quake2/discussion/quake2discussion.shtml">discussion</a> board.<br><br>
	
	<p><a name="#target_splash"><b>target_splash</b></a> - first thing you need to do is open your favorite editor and make a small room with nothing in it. Decide where you want the splash of particles and create a <B>trigger_splash</B> entity. <br><br> Now you need to give the <B>trigger_splash</B> a targetname. For this example lets give the entity a <B>target_name of splash1</B><br><br>Now we must specify what kind of spark you want. There are 6 different kinds. 1) sparks<br>2) blue water<br>3) brown water<br>4) slime<br>5) lava<br>6) blood<br><br>To set this use the keyname sounds and set it to whichever you want from above. For this example we are going to set <B>sounds=4</B> for slime. <br><br> The next step is to set the number of sparks you want. For this example we are going to make it 2. so set <B>count=2</B> for the trigger_splash entity. <br><br> We arent done yet though. To get the sparks to actually appear and work right you must create a <B>func_timer</B>. This is what actually spawns the sparks. It doesnt matter where you make this entity so just make it anywhere on the level and <B>set the target of this func_timer to the trigger_splash</B>. So in this example we would set <B>target=splash1</B>. If you want the sparks to start on then be sure to set the spawnflag <B>start_on</B>. Below is my some shots from my example using multiple trigger_splashes to make the acid look like it is bubbling, etc. first 2 shots are from the editor(bsp), last one is from the game. You can download the map file <A HREF="/tutorials/quake2/tutorials/target_splash/rust1.zip">here</A>. <BR><BR> <CENTER><IMG SRC="/tutorials/quake2/tutorials/target_splash/1.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=218 BORDER=0 alt="image 1"><br><br><IMG SRC="/tutorials/quake2/tutorials/target_splash/2.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=177 BORDER=0 alt="image 2"><br><br><IMG SRC="/tutorials/quake2/tutorials/target_splash/pic1.JPG" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300 BORDER=0 alt="image 3"> </CENTER><br><br>
	
	<p><a name="#target_string"><b>target_string</b></a> - See func_clock
	
	<p><a name="#target_temp_entity"><b>target_temp_entity</b></a> - The <b>target_temp_entity</b> is one of the strangest entities available to level designers for quake2 but very very <b>cool</b>. In the game it was only used once in the level boss1. What it does is spawns some sort of sprite. You have <b>3</b> of them to choose from(that i know of). First is a green electrical type fire that gives off dynamic green light. Second is a pixel explosion that looks similar to fireworks. Third one is a badass cloud of particles that shoots up and then encaves on itself. My descriptions don't do them justice though, download the <a href="/tutorials/quake2/tutorials/target_temp_entity/rusttemp.zip">example</a> map and check them out for yourself. I'll show you how you can use these cool effects in your levels below. <br><br>Creating the target_temp_entity<br><br> - First you have to decide where you want the sprite to spawn at. Place the <b>target_temp_entity</b> at this location.<br><br>Since it is a target_ entity it must be triggered by something else. So therefore you must trigger it with an entity such as a <a href="../triggers_and_more/triggers_and_more.shtml">trigger_once, trigger_multiple, trigger_relay, trigger_always,</a> <a href="../func_button/func_button.shtml">func_button</a>, <a href="../light/light.shtml#func_timer">func_timer</a>, etc.<br><br> Key Value Pairs - <br><br><b>style</b>There is only one key value pair that can be set for the target_temp_entity. It's called <b>style</b>. What is does is specifies the sprite that will be displayed. <b>These values MUST range from 17,18,20-22 or there will be an error and the game will crash.</b> I am not sure if there are any other values other then these, these were the only  ones I found to work. <br><br> Another thing you should know is that style 22 is the only one used in the id levels and is the only one that has a sound that is played when it is triggered. Style 20 and 21 <b>MUST</b> have a target_speaker used to get sound(if you want sound). Here are some screenshots of 3 of the different styles: <br><br> <center><img src="/tutorials/quake2/tutorials/target_temp_entity/20.jpg" width=300 height=225 border=0 alt="style 20"><br>style 20<br><br><img src="/tutorials/quake2/tutorials/target_temp_entity/21.jpg" width=300 height=225 border=0 alt="style 21"><br>style 21<br><br><img src="/tutorials/quake2/tutorials/target_temp_entity/22.jpg" width=300 height=225 border=0 alt="style 22"><br>style 22</center> <br><br><b>17</b> is the rocket explosion, <b>18</b> is the gernade explosion.(thanks obama) Uses of the target_temp_entity - <br><br> This entities uses are visual and just for looks but very very cool. You could have big generators that give off the electrical cloud of style 22. You could have a trap that would set off a target_temp_entity under the feet of the player and disintegrate him. There are numerous cool and unique uses for this entity that all of you guys/gals can up with.</blockquote> There is an example of the 3 different styles on the <a href="rusttemp.zip">example</a> map.<br><br> if you still don't understand please post your questions to the <a href="http://forums.gamedesign.net/forums">discussion</a> board.<br><br>
