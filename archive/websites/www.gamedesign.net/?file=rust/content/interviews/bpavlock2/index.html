               <font class="title">							Interview with Bobby Pavlock of Rogue Entertainment 						
						
			
<blockquote>	

<b>Rust: </b>When we last caught up with you, you were working on the long-awaited Ion Storm title Daikatana.  Since that time, you have left Ion Storm and gone over to Rogue Entertainment to work on American McGee's Alice.  Tell us what kind of challenges you faced in this change, in terms of level design.
<br><br>
<b>Bobby: </b>Well, I guess the most obvious difference is working in the Quake3 engine with Alice, as opposed to working with the Quake2 engine with Daikatana. I had to learn all the new functionality available in the Q3 engine, like curves, and shaders and such, but with the help of Brandon James and the other designers here at Rogue, it was a fairly seamless transition.  
<br><br>I also had to adapt to the new method in which designers approached constructing a level here at Rogue.  At Ion, designers had almost complete creative freedom with the levels, almost to the point of having TOO much freedom.  By that I mean there wasn't a whole lot of structure, or a real organized plan of attack for building DK levels.  For Alice, before we even lay a brush, we sit down and plan out the entire level's flow, puzzles, etc. and list out all the resources we are going to need for the level, whether it be art or programming-related.  Once all that is complete, only then do we sit down at the computer, look at our plans for the level, and begin to actually lay brushes.  We still have the creative freedom to design the look and feel of the level how we envision it, but it's just a more structured approach, which I like.
<br><br>Other than that, the only challenge was to try to measure up to the level of talent of the designers we have here at Rogue.  
<br><br>
<b>Rust: </b>What, in your opinion, are the coolest new features of the Quake 3 Engine, and what are the most difficult features to grasp?
<br><br>
<b>Bobby: </b>Curves, of course are alot of fun.  There's so many things you can do with them.  Sometimes I find myself just playing with all the different curves and curve functions, seeing what kinda cool, new things I can come up with.  Another thing I am really enjoying is being able to cram more detail into an area.  I am able to design areas in Alice using the Q3 engine that would NEVER fly in Q2 r_speeds.
<br><br>I haven't completely grasped the full functionality of shaders yet.  But I'm trying to learn what I can slowly but surely.  Our scripting engine for Alice is another thing I haven't really delved into a whole lot as of yet, but in time I plan to learn that inside and out as well.
<br><br>
<b>Rust: </b>What is your design process like at Rogue?  Describe how you get from the concept to the finished product.
<br><br>
<b>Bobby: </b>Well, I think I kinda explained this a little bit in Question 1, but I'll go into a little more detail about it.  
<br><br>When we're preparing to start a level, the first thing we do is get the ENTIRE design team to sit down and brainstorm until we come up with an overall gameflow for the level.  We discuss everything from puzzles the player will have to solve, to points of environmental and/or monster interaction, to ambient details that will help create the mood and feel we want for that particular level.  Once that brainstorming session is done, then the designer actually building the level will sit down and draw out a detailed overhead view of the map and list what happens when and where throughtout the level.  After that, we type up a list of art, programming, and scripting needs that we're going to need for the level.  Once all that is done, then the designer who is going to be handling the architecture for that level is ready to sit down and start laying brushes.  When I say the "designer who is going to be handling the architecture for that level", what I mean is this...
<br><br>Here at Rogue we have decided to approach level design as more of a "team" effort, as opposed to a level being the work of one designer.  We're using more of an assembly-line approach.  Some of us are stronger in architecture, and some of us are stronger in scripting/lighting/detail work.  The "architecture" guys will go through and construct the level architecture, and when he's done, he'll hand it off to the "detail" guys, who will go through and do all the scripting, detailing, lighting, etc.  This works out really well as every level benefits from the strong points of the entire design team.  This also helps all the levels have a more consistent look and feel, and most importantly to me, helps prevent us from getting burned out from working on the same level for too long.
<br><br>
<b>Rust: </b>What will set Alice apart from other Quake 3 engine games, as well as the other action titles coming out over the next year?
<br><br>
<b>Bobby: </b>We are going to great lenths to exploit the whole "Wonderland" setting as much as possible to give Alice a look and feel that has never been seen before. The last thing we want is for Alice to look like just another shooter.  >From a design aspect, we are approaching every level, and, in fact, every single brush we lay from an aspect of "what can I do to make this look different, or 'Wonderland-ish'", for lack of a better term.  We want the player to constantly be walking around going "What the f--k were these guys on when they made this game?"  :)
<br><br>There are, of course, plenty of other fun little things that we have planned, but I can't go into any of that stuff yet.  
<br><br>
<b>Rust: </b>Do you see level design becoming more of a group effort as game titles become more complex?  In other words, do you think the trend will be towards having a level being passed around from one person to another during the design process?
<br><br>
<b>Bobby: </b>Heh, see question 3 :)
<br><br>
<b>Rust: </b>What tips would you give to amateur level designers to improve the quality of their work?
<br><br>
<b>Bobby: </b>My advice would be to go through and really study the levels produced by both professionals and many of the top amateur designers.  Scrutinize every last detail, from brushwork, to texture usage, to lighting, sounds... everything.  Then go back into your levels and *honestly* critique your work.  Look for both what you do the same as the top designers and, more importantly, for the aspects of your level that you seem to be lacking in, and try to emulate what the top designers have done in their levels to elevate their levels to that next level.  Also, one of the most important things IMO, is to try to  do something to distinguish your levels from the rest of the countless levels being produced every day.  Do something original.  If everyone is using a similar theme or design for their levels, then try to come up with something new that noone has done.
<br><br>I use this example often, but it illusrates my point effectively...  When Q2 first came out, everyone was making levels using the "Base" texture set. Level after level that I saw on review sites was a base level.  So I decided to be different, and do my first level ('Ad Mortem') using the Q2 "palace" theme.  Upon release, it received extremely high praise for being something "original".
<br><br>So you see, it doesn't have to necessarily be anything mind-blowing to be different.  I have always found that cookie-cutter levels come and go, and the vast majority of them, even many of the good ones, are quickly forgotten.  But if you can come up with something that offers something different from the norm, those are the levels that will stick out in people's minds over time.
<br><br>
<b>Rust: </b>Final thoughts?
<br><br>
<b>Bobby: </b>Love the site.  Keep up the good work.  
<br><br>Thanks for the interview.  Hope it helps.  :)</font>            </td>
