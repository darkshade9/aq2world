<h3>Interview -  Greg Barr, Soldier of Fortune Level Designer for Raven Software</h3>

<p><hr width=75% color=black noshade>
<br>

<b>Rust: </b>First of all, tell us a little about yourself and how you made it to Raven.
<br><br>
<b>Greg: </b>Born in Scotland a mere 27 years ago, I have moved around and lived in more places than can be good for any normal person. As far as I remember the tally is up to 21 homes now.
<br><br>Prior to working at Raven and in-between education I worked on the "Eve" CD-ROM for Real World Multimedia and several projects for Workhouse Interactive as a designer, programmer and part time sound technician.
<br><br>My education laid the foundations for where I was heading even though I was not aware of it at the time. With a background in Fine Art, a Masters Degree in Computer Graphics and Animation and an ongoing hobby interest in gaming and programming you would think I would have noticed.
<br><br>I was keeping myself busy dabbling making maps for Quake2 (which had just come out) while seeking jobs in the CG industry. It was quite by chance that I spotted a story on Blue's that mentioned Raven was looking for designers. On a whim I sent Eric (Biessman) one of the levels I was working on at the time. After that things moved fast for a while and then very, very slowly as I waited for my visa to clear. That was a long eight months.<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What challenges did you face in creating maps for Soldier of Fortune?  Did it take some time to get used to the genre?
<br><br>
<b>Greg: </b>Aside from the challenges that every map faces a couple of extra things came up with SoF. Real world scale was the first thing we all noticed when making the maps that took a little bit of adjusting to. Doorways could no longer be 6 feet wide and 12 feet tall in order to allow the player to move cleanly through. The challenge was to present realistic environments and yet allow players to move around unrestricted. This was accomplished with rigorous clip brush application and carefully playing through and watching folk play through the levels and refining areas where problems were occurring.
<br><br>Certain areas called for by the design doc were simply at odds with the engine. The train level I was responsible for and Scott McNutts Iraqi Refinery both had very large open areas with a long line of sight. Oddly enough the tools were not happy about this at all. For these levels Rick Johnson designed a system to allow us to set a distance cull in the worldspawn. These maps would now cull architecture out after the distance specified no matter what the tools had to say. This combined with fogging to hide features popping into view allowed us to pull this off. I was very happy with the result even if the train did take forever to compile.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Describe your design process, from the general idea of the map to the finished product.  Do you draw the map out first, or just fire up the editor?  Does only one person work on a map, or does it get passed around?
<br><br>
<b>Greg: </b>This would depend on the kind of level I was working on. For instance for a deathmatch level I tend to sketch out a simple layout in Radiant then run around and get a feel for the space, look for connections, hotspots and possibilities for adding features. As weapons, pickups and features (parts that move, open, traps if any) are added I will throw in ideas and look again at how they gel. I nearly always do deathmatch maps in this 'freeform' way. Detail can then be added as a last touch when the playability is locked down.
<br><br>In a single player situation the process is very different, your considerations are different and there are other factors to consider. There may well be a need for consistency from adjoining levels, both in layout and look of lighting and texturing. On paper rough work is very much an essential part of the design. A few sketches can save you many hours of lost time when planning a puzzle or designing the interconnection of an area. A paper reference also helps a great deal in conveying ideas to other members of the design team more effectively.
<br><br>Almost every map included in SoF was worked on by more than one person. Certainly each map was largely designed initially by one person but others were involved throughout the process.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Did you work on maps for any of the in-game cut scenes, and if so, were there any challenges specific to those maps?
<br><br>
<b>Greg: </b>Although I didn't work on the maps we made specifically for cutscenes a larger portion of the cutscenes in the game took place without changing levels. When adding a cutscene to a level your goals are to portray all the content in the most appropriate manner, preserve continuity and stay within the resource budget for the level. Balancing these three factors is the tricky part. For instance some scenes required the building of a 'stunt double', part of the map which has been duplicated and yet the player can never enter that section, it is only seen through the eyes of the cutscene camera. If you need to use a trick like this, for example the Big Gun exploding in the Kosovo mission, can you afford to duplicate that part of the map and still stay within file size and entity count limits? You can help yourself by trimming all sorts out of the scene, removing backfacing objects and simplifying distant objects. This is all well and good but continuity should still be preserved if at all possible.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What kinds of changes do you expect to see in game design over the next few years?  Do you see the need for more people working on one level in order to create more detail?
<br><br>
<b>Greg: </b>As far a the design of the environments in which games are set I am sure we will see more detail, prettier effects, higher polycounts and all that technical stuff increasing as time goes on. There comes a point where you have to examine how long the person playing your game is spending in one particular area.  At that point if is wise to asses if the time and effort required to make that spot look the absolute best it could can be justified when perhaps that time could be spent adding other content. If you are playing a fast action game is it worth adding that fifth spoke to the wheel of that burnt out car you just ran past at 30 miles an hour when 99 percent of players never even glance that way? Again it is about balance, if environmental detail should be balanced with pace. In a slow game or area it pays to spend longer refining, in a high-speed tunnel chase time is better spent elsewhere.
<br><br>As for the fundamentals of the game design itself rather than the subset that is world building. The recipe is the same as it ever was and is likely to remain that way. Introduce your player to exciting situations, test their reactions, get friends to play and see how they react. Does a particular puzzle or combat situation frustrate them? Are they breezing through too easily with no challenge? Look again and adjust what you have until most folk are having fun. This is a tried and tested method that works well. That said, innovation is an unpredictable as it is interesting. You never know what is coming next.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What do you think is the most difficult aspect of level design?  
<br><br>
<b>Greg: </b>The most difficult thing is knowing when it's finished. There is always that one thing you would like to add or improve.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>If were giving advice to an amateur game designer, who wanted to work for a game company, what would it be?
<br><br>
<b>Greg: </b>Learn a little of everything and learn a lot about the area you like the best. Having an understanding of how each part of a game fits together will go a long way in your day to day work.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Any final thoughts?
<br><br>
<b>Greg: </b>Thanks for the tutorials when I was starting to learn QuakeEd.</div>
