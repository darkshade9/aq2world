 <title>RUST's Current Status</title>
 <link>http://www.gamedesign.net/node/1404</link>
 <description>RUST | gamedesign.net is in bad shape. Recently we had our forums closed due to inactivity and since most of the staff members are working full-time in the game industry we don't have enough people to update site. Today I had to delete 5 users which were spamming the site and numerous spam comments. I see that we have atleast 70 users online all the time and I hope that you guys still find this site useful.
&lt;p&gt;
If any of the staff members is reading this, hit me up at yanostretsov[at]yahoo.com so we can go over the future of RUST.

 <title>5th Annual Come Back To KP Weekend</title>
 <link>http://www.gamedesign.net/node/1234</link>
 <description>&lt;i&gt;"Every year around this time &lt;a href = "http://www.kingpinforever.com"&gt;Kingpinforever.com&lt;/a&gt; organises a Come Back To KP Weekend. This year the weekend will commence on Friday 27th October and run through til Sunday night 29th October. 
&lt;p&gt;
This is a weekend when we encourage as many ex-KP players to come and mix it with the current crop of KP fraggers. Basically we try and get as many people (both old, current and new players) playing as we can. 
&lt;p&gt;
For it to be a total success though, we need you guys to help spread the word to every one on your contact lists and through your email. We want to get in touch with as many ex-players as we can and get them to re-install KP and come back and play. Everyone at KP4Ever will be doing their utmost to spread the word and help make the weekend a success. 
&lt;p&gt;
It's just over one week away so there is time to get organised and start spreading the word but what better time than right now."
&lt;/i&gt;

 <title>Google offers Free 3D modelling program.</title>
 <link>http://www.gamedesign.net/node/1227</link>
 <description>&lt;a href="http://sketchup.google.com/"&gt;Google Sketchup&lt;/a&gt; is a simple 3d modelling program aimed mainly at making content for Google Earth.  However there is more power in there than that.  The program can export models in several formats including 3DS and VRML and may be a good free way to get into modelling your own game content.  From the &lt;a href="http://sketchup.google.com/"&gt;Sketchup site&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://sketchup.google.com/"&gt;SketchUp&lt;/a&gt; is a simple but powerful tool for quickly and easily creating, viewing and modifying your 3D ideas.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on a shape and push or pull it to create your desired 3D geometry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiment with color and texture directly on your model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real-time shadow casting lets you see exactly where the sun falls as you model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select from thousands of pre-drawn components to save time drawing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <link>http://www.gamedesign.net/node/1219</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;
I have released the first fully public 'sneak peak' for Quake 10 Year.  Quake 10 Year is a project to remake every Quake Asset in high end graphics.  The project is using LordHavoc's Dark Places - the most advanced Quake 1 Engine available.  The project uses advanced shaders, high resolution textures and assets.  The project is to celebrate Quake's 10th Birthday.  You can see a glimpse &lt;A HREF="http://www.quake10year.com/"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.  When the next official public release is announced, RUST will be the first to know about it!
