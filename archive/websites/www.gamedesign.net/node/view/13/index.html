<h3>Gard</h3>
<p><b>Position</b>: News Updates, Content Editor, Forum Administrator</p>
<p><b>Bios</b>: Firstly, I dont think I should be at the top of this list, as I want to make the best damn book ever. That is right a book. I'm still working on the design, but have put that aside for six months to finish my PhD and get this web site restarted. I got hooked on editing when I discovered that QuArK editors and have mainly edit for Quake III Arena (Wolv helped me first). My images are more about the look I want and not so much the game play. Although the idea of generating a movie in Game (Machinema) intrigues me a lot, and when I have the time (when this site is fixed), I will spend more time playing around with editors that will let me make a short film. That is ofcourse when I have upgraded the book, and submitted it for publication. In the real world, Im a geologist GIS expert who refines computer models to better target mineral deposits, such as gold. So far I haven't found a gold deposit yet, but who knows what will happen tomorrow. I enjoy this research because its like looking for buried treasure hidden by nature.</p>

<h3>Jherax</h3>
<p><b>Position</b>: Site & Technical Administrator</p>
<p><b>Bios</b>: I've been mapping off and on for the past couple of years working with different mod teams. After doing a stint running the content end of Rust, now I'm spending my time working on the technical aspects and working on developing and maintaining the back end used to run the new Rust. I'm working I'm a student at Bowling Green State University and working towards a degree in Visual Communications Technology.</p>

<h3>Olpainless </h3>
<p><b>Position</b>: Forum Administrator </p>
<p><b>Bios</b>: Well, I've been around Rust and it's forums 4-5 years, so I have a pretty good understanding of what goes on, and what should go on here.  I've had forays into Half-Life mapping, with a distinct lack of success (I go through hard disks through butter, mostly when I'm about a week away from finishing a project), and I've took up webdesign and programming as my fields of interest. You really want to know more about me? Check out www.olpainless.net, if you so feel. </p>

<h3>Tycho </h3>
<p><b>Position</b>: Forum admin and moderator. </p>
<p><b>Bios</b>: I discovered web scripting a few years ago and that lead me all the way to Object-orientated programming (mainly C++). I have a big passion for game- and web design/programming and I pretty much spend all my computer time with stuff relating to these. I've been mapping for half-life for about 2½ years also. I have not yet released anything, mainly because I'm too big of a perfectionist to approve my own work (and when it turns out crap, I get a new idea, and just move on). My real-life details would probably bore the hell out of you, so I won't bother writing them here. </p>

I started designing levels after I got my hands on Kingpin: Life of Crime in 1999. I began working on unofficial sequel to KP, entitled Kingpin: Final Crime, in 2003. During development of FC, I joined RUST | gamedesign.net, where I work as Administrator, News Editor and Forum Moderator.</p>

<p><b>Bios</b>: 
My <a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/book/view/554"><b>Resume</b></a> pretty much says it all, but I still wonder sometimes how I ended up here... I mean, one day I was worrying about recycling grey water, and the next I was an Administrator.<br>
Oh well, now that I am here I fully intend to use everything I have learnt running other sites to make this the best Gaming Design site ever..<br>

<h3>Entium </h3>
<p><b>Position</b>: Moderator, Programming </p>
<p><b>Bios</b>:Just a little bit about what my company and I am doing. We are game developement company, that is creating a very fast and robust 3d engine. Currently working on our first title Terra Firma: Havok. I've been programming for over 13 years now, with about 8 of those years in graphics programming, only the last 2 years in 3d. Also on the side been doing 3d art for around 11 years. I never really liked working under others so I haven't presude any jobs in the game industry. This is our first really big break for my company and co-workers. I would like to give back so of the knowledge that I have developed for over the past 13 years to the game developement community. If you want more info about our games and technologies please visit our website. </p>

<h3>KaMiKrAe-Z </h3>
<p><b>Position</b>: Forum Moderator </p>
<p><b>Bios</b>:According to my info I joined here a little over 2 years ago in 2001, so I'm pretty damn new school in that respect, and I joined out of my love for quake2 which was my first true foray into FPS' (only a little earlier in that same year) and sparked my interest in editing. I havenâ€™t released a map yet, but I've spent the time mastering all of the basics and generally playing around with "stuff". I havenâ€™t really tried editing for anything else, maybe I will after I release a map or 5.  In Real Lifeâ„¢ I'm 18 and Iâ€™ve just finished my first year of Industrial Design, and while it is a broad profession Iâ€™m heading towards furniture design. </p>

<h3>Knightmare </h3>
<p><b>Position</b>: Quake2 forum moderator </p>
<p><b>Bios</b>: Started mapping for Q2 about 5 years ago, when I finally ditched my crappy Cyrix for an overclocked PII. Produced a 4-map unit (not yet released). Became frustrated with the entity limitations in Q2, and then merged the source for the official mission packs and Lazarus. During coding this mod, also became frustrated with limitations in the Q2 engine. Upon release of the Q2 engine source, immediately set about "booming" the engine (Boom was a Doom engine mod that drastically increased that game's mapping limits) to increase the limits and fix bugs that most annoy mappers. Current projects: KMQuake2 engine/GPL Lazarus and Pax Gold Edition. </p>

<h3>Mazemaster </h3>
<p><b>Position</b>: Forum Moderator </p>
<p><b>Bios</b>:I started editing Half-Life maps in 1999, and quickly found my way to the RUST forums. These were really the first internet forums I visited regularly, and as such will always feel like home (aww, how cute). With practice and help from the whole community here, especially Merl and Wolv, I became a proficient mapper.  Anyways, at first I was only interested in making 3D walkthrough mazes, of which I made many, cluminating in the preposteriously difficult megamaze, but over time I shifted towards regular level design. I have created many maps for HLSP, HLDM, CS, and various other Half-Life mods. My 3 most popular maps are King of the Castle (KotC HLDM), Megalith2 (HLDM), and de_nightfall (CS), whereas my personal favorites are Catacomb (HLDM), deviant_sn (HLDM), and rc_redrock (HLRally, mod unreleased).  I love to tinker with mapping and create new effects or combinations of entities that no one has seen before, such as making a random events generator in Half-Life with env_beams, or creating a motion blur effect by intentionally and strategically creating a HOM (hall of mirrors) "error" in certain places. These days I am getting into modeling, coding, and 2d art, all three of which I am slowly but surely becoming proficient at. </p>

<p><b>Bios</b>: I am ancient. I first got into video games when I got an Atari 2600 for Christmas 1978 (Yes I did mean that ancient). After a couple of years of irritating begging I got my first computer, a Tandy/Radio Shack TRS-80 with a massive 4K of RAM. Being a precocious little sod I quickly learnt the Z80 assembler and made my own version of Space Invaders. However, computer games at this time did not live up to my expectations. The technology did not catch up with my imagination until the release of Wolfenstein 3D (I don't have a great imagination, I dream in 16 colour EGA). Then when Quake and Quake 2 came out, with real freedom of movement and easy to use tools, I got hooked on mapping and found RUST. I've made maps for Quakes I, II & III, Half-Life, Thief & Thief II, Kingpin, No-One Lives Forever, Unreal and Deus Ex. I have only released one of them, a DM map for Quake II, which I considered marginally less crap than the others. I plan to map for Half-Life 2, Doom III, and Quake IV and I'm looking forward to those games immensely. In real life I am a full-time carer. My wife, a psychotherapist, is ill and needs daily help due to life-long asthma and several complications. I am also a part-time, freelance writer and editor. I am a non-smoker with a good sense of humour and my own car. </p>

<p><b>Bios</b>: I started editing maps around the Wolfenstein years. From the silly little "put your box wall here" map editor I graduated up to Doom, then to Quake, Quake 2, Half-Life, and finally started editing for Unreal and Unreal Tournament when it came out. Been tinkering with the Unreal engine for a while now and have done mapping, texture work, and coding for different things Unreal and UT. I've a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Information Systems - so obviously I gravitated toward games  My favorite apps are naturally Photoshop and 3DS Max and I spend quite a lot of time with them. The latest project I've worked on is the Godz modification for UT and UT2003. Not bad for a nearly 30 year old  </p>

<p><b>Bios</b>: About 5 years ago I started playing Q2, it didnt take long for me to find QuArK and try to make my own maps. For years it was just for a laugh and make silly maps to just play with my friends. Along the way I did learn a thing or two about QuArK, and how the Q2 engine likes its maps best. Ive never made any (finished) DM maps cause Im too much of a detail sucker to come up with something I find good enough to actually release. A couple of years ago I made #QuArK on quakenet and started helping out people with the editor, giving them tips and making small example maps to give them more insight on how to use entities. At about the same time I got involved with the Q2 mod 'Jump' that was coded for and hosted by Jolt. After a while i became admin there. As you all know Jolt has ended their Q2 support, so at that time I found a new host, made a website and transferred the entire Jolt jumping comunity to the new domain. Since Pooy, the original mod coder ended the jump project as far as his coding for it goes, it was me who kind of became the mod runner. So a new team was assembled and today the mod is still doing good with a dcecent server load and player comunity.  I was also (rcon) admin for wireplay for a while for Q2 KotS (king of the server) mod, untill they pulled the plug on that one.  My goal as far as games, internet and comunity goes, is to try and help keep my little corner of Q2 as alive and active as I can.  I may have found a new coder for a biggish project Ive got planned for the JumpMod, so Im hoping this will work out. 
Its nothing much, but Im just doin' me lil part  </p>

<p><b>Bios</b>: Since Doom 2 I have been trying to get my fingers into games and see how they tick, and run. I love games and i have loved editing them. The feeling of making something and playing it after a long days of work is the most satisfactory feeling i have ever had. I have edited for Doom 2, Quake, Quake 2, Quake 3, Unreal, Half-Life, Counter-Strike, Team Fortress Classic, and some other games. I got into 3D modelling in 1999 and have been focused on that field more than anything. I have worked on 4 games (non completed under my belt as of yet). I only have 2 public maps out, and not a single 100% completed model. Though i know what I am doing, i have a problem with not finishing what i started.... </p>

<p><b>Bios</b>: Well, I took my first dive into mapping back during the Quake I era. I really didn't know what the hell I was doing though until I started mapping for Half-Life. I tried to release a few multiplayer maps but never really had a chance to because I didn't have the time or patience. Even though I don't map anymore (although I have thought about getting back into it, who knows...), I still hang out as a regular at the Rust forums (so much, in fact, that they decided to make me a moderator). I also like to dabble around with Adobe Photoshop 5.5 every now and again too. Right now though, I'm attending college. I'm looking at getting my AA at a community college and then transferring over to a university (FSU baby!) to get a major in business with a minor in computer science. </p>

<p><b>Bios</b>: I have no distinguishable talents but, after being in mapcore for over 4 years and making myself rememberable character by being a sarcastic ass to people and talking about animated japanese schoolgirl rape, I've managed to get a higher status within the mapping community than I deserve. While I did take the time to learn the ins-and-outs of mapping, and edited Quake and Quake 2, I never get around to finishing anything and have a total of 3 maps under my belt - all released at communities that wouldn't reject them due to their size. Suckers. However, now I've decided to 'play more serious' and as a result I took up Warcraft mapping and got myself a position where I be a sarcastic ass to the moderators of Gamedesign.net so they work harder. I also like to craft cheese into amusing shapes. </p>

<p><b>Bios</b>: After some tinkering with Doom II maps way back I didn't do much editing for quite a while until I went to university and got internet access. I found this nifty little editor called QuArK and started mapping a little for Quake II and later for Half-Life, the latter being the only game where I ever finished a map for.  Later, Gard got me involved in editing for Quake III, with its much better visuals and possibilities of more complex maps, but I found the gameplay rather lacking, so didn't attempt making any playable maps for it. New building plans in my neighbourhood showed me the real-world possibilities of Quake III and I created a virtual reality of the area with the newly planned buildings. Although a bit too late in the decision making process it did help to lower and move some of the buildings. So far I haven't succeeded in persuing this "VR" making at a non non-profit basis though. Right now I mostly hang out at the Natural Selection forum, drooling over the maps but never actually building one. </p>

<p><b>Bios</b>: I started mapping for Dark Forces (the first Star Wars FPS for all you unenlightened) back in 1995 but the engine was crappy and the editor even crappier (look I made up a word). Discouraged by the limited editing capabilities of Dark Forces I put by creativity towards gamemaking aside until 1998 when a little know game called Half-Life was released (you may have heard of it) and have been hooked on editing ever since.  One problem I have with editing is that I am like a kitten and am distracted by shiney lights and objects very easily and have completed very little.  But soon I will unlease my masterpiece upon the world, and they will gaze upon it's magnificence.  What? Fine I'll put my pants back on.</p>
