Alright...Today's victim:  a Mr. Tim "Argh!" Wright, mastermind of the Arghrad program.  If you want more information on what Arghrad is, then check out Wright's homepage, <A HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/arghrad/">RadiosityLand</A>.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>RUST</B>:  So, Tim, how would you describe yourself ?  What do you do for a living, and what would we find you doing if we came over this Saturday?
<BR>
<B>TIM</B>:  I don't know, I think I'm a pretty boring guy.  I guess I'd consider myself both an artist and scholar.  Ugh, that sounds so pretentious.  I'm a bit of a sci-fi and cartoon geek.  I listen mostly to classic rock (especially progressive like Yes, Rush, Pink Floyd, etc.), and 80's music.  I'm preoccupied with 1985.  Most of my current hobbies involve computer games, playing or tweaking.  My work history is kinda random, though I've had a few cool game-related gigs.  Most recently, I've been doing contract work creating 3D logo images for a corporate project.  Don't know what I'm doing this Saturday...got any fun ideas?
<BR>
<BR>
<B>RUST</B>:  Maybe, but I don't think my internet girlfriend would like it.  Alright, when did you first discover Q2, and were you immediately attracted to playing around with radiosity (methods that calculate the value of light between all the surfaces in an game environment to produce more realistic lighting)?  Most people just mod, and yet you created Arghrad?  Got some kind of light fetish?
<BR>
<BR>
<B>TIM</B>:  [LAUGHS]  I've been interested in game design just about as long as I've been playing them.  Heh, I remember doodling new Atari 2600 game ideas in my sketchbooks as a little kid.  I have worked on more traditional mods for various games, although the lighting tools have certainly been my most popular projects.  I already had lighting experience from an art & computer graphics background, but Doom sparked my particular interest in game lighting.  Then Quake's arrival was like a lighting revolution.   However, despite the advances, I wished it was more flexible like most 3D rendering programs.  Others began releasing versions of Light.exe that separately offered unique new features.  That finally inspired me to unite these mods with my own into a single program, Arghlite.  I originally started work on some more advanced features like sunlight under Quake.  When the Quake 2 source was released, switching to an enhanced Qrad3 just seemed like the right move and Arghrad was born.  A special "shout-out" to Geoffrey DeWan who really kept me on my toes in those early days!
<BR>
<BR>
<B>RUST</B>:  Cool.  What other skills or experience do you have regarding computers and software?  Like, what kind of programming do you do?  And, how did these impact on the development of Arghrad?
<BR>
<BR>
<B>TIM</B>:  I started programming fairly young, at a time when home computers were still relatively uncommon.  Apples, T.I.s, and Commodores, Oh my!  [LAUGHS]  I've also been into computer graphics just as long, though it's funny to recall what passed for "state of the art" back then.  I do have formal computer education (BFA Computer Graphics), but I'd say most of my computer knowledge was self-taught.  For instance, I learned C by becoming a coder for a text-based MUD.  Which has recently been resurrected at telnet.anonymud.mine.nu 6969, by the way.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>RUST</B>:  You guys can check that out after you finish reading this interview first though.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>TIM</B>:  Yeah.  But, I have a number of computer interests beyond programming; mostly art-related like 2D & 3D imaging/animation, digital photography/video, and even audio production.  That's why I love game development.  It's a single subject which incorporates many of my different interests.  Arghrad is a good example of that.  It's a programming project designed to build a better set of artist tools.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>RUST</B>:  Yeah, art is great.  I love to make music with my ass, but no one else apperciates it.  Anyway, Arghrad has been around since 1998, so this is its sixth year.  How have you maintained interest in developing this software and what benefits do you get out of this work?
<BR>
<BR>
<B>TIM</B>:  I think the multi-year gap since the last major revision answers that question.  I do keep coming back to it though.  It's annoying to me when I leave my old to-do lists unfinished.   I also love being able to give something back to the community that I've gotten so much from myself.  Especially if it may encourage others' creative efforts.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>RUST</B>: Now Tim, do you have any future plans to add more features to Arghrad besides the more recent ones?
<BR>
<BR>
<B>TIM</B>:  I'd like to increase max map limits for Quake 2 engine ports before the full 3.00 release.  After that, I plan to port the 3.00 changes to all the other game versions.  I always wanted to add some kind of plug-in special effects system, but I doubt I'll ever get to that.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>RUST</B>:  Well, all us game geeks with be praying for you.  But, is there a absolute limit to a certain effect you can add to Arghrad, such as phong shading?  You always say your making the effects better each release, so is there a limit to how much better you can make them?
<BR>
<BR>
<B>TIM</B>:  There are some strict limits due to the engine's data formats.  Also, there are practical limits where things just aren't worth the cost in development, effort, or compiling time.  Most of my recent work has been bugfix-related or ways to enhance lighting quality within the bounds of these limitations.  I guess the real limit is when I run out of practical ideas.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>RUST</B>:  What are some of the most creative things you have seen done with Quake 2 and Arghrad; things that made you glad you did all that work?
<BR>
<BR>
<B>TIM</B>:  Wow, I don't know where to start!  I get the warm-fuzzies every time I see sunlight and phong shading used well in a map.  I hope people will keep on making great Quake 2 maps, and try out some of the cool new features like transparent shadows. And, I'd particularly love to see them used in some new singleplayer maps.  Hint, hint...
<BR>
<BR>
<B>RUST</B>:  What's the "Hint, hint..." for?  Anywho, do you interact with the people at ID Software, or have you interacted with them before?  Do they ask you questions about Arghrad?
<BR>
<BR>
<B>TIM</B>:  Heh, I recall writing to ID for some Arghrad advice and got something like "What's an Arghad?" in response.  <LAUGHS>  But, generally, they've been very helpful when I've talked to them.  I've had very good experiences dealing with other ID-related companies, too. Hell, Raven Software and Ion Storm were always especially cool.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>RUST</B>:  Awesome.  Alright, just one last question:  what's your favourite ice cream?
<BR>
<BR>
<B>TIM</B>:  Breyers chocolate!</div>
