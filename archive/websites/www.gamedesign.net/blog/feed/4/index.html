 <title>Something completely different, numero uno.</title>
 <link>http://www.gamedesign.net/node/1055</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, as the title suggests, this little blog entry will be something completely different - a little more personal in nature. Just a short thing, this, to let you know I occasionally have things going on that aren't Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well, as some of you may or may not know, I'm currently undergoing teacher training - this is progressing smoothly, and I may be doing some full lessons in the near future, which should be interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, I may have a nice new job lined up. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, my own college course is proceeding rather well in general, and hopefully this'll continue - it's only a few months until I've finished, so crunch time is coming up, mind you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And last but not least, my Flash game is proceeding very well, I've got proper shooting and collision detection code in, although some bugs are yet to be ironed out - including one very interesting bug that is eluding me, and may end up getting an article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh, and speaking of articles - when the game is done, expect a deluge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, thats all from me for today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Some more general improvements...</title>
 <link>http://www.gamedesign.net/node/1018</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I've created a new filter for you all to use when posting stories - the appropriately enough named &lt;strong&gt;Story HTML.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an expanded set of tags from the filtered HTML, which will allow you far more choice when formatting the articles contained within the site, and should hopefully provide for the ability to write more interesting articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the mod team, I've also modified full HTML so it DOES not format line breaks naturally - please be aware of this when you're using this filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and of course, we have a new content provider/moderator, yesukai - who again deserves a rather large thankyou for the sheer volume of content he's providing us with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>So, whats next for Rust?</title>
 <link>http://www.gamedesign.net/node/996</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well... as you know, I'm often tinkering around with the backend of this site, enabling new features and getting things as smoothly as possible - whereas I don't atually post articles beyond the point of 'Sorry this went wrong - fixing it now - fixed'.&lt;br /&gt;
But, my lack of article posting shall be discussed another time, for this particular entry is about the future plans for Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I'd like to see Rust reclaim its former glory as King of the Amateur Gamedesign Community, although that will need a great deal of work; in the short term, I'm always looking to improve the functionality of the site, and next on my hitlist is some forum work thats been pushed to the back burner over some more pressing concerns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Well well, we have a blog system, working.</title>
 <link>http://www.gamedesign.net/node/991</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After the little mishap with the books/blog modules clashing, I believe everything is sorted, and that makes my life much easier - this place is occasionally a git to run, but its worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a note, I hope you all enjoy, and indeed use, the new blog feature; as long as you don't abuse the general Submission Guidelines, we're happy for you to use this system for most things you can think of - and if there is a problem, just ask.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
