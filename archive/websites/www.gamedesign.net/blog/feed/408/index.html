 <title>Ok, Back</title>
 <link>http://www.gamedesign.net/node/1141</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After an exceedingly long time away, I have returned to complete an article I had sitting in the que for... a few months now.&lt;br /&gt;
http://www.gamedesign.net/node/1068&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from that... I dont know what else I'll do in the meantime. I don't have my computer with me, havnt for a few weeks (im staying someplace else), and even if I did, I have been using Linux a lot. End result is, I just don't have Halflife installed, and its hard to make tutorials without the game installed But fear not. I'll think of something to add. :)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>dm_mortiza</title>
 <link>http://www.gamedesign.net/node/1061</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I've got myself on a "you are going to publish a map or I will kill you" kick, so I've been working all day on dm_mortiza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic map premise is to make an indoor map that doesn't use any lights besides a light_env. This is because.. well, why the hell would there be electricity at an old research station anyway? :P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far its going well, with a lot of rounded arcitechture. However, I am in a bit of a pickle over what to put in the second main area. I have an entrance to the tunnels, then half the room is just empty right now, waiting for something. Hmmm...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, if you want to s&lt;/p&gt;

 <link>http://www.gamedesign.net/node/1060</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I looked up "inactivity" in the dictionary earlier. It sayeth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in·ac·tive   Pronunciation Key  (n-ktv)&lt;br /&gt;
adj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   1. Not active or tending to be active.&lt;br /&gt;
   2.&lt;br /&gt;
         1. Not functioning or operating; out of use: inactive machinery.&lt;br /&gt;
         2. Not being in continuous use or operation: an inactive brokerage account.&lt;br /&gt;
         &lt;strong&gt;3. Not creating the articles you should be for Rust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
   3. Retired from duty or service.&lt;br /&gt;
   4. Chemistry. Not readily participating in chemical reactions; inert.&lt;br /&gt;
   5. Biology. Marked by the absence or reduction of activity, such as the ability to cause infection.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Entity Guide</title>
 <link>http://www.gamedesign.net/node/1030</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My son woke me up at 5:30AM after I went to bed at 3:00AM. What, you ask, is so important as to stay up so late? Why, a half-life 2 entity guide, of course! I just worked on it a bit more, tweaking the styles. I think it has a nice clean look now... of course I could be wrong, I have only had 2 hours of sleep. Rust staffers can look at it in the submission que, please dont approve it yet. I want to add as many articles as I can (a couple days worth) before it goes public, no sense in losing userbase early with incompleteness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am going back to bed and hoping my son stays asleep for at&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Tutorial to Bring in New Users/Why Time is Important</title>
 <link>http://www.gamedesign.net/node/1021</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm getting a lot of questions/views of the prop_physics tutorial due to &lt;a href="http://www.chatbear.com/board.plm?a=viewthread&amp;#038;t=544,1111839075,11865&amp;#038;id=823608&amp;#038;b=4990"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; thread in the VERC forums, apparently, a lot of people needed to know how to get a prop from start to finish. I am attempting to get peeps into posting the comments here and not in that thread, however. Anyone with questions/comments (4 people so far, 90 thread views) should provide plenty of new sign-ups/user base for Rust if I can steer them over. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funniest part is the very same article (with a few technical inaccuracies ive since fixed in the Rust version) has been sitting in the VERC editing que for a week now, with none of the editors over their even bothering to check, except Hugh. Good 'ol Hugh. Oh well, you snooze, you lose.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Visual Studio .NET 2003</title>
 <link>http://www.gamedesign.net/node/1014</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend at the tech college came through for me again, this time with a cheap copy of Visual Studio .NET 2003. I love it so far, compiles the source code without any errors or any damn workarounds. Just pure, clean "lets get down to business" coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this mean for you guys is the same outcome as me learning XSI and the new HL2 ents: As I learn something, it get put into a tutorial. The more I learn, the more tutorials Rust gets. :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im going to start with something easy for my first mod; some guys in IRC were nostalgic about Runes for Quake, so I figured, hey, that sounds easy. So, I'll be making a ruins mod for HL2MP, and, even better, I'm going to heavily document it so that I can make tutorials about my experience. An entire mod creation, all down so you can follow along (after im done of course, dont want to lead people down the wrong path when I screw up. :) ). But that should make an interesting load of articles for HL2-&gt;Coding.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>New Article</title>
 <link>http://www.gamedesign.net/node/1007</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;About to go to bed, but I just finished another article, this one about prop_door_rotating. THe only thing is... when I try to upload an image, The little table that shows the images screws up and doesnt dipsplay the whole path the image, and never shows more then 1. I uploaded the images to imageshack for easy get to, but some higher up is going to have fix that kind of stuff. :)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Op</title>
 <link>http://www.gamedesign.net/node/1005</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Haha. I bitched enough about the formatting that they made me an op to shut me up. ;P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, though, this is awesome... I haven't been an op at a site worth knowing about since... I had a slip of the tung with autolycus... 3 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, im sure lots of people had a council on it or something, and I'm not quite sure who to thank (hell, im not even really sure about the hierarchy of Rust), so just post a comment and I'll thank you. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to write some more tutorials. One thing I will do, is instead of just submitting a tutorial strait into the page, I will submit it to the&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Wow, people actually care</title>
 <link>http://www.gamedesign.net/node/1000</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Its wierd... I am so used to stuff at the VERC, where it takes weeks of naggin to get anything done. Over here, not only do (some) people actually read what Im writing, but people get articles through quickly. Too bad you guys dont have anywhere near the ammount of traffic im sure you did in the old days.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Blog</title>
 <link>http://www.gamedesign.net/node/995</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well well well. What have we here. Another site offering a blog. I'll add it in next to my real blog, http://yesukai.blogbear.com, and perhaps even my &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; editing site blog, http://collective.valve-erc.com/index.php?blog=yesukai .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I can post Rust related stuff/ramblings here; instead of the off-topic forums where someone might actually read them, I can post them here so no one ever sees them. Or, on the off chance that I become a popular rustian, perhaps someone might look in here. Hmm. So, I better provide some content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I have more articles to submit, including one that follows the creation of a prop_physics, all the way from model to compile. Bound to be popular, as "how to do the entire process" articles are. However, I dont really think that the formating options available to article creation are sufficient to render the article, as it has many images that need to have thier float values set, etc. Only way it would work here is to have full HTML/CSS abilty, or complex formatting codes.&lt;/p&gt;
