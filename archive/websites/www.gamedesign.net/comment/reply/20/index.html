			270 to the South. -1 is up, and -2 is down. Also, there is a bug with the trigger_push

			Attenuation = -1 works fine for non-looped sounds. Looped sounds are always attenuation

			across the entire map:<br>
			1) Find the duration of the sound using Sound Recorder or other audio program. If the .wav

			don't have a pak editor to do this, a good one is qped, available from
			www.planetquake.com/qped.<br>
			2) Add a func_timer to your level, with the &quot;start on&quot; spawnflag. The wait value
			of the func_timer should be set to the duration of the .wav file. Target your
			target_speaker with the func_timer. (David Hyde)

			First make sure your .wav file is mono rather than stereo. Create a custom directory
			for your custom sounds so that you don't get confused about what sounds came from who or
			where. All sounds must go somewhere below baseq2\sound, so create a subdirectory
			baseq2\sound\mysound, for example. In the .map, reference the sound including the relative
			path below baseq2\sound. For example, the noise field of your target speaker would be
			&quot;mysound/mywav.wav&quot;. Note the forward slash rather than a backslash. (David

            Unfortunately, you cannot make just one big brush with a 90 degree bend in it. It must
            be made of smaller separate brushes (you can later group them in you editor). This is
            because the Quake engine cannot handle concave brushes. You can check if a brush is
            concave in your head like this: Think of one of the vertices in the brush, and see if you
            can make an imaginary line to another one, where the line goes outside the brush.

        <li><b>Can I have moving lights in my Quake 2 level?</b><br>

            Not without coding or using a mod that supports it. The original Quake 2 engine doesn't
            allow the default light entities to move. The Quake 2 Mission Pack: The Reckoning,
            however, has a rotating_light entity.

            You can't. The func_train entity in Quake 2 can't rotate around an axis. Like the
            rotating light question however, it all depends on how an entity is coded. Hexen II, for

            this or find a mod that has one.

            The &quot;sparks&quot; themselves are actually the target_splash entity. However, as
            the entity name implies, this entity needs to be targeted in order to work. Typically, the
            target_splash entity is targeted by a func_timer entity, with the random property set. See

            A point entity is an entity that doesn't require a user-defined model to work. For
            example, a monster is an example of a point entity since it has a pre-defined model
            associated with it. A solid entity, however, requires the editor to manually define a
            brush to be associated with the entity. For example, a door entity is an example of a
            solid entity. The editor has to define what brush (or brushes) make up the physical door.
            If a solid entity is not associated with a brush, a PF:SetModel = None error or something
            similar when the level is started.

            The func_water entity isn't required for static pools of water or water with currents.
            It's a specialized entity used for rising/falling water that's activated by a trigger or

            This occurs when the Origin brush hasn't been properly grouped with the rest of the

            own method of grouping or use the func_group entity, so check the documentation or

            toggle spawnflags. Both func_walls have the same targetname. The button targets both
            func_walls, and their visibility flip-flops.

            It basically makes certain animated texture animated. Animated Fast makes it animate
            faster than normal. However, it should be noted that this does only work with certain
            textures, for example, e1u2/keydran1_1(&amp; 1_2). Other textures may not show any effect

<h3>Compiling, Leaks and Errors</h3><br>

	<ul type="square">
		<a name="37">
        <li><b>Every time I try to compile my map with the latest versions of qbsp3.exe or any
            of the other compilers, it crashes and I get some message saying that the program
            performed an illegal option or something to that effect. How do I fix this?</b><br>

            You don't have enough virtual memory for the compilers to finish (they're hogs, so you
            have to give them plenty of room!) Go to Control Panel, System, Performance, Virtual
            Memory. Turn off letting Win95 (or Win98) handle the swapfile and switch it to be located
            on the drive with the most free space. It's not unusual for the compilers to need 100Mb to
            500Mb of free space, depending on the size of the maps. <br>
            <br>
            Unfortunately, if you don't have that sort of room you've got 2 choices:<br>
            -delete some stuff (and run a disk defrag afterwards)<br>
            -get another hard drive.

        <li><b>After compiling my level, I notice that I can see &quot;through&quot; the sky
            into another room in my level. How can I keep this from happening?</b><br>

            First, make sure that you've done a full VIS which sometimes helps clear up this
            problem. Also, you can use a Hint brush between the player and the sky.
            However, sometimes these methods won't clear up the problem, so you have to always
            consider this when designing your maps. Plan ahead and if need be, use blocker walls
            and the like to help obstruct the view into these areas.

        <li><b>My level takes ### hours/days/weeks to compile. Am I doing something wrong? </b><br>

            This is a next-to-impossible question to answer. The fact is that how complex your
            level is determines how long it will compile. And this means how complex your level is to
            the Quake engine, not your perception of complex. If your level is taking longer than you
            think it should, you need to understand WHY it's taking so long. Things like texture
            lighting, large open spaces, etc. can all dramatically increase the time it takes to
            compile a level. See the Tutorials and Style pages here at Rust for a better idea of how
            to create good levels.

            level disappear at certain angles...what causes this and how can I fix it? </b><br>

            In most instances, a full VIS compile on the level will correct this. Typically, this
            solves the problems. However, if it occurs after a full compile, you've probably got an
            area that's far too complex or big for the Quake2 engine to handle. In which case, you'll
            have to simplify your level.

        <li><b>Why is my map always/never lighted, even though I place entities? (I have a
            leak, btw) </b><br>

            Check your maps for leaks during the BSP compile. If you see the message
            &quot;***Leaked***&quot; any time during that compile, then the VIS and Radiosity
            compilers will not take effect. Hence, the level will either be completely dark or
            fullbright.

		<a name="42">
        <li><b>Ok, I checked and my map doesn't leak, yet it's still not lighted, even though I
            place entities? </b><br>

            Be sure you're running the compilers in order. The proper order is QBSP, then the VIS
            compiler, finally the Radiosity compiler (which handles lighting). Additionally, make sure
            ambient light is set to zero or a decimal value.

            Entities are not calculated during the radiosity compile, so they can't block light.
            So, you get a &quot;leaking&quot; effect since the Q2 engine and light compiler
            pretty much act as if the door isn't there. Unfortunately, there is no way to
            actually prevent this from happening, so you have 2 options: either move the light far
            enough away (or decrease its intensity) from the door or put an offsetting light on the
            other side of the door for a more gradual lighting effect.

            No, a -level # parameter used with the VIS compiler will be ignored by the compiler for
            Quake 2. The -level 4 parameter for the VIS compiler DID improve the quality of
            Quake 1 maps, but with Quake 2 the parameter is ignored. So, while it can be
            specified, it won't actually make any improvements to the maps (nor will it have any
            adverse affects.) It's merely a carryover from the Q1 days.

<h3>Advanced Questions</h3><br>
	<ul>
		<a name="50">
        <li><b>How do I configure difficulty settings for my levels?</b><br>

            A lot will depend on the editor you use. However, difficulty settings are
            configured for entities by the use of spawnflags. If you have to manually enter the
            spawnflag values in your editor, the values are as follows:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Not in Easy=256
				<li>Not in Normal=512
				<li>Not in Hard=1024
				<li>Not in Deathmatch=2048 (not needed for monsters or other items don't appear in DM
					mode)
			</ul><br>
            These values can be combined. For example, if you have a monster that you want to appear
            ONLY in Hard, the spawnflags would be set to 256+512=768.

		<a name="51">
        <li><b>What are Detail brushes and when should I use them?</b><br>

            Detail brushes are used to help speed up the compile time by &quot;hiding&quot; those
            brushes from the compilers. Since the QBSP compiler breaks up a brush if another
            brush intersects it, this means that a lot of brushes may be created. Detail brushes
            can be used for any brushes that do <b>not</b> block the player's line of site.<br>
            <br>
            This is taken from a text file included with the gamex86.dll source code. The author is
            John Carmack.<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>
            <i>The basic idea is that you should make all of the brushes that aren't major occluders
			into detail brushes. This lets the vis program ignore all of the little protrusions that
			never really block sight. Because of the factorial order of the vis algorithm, it is
			pretty easy to get a 10x speedup in vis time by making the non-essential brushes detail.
			This also gives a method to fight some of the errors that still occur in bsps. If polygons
			are dissapearing in the game, but they come back with &quot;r_novis 1&quot; set, then
			there is a vis error. This can usually be fixed by making more of the brushes between the
			problem viewpoint and the problem polygon into detail brushes.</i>

		<a name="52">
        <li><b>What are Clip brushes and when should I use them?</b><br>

            Clip brushes are often used to keep a player from getting stuck along a wall, floor or
            ceiling by any brushes that protrude from those surfaces. For example a light
            fixture or a column. There are two methods for using Clip brushes:<br>
            -Create a triangle and put it flush with the sides of the protruding object and another
            side on the wall. This allows the player to be &quot;moved out&quot; slightly when
            moving along the wall.<br>
            -Create a rectangle Clip brush that covers the whole length of the wall and is out far
            enough to cover the edges of the items sticking out of the wall.<br>
            Both methods were used in the original Id levels. Using Clip brushes is <strong>strongly</strong>
            recommended for multiplayer maps.
