				<h4><br>a. The Painter</h4>
				<p>Thru the tutorial I used <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe PhotoShop</a> but have tried to keep my language generic enough so that you could use any graphic program with similar capability. Speaking of which, here's links to a couple. There's probably more out there, but this is just to get you started.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The Gimp</a><br>It's a some-what cross platform, GNU Licensed, 32bit painting program. I've used it a little bit, and it's a GTK interface similar to GTK Radiant. It's a multi-windowed interface (not master-window like most windows programs), but seems to be very powerful at least on the level of Paint Shop Pro. Best of all, it's freeware.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.jasc.com">Paint Shop Pro</a><br>Some would call it a poor-mans Photoshop. At only $100 (it's only money right?) it will give you 80% of the features of Photoshop without the extra 80% in $$$. Also good for low memory systems (64mb)</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe PhotoShop</a><br>Industry Standard, does everything, $600. Nuff Said.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Either way if you decide to use something else, you need these features:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>32 bit (will do alpha channels)</li>
					<li>Layers. Preferably unlimited.</li>
					<li>Can save in several different file formats. You'll be using TGA, which is an uncompressed bitmap, and JPG with is compress 24bit bitmap (no alpha channel)</li>
					<li>Different blending methods (multiply, overlay, screen, etc) for subtlety.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In other words, Windows Paint AINT gonna cut it (=</p>
				<p>Instructions in the tutorial will remain as generic as possible. This is so anyone using any of these programs can do what they need to do without having to decipher instructions for another editor. The problem with this is if you're unfamiliar with the program you've chosen it may take you a while to find the feature that I mention. Sorry but ... well... sorry.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<h4>b. Image Viewer</h4>
				<p>You'll need something to look at the images you have, and if you really get into texturing you'll need something to browse your library. Once again, there's probably more out there.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.irfanview.com">IrfanView</a><br>A nice mix of features between the other 2, plus the extra added bonus of being able to view movie types. It's freeware and bannerless of all things...</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.mindworkshop.com/alchemy/alchemy.html">Graphic Workshop</a><br>It's shareware and can view some 60+ image formats. Good for low memory systems. It can also do a bunch of other things like scaling and thumbnail catalogs. </li>
					<li><a href="http://www.acdsystems.com/index.htm">ACD See</a><br>It's Nagware meaning that every now and then, when viewing an image, you'll get a popup that tells you how many images you've viewed, tells you where the website is and nags you like a Lovey Howell about buying it. Tis cheap but EXTREMELY functional and another one of those `standards'</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If you have other programs in mind, all you need is something to show you .jpg and .tga images. Tiling, cataloging, etc, is a nice extra but not completely necessary.</p>

				<h4>c. Base Images<img id="Picture2" height=256 width=256 src="../../Building_Custom_Textures/Texture_Tools/MetalDsk_2.jpg" vspace=0 hspace=5 align="RIGHT" border=0></h4>
				<p>In order to build a texture you have to start with some of these. </p>
				<p>A base image is usually a picture of something pretty general. Typically they're not tiled and are devoid of too much diversity. The whaled iron here is a good example. It's a boring pic, but can be used to detail a game txtr.</p>
				<p>There's a&nbsp; link here to take you to a page with more than 70 links to sites with textures. I've taken a look at most of them and they appear to be good resources.</p>
				<p>Thanks ``some guy i know" for originally posting this list to the rust forums.</p>

				<h4>d. Setting up the editor</h4>
				<p>Now these aren't things that you HAVE to do, but it certainly makes life easier.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Turn on the Grid at 32<br>Mine is set at 64 with 4 divisions, and I can quickly select any power-of-2 sized</li>
					<li>Turn on snap to grid.<br>For this tutorial, grid snap is a must.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Ok good. . . now that THAT is done, on to the meat and potatoes.
