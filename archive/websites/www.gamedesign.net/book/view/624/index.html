  <h3>Properties</h3>
   <p><b>Target</b> -  When the entity is activated, the Target named here is triggered.</p>
   <p><b>Name</b> - The Name of the entity.</p>
   <p><b>Render FX</b> -  The options are as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
        0 = Normal<br>
        1 = Slow Pulse<br>
        2 = Fast Pulse<br>
        3 = Slow Wide Pulse<br>
        4 = Fast Wide Pulse<br>
        5 = Slow Fade Away<br>
        6 = Fast Fade Away<br>
        7 = Slow Become Solid<br>
        8 = Fast Become Solid<br>
        9 = Slow Strobe<br>
        10 = Fast Strobe<br>
        11 = Faster Strobe<br>
        12 = Slow Flicker<br>
        13 = Fast Flicker<br>
        14 = Constant Glow<br>
        15 = Distort<br>
        16 = Hologram (Distort and Fade) <br>
</blockquote>
 <p><b>Render Mode</b> -  Options are:</p>
<blockquote>
  0 = Normal<br>
  1 = Color<br>
  2 = Texture<br>
  3 = Glow<br>
  4 = Solid<br>
  5 = Additive <br>
</blockquote>
 <p><b>FX Amount</b> - The value of the Render Mode, between 0 and 255. <br>
  'Solid' mode simply needs a non '0' value to work, while in other modes translucency is controlled by this value.</p>
 <p><b>FX Color</b> - An RGB value that controls the colour of the object  rendering. Only Color and Glow Render Modes use the Render Color property, but other entities also use it under different SmartEdit names.</p>
 <p><b>Pitch Roll Yaw</b> - Sets the pitch (up / down), yaw (left / right) and roll (bank) respectively. The compass in WorldCraft / Hammer corresponds to Yaw. The settings are not always (or not all) used.</p>
  <p><b>TriggerTarget</b> Used to trigger a seperate Target in conjunction with the Trigger Condition.</p>
  <p><b>Trigger Condition</b> - This controls the condition under which  a monster will trigger its TriggerTarget.<br> The options are:</p>
<blockquote>
         0 = No Trigger<br>
        1 = See Player, Mad at Player<br>
        2 = Take Damage<br>
        3 = 50% Health Remaining<br>
        4 = Death<br>

  "Extremely anti-social, your temper is prevalent in nearly every situation.
  This results in fierce battles where you and your adversary eventually fight  to the death.<br> 'Anger management' is NOT part of your vocabulary or life-style.
  Your prolific reproduction rivals the growth of any bacteria. In the space of  minutes you have spawned several hundered offspring. Your tiny progeny immediately  displays the aggressive nature that is so ingrained in your own psyche. You  are prone to having microwave accidents."<br> -SlayerA<br><br>

<b>Notes:</b><br>
The most common occurence of these guy's is included in the monster_osprey. But they are equally good value dropping from ceilings and cliffs. Place the monster entity at the point you want them to drop from, Their rope does not extend past their start point as the animation starts, so careful placement is necessary so that they don't look 'odd'.<br><br>

<b>Notes:</b><br>
Careful placement of the path_corners ensures a smooth looking flight path. The path_corners will need to be tweaked to adjust pitch, roll and speed.<br> This entity needs a lot of room to fly in. It also drops monster_grunt_repel based on the number of grunt_repels added initially.<br> The resupply occurs when the grunt's are killed, based on where they were initially placed in the map.<br> Make sure you have a path_corner over the grunts!! as this is where the Osprey will head to drop new ones when they die. <br><br>
