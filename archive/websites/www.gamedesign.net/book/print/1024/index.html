<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">Half-Life 2 offers a vast number of entities to work with. The sheer amount of entities can be boggling, and how to properly use them can be confusing. Presented here are the entities, organized in an easy to use fashion. We will only be offering in depth articles on entities. You can safely assume that if an entity has an article, it will be a complete tutorial on how to use that entity, not just a list of its keys.

<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 5px;">
<ul>
<li><b>What is a FGD?</b> FGD stands for Forge Game Data, its the file that tells WorldCraft/Hammer what entities are available and what properties they have.</li>
<li><b>Why isn't your guide complete?</b> We are going for quality over quantity. When an in-depth tutorial is made for a certain entity (or entities), links will be added for it. If you would like to write a tutorial for an entity, you may do so. Simply <a href="/user/register">Sign Up</a> and then check out the <a href="/node/943">Submission Guidelines</a>.</li>
