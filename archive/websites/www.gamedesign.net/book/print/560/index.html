<b><i>- NAME:</i></b> <a href="emailto:panzer@quakequad">Rob Berwick</a><br><br>

<b><i>- ALIAS:</i></b> Panzer<br><br>

<b><i>BIOGRAPHY:</i></b></br> 
I became interested in mapping way back in 1998 while stationed overseas.  It started with Quake 2 and after returning to the US in 1999 I eventually got around to finding a download for Q3Radiant.  I worked with it for about a year before I realized the amount of options in Q3A was just too daunting to work with and during that time, I stumbled across a small Quake 2 community, <a href="http://www.bdmcnet.com/forum/">Backshooters</a>, who warmly welcomed me into their house.  I had the benefit of learning more about Quake 2 mapping from mappers like Maric and Sven.  Over the next two years I built my skills using QERadiant and began releasing maps in 2001.<br><br>

<b><i>- MAPPING INTERESTS:</i></b><br> 
As I stated above, I have loved working with Quake 2 and am looking forward to working on some Doom 3 maps.<br><br>

<b><i>- SKILLS:</i></b><br> 
QERadiant, GTK-Radiant, Wally and PhotoShop<br><br>

<b><i>- WORK:</i></b><br> 
To date I have released only one level for Quake III Arena which wasn't all too popular but a lesson in and of itself.  I have also released six levels for Quake 2, some of which have been modified for the <a href="http://q2database.com/downloads/awaken2-mappack_2.zip">Awaken 2 mod</a> for Quake 2.  I have been involved in beta testing some code for the Awaken 2 mod but my heart is in mapping and that is where I suspect it will stay.<br><br>

<b><i>- WEBSITES:</i></b></br>
I own <a href="http://www.quakequad.com">www.quakequad.com</a>, but at this point, it's more of a storage room than anything else...so don't expect to find anything if you go there!<br>
<br>

<b><i>- OTHER:</i></b><br> 
I think that is pretty much it...except that I am a homicidal maniac and by hiring me for anything you are only jeopardizing your safety and that of your other employees...families...and pets...especially the pets!  ;)<br><br>
