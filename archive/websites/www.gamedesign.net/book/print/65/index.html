<B>Rust: </B>Tell us a bit about yourself, and the company you work for.
<br><br>
<B>David: </B>I'm Dave, and I make levels. I'm nobody special. I work for Legend, the most ass-kicking company around next to Victoria's Secret. Legend is working on Wheel Of Time, the game that will make you cry like a baby and bark like a seal for more, and Unreal 2. Oh, and there's the level pack for Unreal, too.
<br><Br>

<B>Rust: </B>UnrealEd. You like it a lot. Why?
<br><br>
<B>David: </B><i>"...it gives me the POWER!!!!"</i><br> - Shane Caudle
<br><br>
Seriously, though, I really like UnrealEd a lot. I'll admit it still needs work, but it's currently good enough to keep me from looking at the current crop of level editors (and I used to be a hardcore Worldcraft user =)
<br><br> 
As I wrote in a recent article comparing some of the (engine-specific) level editors, UnrealEd is a wonderful editing tool that is not to be taken lightly. I won't go into details, it's just an experience you have to discover for yourself I guess.
<br><br>

<B>Rust: </B>Do you have any comments on the supposed death of the Unreal editing
community?</b>
<br><Br>
<B>David: </B>Hmm, suppose I haven't been following close enough to see this actually. I have noticed that most of the veteran level designers from the Quake days haven't produced any work for Unreal, either due to lack of interest or the learning curve it brings (those level designers who weren't hired that is.) If there is a "supposed death of the Unreal editing community" I would say it's due to the lack of creative and inspiring work that we saw with Quake. Before you fire up that flame email, let me explain. I do have rather high standards, but for me to really say 'cool map' it has to be something that is at least as good as what shipped with the original game. To date, I do not believe there has been more than a small handful that have done this, probably 5% of what's out there now. And the maps I'm referring to were done soon after the game shipped. Not everyone makes maps with the intent of getting hired in the industry, but it is often those designers who pave the way for the ones who enjoy mapping purely for fun as they provide ideas and inspiration to continue editing for the game.
<br><br>

<B>Rust: </B>What do you forsee in the future of level design?
<br><Br>
<B>David: </B>Level designers with VR helmets, sculting worlds with VR gloves. Yeah right! God, I hope not. Then there wouldn't be much of an editing community because no one would be able to afford the equipment =)
<br><Br>

<B>Rust: </B>Do you take ideas from movies, other games, and real world objects, or do you try to be completely original?
<br><Br>
<B>David: </B>Sometimes I take ideas for events from movies, but rarely. For actual architecture (esp. Unreal) I tend to decide what kind of structure is needed, then just flesh out from the faint images in my head.
<br><br>

<B>Rust: </B>If you where still a member of the none paid editing community, what game would you be editing right now?
<br><br>
<B>David: </B>Unreal, and probably even Quake.
<br><br>

<B>Rust: </B>What do you think is the most important trait of a mapper trying to get into the industry?
<br><br>
<B>David: </B>Professional quality of his/her work. I can't emphasize this enough. I'd rather play one amazing map then 100 horribly made levels.
<br><Br>

<B>Rust: </B>If you could go back and change one thing in your map making career, what would it be?
<br><Br>
<B>David: </B>Not release my first 6 levels =)
<br><br>

<B>Rust: </B>What’s is your favorite level that “you” made?
<br><br>
<B>David: </B>They all suck! Well, I don't really have a favorite (yet). If I'm proud of a level I've done then it's just one of my favs.
<br><br>

<B>Rust: </B>Thanks for your time :)
