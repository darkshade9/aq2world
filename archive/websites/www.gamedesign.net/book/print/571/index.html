<p>Since Quake3Arena doesn't support Ladders, we have to make stairs or Jumppads. I'm going to show how to make very easy stairs. We have our map, as before. It should look something like this:</p>

<br>
<p>Now we want to reach the upper level, by making a stair. The first thing I do is to select the floor texture by pushing the middle mouse button on the floor in the 3D view. Then I make a new box that is 128 units long, 16 units wide, and 8 units tall. I copy this new box, by pushing <Ctrl> + C, and then paste a copy of it by pressing <Ctrl> + V (the new copy will be on the same place as the original one, so I move it a little bit. After doing this twice, so I have three boxes, my stairs have started (you don't follow what I mean, do you =), probably not), It should look like this now :</p>

<br>
<p>Now, lets continue, by making more steps. Copy the objects till you reach the floor. It should look like this when you have done this :</p>

<p>Tada, the first really basic stairs are done. Now you can change the texture on the top of each step to make it look really good, place two boxes on the side of the stair and so on. If you didn't get what I meant, give me a note.</p>
