<p><b>Rust:</b> First of all, tell us a little bit about yourself and your position at Digital Extremes.
<br><br>
<b>Bastiaan:</b> I am a 21-year-old guy working as a freelance mapper, currently for Digital
Extremes. I am born and raised in the Netherlands, and did my high school
there, called Havo. Afterwards I started doing contract work, and am still
doing so now. At Digital Extremes we are working on Unreal Championship,
which is going to kick ass! 
<br><br>
 
<b>Rust:</b> Has working as a professional in the gaming industry changed your views of gaming at all?
<br><br>
<b>Bastiaan:</b> Not really so much the gaming, but definitely the things that go on behind
the scene. It takes so much effort to make a game and get it out to the
public. The mean thing that makes a game successful in my opinion is fun. A
game must be challenging and fun at the same time. Working as a professional
taught me to see the things that attracted me in games, or pushed me away
from a game. Defining what is good and what isn't is really important,
because you don't want to make the same mistake someone else did.
<br><br> 

<b>Rust:</b> What do you feel is the most important part of level design?
<br><br> 
<b>Bastiaan:</b> Balance, definitely balance. Gameplay is about balance, fast action but also
time to catch your breath and get a weapon. The balance in visuals as well, good
visuals are great but too much isn't good at all, balance in lighting with
dark spots and light spots. I could go on forever :) A good level will
usually go through many versions, and lots of testing.
<br><br> 

<b>Rust:</b> What limitations do you feel hurt you the most when designing game levels?
<br><br>
<b>Bastiaan:</b> The usual limits for speed, but most of all I think time will limit me in
making maps. If we had more time to make levels we could polish it more and
add little details. But on the other side its good that we have the time
pressure, then we know it will get done ;)
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> As professionals in the industry, what is the most common mistake you see in amateur maps?  What’s a common mistake you see other professionals make?
<br><br>
<b>Bastiaan:</b> Not so much a mistake but I think the UT community is missing a bit of
originality. Most good maps tend to look the same, and were built in the
same fashion. The editor gives you endless possibilities, it’s just coming up
with the ideas. About the other professionals, I don't think I have enough
experience to comment on something like that.
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> When it comes down to pre-planning your levels, what do you do?
<br><br>
<b>Bastiaan:</b> Thinking, drawing, thinking, trying stuff out in the editor, talking about
the ideas with other mappers here. Sometimes the best thing to do is set
your brain to 0 and just start making something without thinking too much
about it. A very nice experience I had was speed mapping, trying to make
something in an hour, I was very surprised with the results :)

<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> What first sparked your interested in becoming a level designer in the game industry?
<br><br> 
<b>Bastiaan:</b> Making worlds, creating environments. I always loved that. I had played many
games, and had dreams of making my own as most other kids have, I wanted to
make a real-time maze, very simple stuff. Then I read in gaming magazine
about level editors, and how easy UnrealEd was to use. So I bought Unreal
and gave it a shot. The editor didn't run though, so I left it, till I got
the internet and got the editor going. That’s when I started playing Unreal1
multiplayer, started to enjoy that, got a lot of support while trying my
hand at mapping, and the urge to become better, to make better maps was what
got me in the business I guess. I never intended, my goal wasn't to get in
the business, but to make great levels :)

<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> What were you doing before you worked at Digital Extremes? What do you envision yourself doing after your stint at Digital Extremes?
<br><br>
<b>Bastiaan:</b> I was in school before I got to work here, and I haven't got a clue what
will happen after this big adventure, I guess I take live by the day and see
what happens :)

<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> While you’re not designing games, what are you doing in your spare time?
<br><br>
<b>Bastiaan:</b> Free time??? Hehehe. I play games here on the LAN. A lot of Quake 3 RA, and
UT. Then all kinds of other games that come and go. I also love to go out
and just listen to birds and look at the pond behind the office, lots of
frogs, fish, muskrats etc. etc. out there.
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> What sources do you use for inspiration? 
<br><br>
<b>Bastiaan:</b> Everything. Everything I can get your hands on. Moving, drawings, paintings,
concept art, real live architecture and well, I could go on forever :)
