<b>Rust: </b>First of all, tell us a little about yourself and how you made it to Legend.
<br><br>
<b>James: </b>Well, I made several Quake 2 single player maps which people seemed to enjoy, and was hired by a small company in Texas called Revenant. That project was in the midst of financial difficulties after I worked on it for about 6 months, so I started talking with Glen Dahlgren, designer of Wheel of Time, and I took a position at Legend working on WoT. That was about eighteen months ago.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What are the differences between making a map for Unreal 2 and the Wheel of Time?  
<br><br>
<b>James: </b>We have new technology and capabilities constantly being added to the engine, but this was also the case with WoT. We just have to adapt to new features as they become available, but it’s an ongoing process. Essentially, we started Unreal 2 with the capabilities we ended with on WoT, and have advanced from there.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Are there any difficulties in creating the sequel to Unreal?  Do you find there to be any limitations on the types of things you can do because of the original, and does Epic have a lot of influence on your designs?
<br><br>
<b>James: </b>I don’t find any difficulties specific to the Unreal universe. Epic has seen most of our designs to this point, and has been happy with them. Epic is really easy to work with and very laid back. They put a lot of trust in Legend’s design capabilities. We value that confidence, and work hard to maintain it by doing the Unreal Universe justice.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Describe your design process, from the general idea of the map to the finished product.  Do you draw the map out first, or just fire up the editor?  Does only one person work on a map, or does it get passed around?
<br><br>
<b>James: </b>Personally, I sketch a lot of ideas for a map, and try to sketch out a layout of the level’s flow. These are simply a framework though, and the final map will tend to differ from these initial ideas. It definitely helps, though, to focus my efforts when I use this approach, and I try to minimize wasted time this way. I’ll start actual editing with these concepts in mind, and refine both the map itself and my concept sketches as the level solidifies. This is a sort of ongoing process that never really ends until the map is complete.
<br><br>
On Wheel of Time, we tended to pass maps around as schedules change and people are needed on other tasks, although every level had a primary owner who did the majority of the work on that map. I expect the process to continue this way, although so far we’ve all had total ownership of the maps we’re working on.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What feature(s) of U2Ed do you think the Unreal mod community will like the most?
<br><br>
<b>James: </b>I think mappers will really appreciate the clipping tool, and the little touches that you will notice, such as drag-box selection, proper cursor marks, and windows customizable to personal preference. The new editor is much more a tool that level designers had a strong hand in designing than the first iteration of Ued.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What are the biggest challenges for you in making maps in general, or specifically for Unreal 2?
<br><br>
<b>James: </b>I find the biggest challenge when making a level to be planning, as in “what will this encounter become, 6 months from now?.
<br><br>
To me that’s the true challenge of simultaneously developing the levels while code, art, and assets are also underway. It’s a tight juggling act keeping these various aspects progressing smoothly together.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What kinds of things will a person who played and enjoyed Unreal be most impressed with in Unreal 2 (either overall or in terms of level design)?  What would you say to a player who was not a big fan of Unreal to influence them into purchasing Unreal 2?
<br><br>
<b>James: </b>People who loved the scale and beauty of Unreal I will appreciate these same aspects taken to the next level. We’re creating some environments that should really amaze those looking for a sense of wonder and adventure in a single player game. However, we’re also keeping a strict eye towards fast-paced action, and we’re devoting tons of attention towards making the AI and encounter dynamics very intense.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Does Unreal 2 have as much variation in level designs as Unreal did, and if so, what kinds of challenges does that present to you as a level designer?
<br><br>
<b>James: </b>Unreal 2 has a lot of variation in environments, but the story is far more developed than in Unreal 1, and the environments reflect this. The locations are all quite large, and fit logically into the story. There are many planets to explore, each with very unique settings. The challenges are many, more so than I can or should expand upon at this point. :)
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Any final thoughts?
<br><br>
<b>James: </b>I hope these answers are what you were looking for. Expect a lot more specific info on Unreal 2 to start popping up soon. Development is fully underway. :)
