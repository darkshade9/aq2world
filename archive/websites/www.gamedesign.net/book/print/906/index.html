Part of the fun of making maps to Quake III Arena (Q3A) is that the technical aspect of level editing is as smooth as possible. Q3Map Explorer (Q3ME) was built for making it as easy as possible to compile the map file, but still enable advanced mappers the freedom to edit the command lines generated by the program.
