<b>Rust: </b>For those that don't know, tell a little about yourself...who are you, what do you do, etc.
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>Hell0, my name is Sten &quot;ztn&quot; Uusvali, I'm the guy who makes those always the same looking maps.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Out of all the levels you made, which is your favorite and why?
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>That would be ztndm3 - &quot;Blood Run&quot;. I can't put my finger on any specific detail, the whole map just appeals for me somehow. 
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Typically how long does it take you to make a completed level?
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>Uh, that really depends on various factors. I don't &quot;map&quot; every day, only when I feel like. For example, I finished Painkiller's layout in one night, as opposed to my latest piece which has taken more than a month and I'm not even near completion. Probably the most inspiring factor is a good set of textures, not too many of them and not too few either.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Do you design out anything on paper first or have a general idea of what you want? Or do you just open an editor and 'go to work'
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>I have tried pre-design my maps but that took me nowhere. When I start, I usually have a pretty clear vision of what I want, though, the result *always* turns out to be quite a different. It is just much more fun  to start laying brushes and trying different combinations...something which can't be accomplished on the paper.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What are your thoughts on the FPS games that are nearing completion like Sin, Half-Life, Daikatana? Do you see yourself doing any level editing with these games?
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>I am, of course, looking forward to playing those games and if any of them will provide a good deathmatch, I most certainly will try to make a dm map for that game. At the moment, it's pretty sure that I'll be making dm maps for SiN.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What are some of the most common mistakes you see other amateur level designers make?
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>Bad scale and poor connectivity. There ain't nothing more boring, not even Hansons, than those maps with a pair of huge-ass rooms and long tunnels between them. On the strong second comes the bad connectivity. I mean, the map shouldn't look a Swiss-cheese either, but the player should have multiple choices to gain access to various items. 
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What would you consider the most difficult aspect of level design? Easiest?
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>Easiest...making a cool looking architecture. Most difficult...making it run fast.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Where do you get your inspiration?
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>From Headshot's maps of course =) No...well...from everywhere...movies, books (see, I can read), buildings...everywhere. However, believe it or not, the main source of inspiration for me still is the classic Quake's DM4 - &quot;The Bad Place&quot; [ztn visits the Volcano God] =)
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Youâ€™re one of the best around at making good-looking maps while keeping the number of textures and faces down. Any tips on how you do so much with so little?
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>Uh, that's a difficult question. Can I skip it? No? Ok...I first build a very detailed and slow-ass map. Then, after the main layout is hammered out and I have a clear view of what I have, I start optimizing. That means I sometimes have to scrap a great deal of cool looking details, rooms, even areas in order to bring the r_speeds down to the playable level. Sometimes if that won't be enough, I have to rely on some perverted tricks to restrain the r_speeds. To see what I'm talking about, load up my &quot;Fury&quot; and look around the main atrium with the gl_showtris turned on (you'll have to have an OpenGL card, 3dfx as it is won't do the trick). The other not-very-widely-used-but-effective technique is using special textures. Say what? Well, take a look at the custom textures included with my dapak12 (or ztndm6) and you'll understand.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>How much of that is done with lighting?  Any tips?
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>Lighting is a powerful tool adding depth and atmosphere without increasing the face count. Way too many potentially good maps look &quot;flat&quot; just because of the poor usage of light. And contrary to the popular belief, maps don't have to be &quot;dark&quot; to look good. (Well, look who's talking ;) Ok, I admit, lower light level adds a lot of feel and atmosphere...but try to avoid pitch black areas, especially on the floor. As for any tips...try not to use completely white light. Make the light a very little beige or warm yellow, that way it looks more natural. Also, two words: spotlights. It's easy to overuse them, but when used properly, they'll add a great deal of feeling to the map.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Are there any things you try to keep in mind while designing the flow layout?  Any things you deliberately put in or stay away from?
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>There are buttloads of things to keep in mind when designing deathmatch maps. One of the rule I always try to follow is that you should try to keep the player on a constant fear. Whatever technique you might use to accomplishing that, the main rule is that it should add the fun, not take it away. What I always try to avoid is providing the ability for one player to control the map. The weapons and items must be spread out evenly, everyone should be able to get an &quot;iron&quot; and/or armor without running to a great distance. 
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Seen any good movies lately?
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>Yup. Scourge Done Slick and Debbie Does Dallas.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Any closing comments?
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>Umm...nah...you won't print that anyway.</body></html>
