<b>Introduction:</b>

This tutorial will help you to setup QERadiant that was <br>installed with Kingpin.<br><br>

<b>Step 1:</b><br><br>

If you have Kingpin installed to its default directory (c:\program files\Kingpin):
With it installed to it's default directory, only the preferences should be modified, and not the project file which points everything to its correct places. First, startup QERadiant, it should ask you for the project file, locate kingpin.qe4 in Kingpin/KPRadiant then click 'open'.<br><br>

If you have Kingpin installed to a custom directory or on a different hard drive letter:
With it installed to a foreign directory, you will need to change the Kingpin project settings and the QERadiant preferences. First, startup QERadiant, it should ask you for the project file, locate kingpin.qe4 in Kingpin/KPRadiant then click 'open'. This is the file we must modify, but to make it easy, we will do it within QERadiant. Go to the 'File' menu then click the 'Project Settings' submenu. Everything should be pointing to the default directories (c:\program files\kingpin...). Change the paths so they match the location you installed Kingpin to.<br><br>

<b>Step 2:</b><br><br>

Go to the 'Edit' menu then click the 'Preferences' submenu. This will load up the common settings for QERadiant. Though some fields are not filled in, they are not required or needed.<br><br>

<b>Step 3 (optional):</b><br><br>

Color Settings:<br><br>

When you have finished steps 1 and 2, you should by now have noticed the black grid on white background. It helps to change the colors to white grid on black background. We will use preset colors by going to the 'Misc' menu, 'Colors' submenu, then 'Themes', and finally click on 'Black and Green'.<br><br>

You will notice that it has made the minor grid disappear. This is because it's actually now black, so change it by going to the 'Misc' menu, 'Colors' submenu, then 'Grid Minor' to a dark gray color of your choice, I recommend the RGB to be 25,25,25.</body></html>
