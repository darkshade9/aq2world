<h1>
Special Entity Names
</h1>
<p>
As of Half-Life version 1.0.0.9, there are a few special names that can be given to entities, that will activate those entities in specific circumstances. They are: 
</p>
<blockquote>
game_playerdie
game_playerkill
game_playerjoin
game_playerspawn
game_playerleave 
</blockquote>
<p>
For example, an entity with a name (targetname) of game_playerdie will be triggered whenever a player dies (and will be triggered by that player).

<h3>Related Entities</h3>None<br />
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Notes:</span><br />
Info_target entities can be used as the beam start and end points.<br />
You can create moving beams by using func_trains as the targets, but they need an origin brush for the beam to aim at.</p>

<a href="../node/954#env_beam">Env_beam</a>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Notes:</span><br />
env_laser differs from env_beam in that instead of the beam being created between two points, the env_laser entity acts as the start point, with the beam extending to a target.<br />
The simplest target to use is the info_node entity, but anything with a name can be used, including brush-based entities (such as func_wall).<br />
In this case, the brush needs to be grouped with an origin brush that defines the targetted point. An origin brush is any brush with the texture called &quot;origin&quot; on all faces.<br />
If you have multiple entities with the same name as the laser target, the beam will jump from point to point randomly, originating always from the  env_laser's location.</p>

Once the player has had a particular sound style applied, it stays with the player until it is changed by another env_sound. The setting can be returned to normal by forcing the player to pass through an env_sound with a Room Type of 0 (Normal).<br />
Typically these entities are placed above doorways and set the sound for the room. As the player passes into the room, the &quot;Room Type&quot; is initiated, it effects footsteps, and anything else that makes a sound in that room. Another env_sound at the exit of the same type and setting will cancel the effect.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Name</span> - Giving the env_sprite a name will allow it to be triggered on and off.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Render FX</span> -  The options are as follows: </p>
<pre>
0 = Normal
1 = Slow Pulse
2 = Fast Pulse
3 = Slow Wide Pulse
4 = Fast Wide Pulse
5 = Slow Fade Away
6 = Fast Fade Away
7 = Slow Become Solid

4 = Solid
5 = Additive
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">FX Amount</span> - The value of the Render Mode, between 0 and 255. <br />
'Solid' mode simply needs a non zero value to work, while in other modes translucency is controlled by this value.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">FX Color</span> - An RGB value that controls the colour of the object  rendering. Only Color and Glow Render Modes use the Render Color property, but other entities also use it under different SmartEdit names.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Pitch Roll Yaw</span> - Sets the pitch (up / down), yaw (left / right) and roll (bank) respectively. The compass in WorldCraft / Hammer corresponds to Yaw. The settings are not always (or not all) used.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Framerate</span> - For animated sprites, controls the framerate.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Sprite Name</span> - The path and name of the sprite as found in the PAK (default is <code>sprites/glow01.spr</code>).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Scale</span> - Sets the scale. Default is 1:1. If you leave this setting blank, the sprite will be set at it's optimum initial scale. Sometimes this is NOT 1:1. Entering a value of <span style="color: #ff0000">1</span> here may increase the size of a standard sprite.</p>
<h3>Flags</h3>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #ff0000">(1) Start On</span> - Entity will start on (or active). This usually only has effect if the entity is given a name (most entities that aren't given names start on anyway), or has its Toggle flag set on.<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000">(2) Play Once</span> - With animated sprites, makes the sprite play through its frames only once before it needs to be re-triggered to work.</blockquote>

<h1><a name="func_breakable">func_breakable</a></h1> - by G.A.R.D.
<p>This entity allows you to create a breakable brush, and is a useful affect for breaking glass, accidents and explosions.</p>
<h3>Properties</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Name</span> - A unique target name allows for a trigger, else for the brush to break it will have be damaged (shot, chainsawed ... etc). Set the Name if you want a trigger for an event.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Target</span> - Often when a brush breaks you will want to activate sound, another trigger ... etc. Target on break will activate that feature.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Material Type</span> - This defines the material type, where:</p>
<pre>0 - Glass
1 - Wood
2 - Metal
3 - Flesh
4 - Cinder Block
5 - Ceiling Tile
6 - Computer
7 - Unbreakable Glass
8 - Rocks</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Strength</span> - Sets the amount of damage a brush will sustain before breaking (unless a Name is set and trigger is used). Note that it is logical to make stronger materials harder. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/tovanen/" target="_blank">Tovanen</a> once suggested a value of 50 for wood, less for glass more for metal.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Delay (before breaking)</span> - Sets the delay between the breaking of the brush and by default flag properties (see below). Very useful for traps!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Gib Model</span> - Spawned the gibmodel when the brush is broken.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Spawn object</span> - Sets an item to be spawned when the brush is broken, options are:</p>
<pre>0 - Nothing
1 - Battery
2 - Healthkit
3 - 9mm Handgun
4 - 9mm Clip
5 - Machine Gun
6 - Machine Gun Clip
7 - Machine Gun Grenades
8 - Shotgun
9 - Shotgun Shells
10 - Crossbow
11 - Crossbow Bolts
12 - 357
13 - 357 clip
14 - RPG
15 - RPG Clip
16 - Gauss clip
17 - Hand grenade
18 - Tripmine
19 - Satchel Charge
20 - Snark
21 - Hornet Gun</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Explosion Magnitude</span> - This sets the size of the explosion that will result from breaking the brush. A value of Zero will result in no explosion. Breaking glass shouldn't have a explosion magnitude! </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Render Properties</span> - Sets the control the visual behavior of the object, See Render Properties Tutorial (still to be written!)</p>
<h3>Flags</h3> - Set the entity event to break on
<blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000">(1) Only Trigger</span> - Trigger is activated<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000">(2) Touch</span> - Player touches<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000">(4) Pressure</span> - When any object touches<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000">(256) Crowbar</span> - When hit with a crowbar</blockquote>

<h1><a name="func_button">func_button</a></h1> - by G.A.R.D. 
<p>This entity allows you to create a button, such as a elevator button ... any button in the game. This function  is typically used to trigger an event when it is touched or &quot;used&quot; by a player.  Once activated a Func_button will move in the direction set by an angle, for  a distance equal to its own length. Which gives the affect of a button being  pushed!</p>
<h3>Properties</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Name</span> - If a name, or target name, is assigned to a func_button entity, it can be activated by any trigger_ function. Name defines a unique identity to any func_button.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Render Properties</span>  - Sets the control the visual behavior of the object, See Render Properties Tutorial (still to be written!)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Speed</span> - This defines the rate a func_button will move from the inactivated to activate position.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Targeted object</span> - Sets the event that will be activated when a button is Flagged (see flags below)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Health</span> - If a non zero value is set here the func_button has to be shot/damaged rather than touched or used (flags are negated). When the button health reaches zero the target object will be activated.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Master</span> - Multisource master option (tutorial to be written ... sorry)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Wait</span> - Defines the time between switching between on and off. This is useful if you have a scripted sequence running, and don't wont the sequence to be restarted/ interrupted</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Delay</span> - Defines the delay between when the func_button is touched or used and the target object is activated.</p>
<h3>Flags</h3> - There are a four button flags behaviors, these are:
<blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000">(1) Don't move</span> - When enabled, the button will jump from inactive to activated without moving, 
<span style="color: #ff0000">(32) Toggle</span> - When enabled, the button moves in and out. The user has to press again to switch been active and inactive. The targeted object is  activated everytime the button is toggled. <br />
<span style="color: #ff0000">(64) Sparks</span> - When enabled sparks are generated when the button is inactive. <br />
<span style="color: #ff0000">(256) Touch</span> - When enabled, the button is activated by a  players touch, and does not require the "<span style="font-style: italic">use</span>" key. </blockquote>

<h3>RUST Forum Discusions</h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000">Mazemaster</span>: &nbsp;Suggested this great idea for a trap &quot;<span style="font-style: italic">make the wall a func_button with health 1 and with the &quot;do not move&quot; flag checked. Have that button target a multimanager, and have that multimanager trigger the gas and the turrets to come on.</span>"</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #ff0000">RD</span> </span>(Previous known as Realdespair): &nbsp;Suggested this cool affects idea using a func_button, &quot;<span style="font-style: italic">Make tracer fire in the sky (func_button with lightemitting texture RED, speed 3500, rendermode additive and a thin long shape) that just flies over the skyline around the map, like i did in lan_iban, i KNOW people will be digging that!</span>&quot;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Notes</span><br />
For this entity to actually look like it's moving, you need to use a texture with 'scroll' in its name like <code>scrollwater1</code>.
Set the texture's angle to the direction of the conveyor's movement (the texture will only scroll in its direction, not the conveyor's (so you can't make it move sideways unless the texture is rendered sideways).</p>

The func_door_rotating requires an origin brush as part of its entity. This gives it the axis to rotate on. The axis defaults to 'Z' if neither of the axis flags is enabled. There are two ways to reverse the direction of rotation: Check the relevent flag, or make the Distance property a negative value. If One Way is not enabled, the door will open away from the player.</p>

The simplest way to create a ladder is to construct the visible bit first, with the ladder texture you want, then copy the brush, drag it forward, and turn the front brush into a func_ladder. The Brush with the ladder texture should be a func_wall, with Render mode set to 'Solid' and FX Amount set to '255'. This will make the 'blue' parts of the texture disappear in game.   This entity can also simulate ropes (although the sound isn't quite right).</p>

To solve this make a seperate room that is lit the way you want, select the coordinates you want the object to move to 'after it is initially lit' in your special room, and enter them under this property. As the game begins, the object will be lit in your special room, and then move to these coordinates. Check your grid alignment using the 2D windows.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Notes:</span></p>
<p> Often used to create fans.  An origin brush needs to be part of the entity to specify its axis of rotation. If you use a WAV file to produce your sound, the 'Fan Sounds' will not work. </p>
<p>After a day trying to get a couple of fans to work, I thought I would share some info:<br />
If you are running your maps in OpenGL mode, you might find that the Fan Sounds and WAV name's don't work as advertised... Not sure of the reason, and I did a lot of testing and retesting and here is the result:<br />
For Fans that are always on, rather than piss around with these settings, just and an <a href="../node/959#ambient_generic">Ambient_generic</a> that has no name, but does have the sound you want the fan to make. Place it near the fan and it will sound Ok. For fans that spin up and down, you can 'Name' the ambient_generic and set it's Dynamic Preset to Fade in or Oscillate spin up/spin down. Just make sure the 'Name of the ambient_generic is the same 'Name' as the fan.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Disclaimer</span>: there is a good chance that this doesn't work for me cause I have a crap system. However, the idea of 'Blind' ambient_generics has other uses..... If something isn't making the noise you think it should such as the Monster_loader, just add a couple of blind generics with the right .wav files.</p>

It is important that the last path_track should not have a Next Stop Target. For this path_track to function correctly, set the property Fire on Dead End to the Name of the func_trackautochange. An origin brush needs to be part of the entity to specify its axis of rotation. The axis defaults to <span style="color: #ff0000">Z</span> if neither of the axis flags is enabled.</p>

When you create the brush model it must face west (90 degrees - to the left in the top view). When it spawns in the game it will automatically move to the first path_track and orientate itself to face the second path_track.   func_traincontrol entities allow the player to control the train. They are not part of the func_tracktrain and their placement only determines the area of use. They will automatically stay in that area relative to the train as it moves. An origin brush needs to be part of the entity to specify its axes. This is one of the few entities that can have 'clip' brushes as part of itself, which prevent player movement (i.e. to stop the player falling off the sides).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Notes:</span><br />
After spawning, the func_train moves instantly to its First Stop Target path_corner. So the entity can be created in another area (and therefore lighting can be controlled), but it will always appear in the right place to the player. When making moving targets for things like env_laser, set Render Mode to Texture and Render Amount to 0, and enable the Not Solid flag. No origin brush is required - the func_train aligns itself so that its centre is right over the centre of its path_corners.</p>

Concept seems similar to func_illusionary, but illusionary is 'not solid' (with optional invisibility... which makes it effectively the same), while this becomes 'not there'.

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Notes</span><br />
You can set the default wave height in the worldspawn properties (Map -> Map Properties) and this will effect all func_water entities in the map, but if you want less wave height for a particular entity, use the Wave Height property. Some of the func_door-derived properties don't work with func_water. To get the water to look like it's flowing, use a water texture name that starts with <span style="color: #ff0000">scroll</span>, (ie: SCROLLWATER1) and place it on a func_conveyor. The direction the "water" will flow is decided by the texture angle settings and not the conveyor direction.</p>

<a href="../node/954#env_message">Env_message</a><br />
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Notes</span>:<br />
  You are limited to a maximum message length of 127 characters.<br />
  Line breaks can be added with the newline code  <code><span style="font-weight: bold">\n</span></code><br /> . e.g. <code><span style="font-weight: bold">Line one\nLine two</span></code><br />
  X, Y, effect, color, color2, fadein, fadeout and fxtime are the same as those found in titles.txt.<br /><br />
  The easiest way to get a text based message at the start of your level, like the Black Mesa one from HL, is to add a trigger_auto to the level and set it's target to the name of your game_text. You might have to add a delay to the trigger, depending on wether you fade the screen in or not, but either way when the game starts your text will be displayed.</p>

<p>Info_nodes are essential for monsters who need to move under AI control. The engine draws a 'node graph' based on the positions of info_nodes in a map, and monsters can then find the quickest route from point A to point B via the nodes..</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Notes</span>:<br />
To check your info_node placement, compile the map and run it. From the console type <span style="color: #ff0000">impulse 197</span> and you should now see a glowing path of node tracks. This will show up any weak points in your placement and areas that may need more nodes.<br />
General rule of thumb for info_node placement is to use lot's and keep them 24 to 48 units away from any brush.<br />
Place them in the middle of hallways, rather than at the edges.<br />
Info_nodes can also be used to help monsters perform scripted_sequences.<br />
To help monsters navigate to and from scripted_sequences, use info nodes. IE: If you want Barney to go through a door, place an info_node in the center of the doorway and then a trail of info_node's from Barney to the scripted_sequence.<br />
There is a hard limit of 128 info_node's per map.<br />
Monster_human_assasins require MORE info_nodes than other monsters.</p>

<h1><a name="aiscripted_sequence">aiscripted_sequence</a></h1>
<p>This entity is similar to the normal scripted_sequence, except that it completly overrides the monster AI. Regardless of what you do to the monster, it will follow this sequence.</p>
<h3>Properties</h3><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Name</span> - Trigger to activate.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Target</span>- This event will be triggered when the script is complete.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Delay before trigger</span> - The delay before Target and KillTarget are activated, after completing sequence.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">KillTarget</span> - When the script is complete, this event will be removed from the game.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Pitch Yaw Roll</span> Sets the pitch (up / down), yaw (left / right) and roll (bank) respectively. The compass in WorldCraft / Hammer corresponds to Yaw. The settings are not always (or not all) used.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Target Monster</span> - The name of the monster that this script affects (see notes).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Action Animation</span> - This is the animation that will be performed by the targeted monster.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Search Radius</span> - The script will look for a valid monster in this radius. Set this to 0 if you want the script to be triggerable only.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Repeat Rate ms</span> - The above search will be performed with intervals of this length.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Move to Position</span> - How the monster moves:</p>
<code>
0 = No - Monster will perform the sequence wherever it is.
1 = Walk
- walks to the location of the aiscripted_sequence, then performs its animation.
2 = Run - as above, but runs.
4 = Instantaneous - warps to spot.
5 = No-turn to face

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Notes:</span><br />From WorldCraft/Hammer Helpfile: &quot;To play a wav through the streaming code (for very large, one-shot wavs) use <code> * </code> in front of the name. For instance, <code> ambienc/*speak2.wav </code> would stream speak2.wav. Streaming sounds are loaded in segments from the disk, played, and flushed from memory.&quot;<br />
&quot;To play any sentence from sentences.txt, replace the <code>path/filename.wav</code> with<code> ! </code>  followed by the sentence name. For instance,<code> !NA1 </code> plays the sentence named <span style="font-weight: bold">NA1</span> .&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;All the keyvalues from volstart to cspinup are various pitch, volume, and low frequency pitch oscillation settings that are overridden by the dynamic preset setting. In general, don't use these. The incremental spin-up count may be used as follows: each time the ambient is triggered, its pitch will rise from &quot;start pitch&quot; to &quot;pitch&quot; by this many increments. So, a setting of &quot;3&quot; means that the pitch of the ambient will rise from &quot;start pitch&quot; to &quot;pitch&quot; in three presses (ie: three triggers).&quot;</p>

You will also need to use seperate light_environment entities for each piece of sky.</p>

<h1><a name="light_spot">light_spot</a></h1>
<p>The light_spot entity allows you to create direct beams of light.</p>
<h3>Properties</h3><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Name</span> - Can be triggered to toggle on and off.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Target</span> - This lets you aim the light at an info_target entity rather than manually specifying the angles.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Pitch Yaw Roll</span> - Sets the pitch (up / down), yaw (left / right) and roll (bank) respectively. The compass in WorldCraft / Hammer corresponds to Yaw. The settings are not always (or not all) used.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">ZHLT Falloff</span> - See ZHLTReference for more information.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"> Inner Radius</span> - The angle of the cone formed around the directional axis. The area inside this cone will contain the brightest light.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"> Outer Radius</span> - As above, although the area inside this cone will fade increasingly towards the outer edges.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Pitch</span> - The pitch of the light (-90 is straight down, 90 is straight up).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Brighness</span> - The first three 3-digit number are the colour (RGB). The Fourth number is the brightness/luminesence.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Is Sky</span> - Values:</p>
<pre>0 =No
1 =Yes.</pre>
If Yes, the spot_light will affect the sky brushes, rather than project any light itself.
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Apperance</span> - Light appearance. Values:</p>
<pre>0 = normal
1 = flicker A
2 = slow strong pulse
3 = candle A

If he needs a Sci to open a door for instance, but think outside the square... This can also be used if Gordon follows a path to nowhere. Just remember to use a trigger_autosave before the event.</p>

Your tiny progeny immediately  displays the aggressive nature that is so ingrained in your own psyche. You  are prone to having microwave accidents.&quot;<br /> -SlayerA</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Notes:</span><br />To get the most out of your assassin's you need to use a lot of info_nodes.

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Notes:</span><br />Careful placement of the path_corners ensures a smooth looking flight path. The path_corners will need to be tweaked to adjust pitch, roll and speed.<br /> This entity needs a lot of room to fly in. It also drops monster_grunt_repel based on the number of grunt_repels added initially.<br /> The resupply occurs when the grunt's are killed, based on where they were initially placed in the map.<br /> Make sure you have a path_corner over the grunts!! as this is where the Osprey will head to drop new ones when they die. </p>

The Plantlight will not emit light, but these settings make it look as though it does.</p>
