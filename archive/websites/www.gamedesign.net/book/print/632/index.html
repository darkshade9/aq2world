<b>The Idea:</b><br>
Take a screenshot of a level you build from scratch. The idea is to show us your mapping and editing brilliance.<p>
<b>Game Type:</b><br>
You can take a screenshot from any game that is covered at RUST.<P>
<b>Guidelines:</b>
<ul>
<li>Only one screenshot of your map/area is needed.</li>
<li>Posted Screenshots shouldn't be bigger than 320*240.</li>
<li>Must have the original editor and compiled map file.</li>
<li>Post your entry <a href="http://forums.gamedesign.net/viewforum.php?f=80">HERE </a>.</li>
<li>Date the competition closes is the 15th October 04.</li>
</ul>
<b>Judging:</b><br>
Points will be awarded based on the "WOW" factor. 
<ul>
<li>Do I want to play this map?</li>
<li>Does it excite me?</li>
<li>Is it visually brilliant?</li>
</ul>
Remember to have the .map file at the ready, as the winner will be required to produce it.<p>
