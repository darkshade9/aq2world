When the map loads, the barnacle will extend it's 'tongue' until it hits another brush (floor, table etc,).  This takes a while so It isn't a good idea to place barnacles at the entrance of a map. Leave them sufficient time to extend.<br><br>

Garg's are great fun. I am probably wrong, but I only remember 2 in Half-Life. One was in the underground carpark and the other was in a tunnel somewhere. The best thing about this is that they were not overdone. <i>Hint..Hint</i><br><br>

The most common occurence of these guy's is included in the monster_osprey. But they are equally good value dropping from ceilings and cliffs. Place the monster entity at the point you want them to drop from, Their rope does not extend past their start point as the animation starts, so careful placement is necessary so that they don't look 'odd'.<br><br>

<b>Notes:</b><br>
As I mentioned in the intro, these guy's work best in packs. Originally intended to be "friendly" to the player, the Beta testing changed all that. Seems that the testers blew these little critters away as soon as they saw them. So in true Valve style, they modified the original dog like creature and made it nasty.<br><br>

To get the most out of your assassin's you need to use a lot of info_nodes. You will get the best "play" out of your assassin's if you use about three times as many nodes as you would with a normal monster. <BR>

Careful placement of the path_corners ensures a smooth looking flight path. The path_corners will need to be tweaked to adjust pitch, roll and speed.<br> This entity needs a lot of room to fly in. It also drops monster_grunt_repel based on the number of grunt_repels added initially.<br> The resupply occurs when the grunt's are killed, based on where they were initially placed in the map.<br> Make sure you have a path_corner over the grunts!! as this is where the Osprey will head to drop new ones when they die. <br><br>
