First, we need to choose a blueprint. There are a few sites where you can get them for free.<br>
<br>
Onno van Braam:<br>
<a href=http://www.onnovanbraam.com><b>http://www.onnovanbraam.com</b></a><br>
<br>
Suurland:<br>
<a href=http://www.suurland.com><b>http://www.suurland.com</b></a><br>
<br>
Pick one you like, I chose this f360 from onno van(atm this picture is down, it will be up asap) braam. <a href=><b>ferrari 360</b></a>.<br>
<br>
Next where going to need <b>irfanview</b> to cut the blueprint in 4 pieces.<br>
You can get it here:<br>
<b><a href=http://www.irfanview.com/>irfanview</a><br></b>
<br>
Save the blueprint of your choice to your computer and open it up in Irfanview.<br>
<br>
You can draw a box around the blueprint, make sure it fits exactly around one view of the car, ex.: the top of the car <b>ONLY</b>.<br>
After you have drawn a box around one of the sides of the car, go to:<br>
<i>Edit-Crop selection</i><br>
<img src="content/modeling/imagecutting/example1.jpg"><br>
<br>
Now you should ony have the top-view of the car.<br>
We need the width and height of the image. To do this go to:<br>
<i>Image-Resize Resample</i><br>
<br>
This window should pop-up:<br>
<img src="content/modeling/imagecutting/example2.jpg" ><br>
<br>
If you have done everything right there should be 2 boxes with width and height. Remember those numbers and save them in the name of the jpg/bmp.<br>
In my case that would be:<br>
f360_top_433x213.jpg<br>
<br>
Repeat the steps with all the views and save them with the name you want.<br>
<br>
You can close <b>Irfanview</b> now and open up <b>milkshape</b><br>
<br>
In <b>Milkshape</b> put your mouse in one of the viewports. Do a right-mouse click and move down to:<br>
<i>Choose background image</i><br>
<br>
Now you can pick your refrence image of the car.<br>
Remember to check for the right image. You can put in the width and height of the images in the box that pops up.<br>
