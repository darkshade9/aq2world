<b>NAME:</b> Stephen J. Gard<br>

<b>BIOGRAPHY</b><br>

<b><i>Description:</i></b><br> 
I'm not making a game, I want to make the best damn book ever. That is right a book. I'm still working on the design, but have put that aside for six months to finish my PhD and get this web site restarted.<br><br>

I got hooked on editing when I discovered that QuArK editors and have mainly edit for Quake III Arena (Wolv helped me first). My images are more about the look I want, and not so much the game play. Although the idea of generating a movie in Game (Machinema) intrigues me a lot, and when I have the time (when this site is fixed), I will spend more time playing around with editors that will let me make a short film. That is ofcourse when I have upgraded the book, and submitted it for publication.<br><br>

In the real world, Im a Geologist GIS expert who refines computer models to better target mineral deposits, such as gold. So far I haven't found a <i>single</i> gold deposit yet, but who knows what will happen tomorrow. I enjoy this research because it is like looking for buried treasure, hidden by nature.<br><br>
