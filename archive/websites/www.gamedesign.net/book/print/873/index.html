<BR>
<H2><U><A NAME="fixes">FIXES</A></U></H2>
- Fixed a problem with Burning Oil that caused the effect to not be created when buildings were attacked directly.
<BR>
- Fixed a problem that caused some instant spells cast after a targeted spell to execute before the targeted spell.
<BR>
- Fixed problems with the Melee AI when it attempted to use certain instant spells.
<BR>
- Fixed a problem with Morphing units re-executing commands that were interrupted by the morph timer expiring.
<BR>
- Fixed an exploit that would allow players to track enemy units under the fog of war with queued move commands.
<BR>
- Fixed a problem with units following enemy units and never proceeding to the next order when they moved underneath the fog.
<BR>
- Fixed a problem with spells that can target a point or unit (like Shockwave) failing when the selected target dies. If the selected target runs under the fog or teleports, the spell is intended to fail
<BR>
- Fixed a problem with Envenomed Spears wearing off too early if the affected unit was also affected by Slow Poison or the Orb of Venom.
<BR>
- Fixed the invisibility transition time for levels 2 and 3 of Wind Walk.
<BR>
- Fixed the orb air attack speeds for the Blood Mage, Pit Lord, and Fire Lord.
<BR>
- Fixed the armor upgrade values for Human, Orc, and Undead shops.
<BR>
- Fixed a problem preventing Phased Faerie Dragons from teleporting.
<BR>
- Fixed an issue with Faerie Dragons that could cause them to become unresponsive to most commands if you Phase Shifted just as the unit was attacking something.
<BR>
- Fixed Doom so that the spell now has a maximum creep level.
<BR>
- Fixed an issue that caused Crypt Fiends to deactivate Web when they unburrowed.
<BR>
- Fixed a problem with Cleaving Attack that would prevent it from working when Orbs were equipped.
<BR>
- Fixed an issue with Cleaving Attack that would cause Thorns Aura to reflect damage on targets that took splash damage.
<BR>
- Fixed an issue that could cause the Orb of Annihilation's splash damage to ignore armor.
<BR>
- Fixed a problem that could cause Metamorphosis to cancel the effects of a Staff of Teleportation.
<BR>
- Fixed Devour such that devoured units now give experience to the owner of the Kodo Beast if it gets polymorphed/hexed and instantly digests the unit.
<BR>
- Fixed rally points such that friendly units will no longer cancel rally orders to Heroes that teleport, Blink, or Mirror Image.
<BR>
- Fixed illusions so they now get correct damage, armor, life, and mana bonuses consistent with the original units.
<BR>
- Fixed an issue with morphed units that could cause them to cost food when revived by Animated Dead if they had died in their morphed form.
<BR>
- Fixed the Storm Pandaren (from the Pandaren Brewmaster's ultimate) so it now correctly displays Wind Walk's backstab damage.
<BR>
- Fixed a problem with Flame Strike that wouldn't allow Blood Mages to become invisible after they finished channeling the spell.  Prior to this fix, the Blood Mage would become visible for as long as damage was taking place, despite the fact that he was no longer casting the spell.
<BR>
- Fixed upgrading buildings such that they now receive the correct hit point bonus from the Masonry upgrade.
<BR>
- Fixed a problem that could cause manually cast arrow abilities to occasionally fail.
<BR>
- Fixed racial shops so they no longer block line of sight.
<BR>
- Fixed multiple units' casting the same spell so they now distribute the load more efficiently.
<BR>
- Fixed creeps so that missile spells no longer wake them when launched. 
Instead, the creeps now wake when a spell hits.
<BR>
- Fixed channeling units so they will auto-queue orders issued to the entire selection except for Stop and Hide.  Orders issued to the selected subgroup will break channeling (so you can teleport out of the area while channeling).
<BR>
- Fixed units in the middle of a non-channeling spell such that they will now auto-queue all orders until the spell is complete.
<BR>
- Fixed Hero icons so their order is now consistent throughout the game.
<BR>
- Fixed replay speeds so they can once again be changed while the replay is paused.
