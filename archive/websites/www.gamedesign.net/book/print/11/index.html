 <p>This is an attempt to answer some of the more common errors that occur in Quake 2. 
	This is not meant to be a comprehensive list! There may be plenty of errors that 
	are not covered - this is merely an attempt to document the causes/solutions of 
	the more frequent ones.  Additionally, you may want to visit the 
	<a href="">Q2 Errors Tutorial</a> 
	here at Rust.</p>

<ul type="square">
	<li><b>Bounds out of range</b> <!-- inc start img --> <a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>This error may be caused by one of two conditions. The obvious one is a brush 
		that has one or more vertices outside the +/- 4096 limits. The not-so-obvious 
		one is a brush that is missing a plane (which might happen if you manually 
		edit your .map file, and also is a possible result of brush subtraction operations).
		An oft-misunderstood fact is how brushes are constructed for the Q2 engine... 
		the x,y,z triplets in your .map file are NOT necessarily brush vertices - they 
		are simply points that define the plane. Brushes are constructed by starting 
		with an infinite solid and then removing everything on one side of the planes 
		that define the brush. This, coincidentally, is why you cannot have a concave 
		brush (think about it). In the case of a cube with the top face missing, the 
		brush will be infinitely tall (infinity in Q2 being 8192, of course)... which 
		leads to the bounds out of range error.</p>

	<li><b>Duplicate Plane</b> <a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>This error was likely caused by an edge manipulation where you pulled one edge 
		toward the center of a brush such that two faces now lie on the same plane - for 
		example turning a cube into a wedge.  It could also be the result of a brush 
		subtraction operation. </p>

	<li><b>FloatPlane: bad normal</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>Collinear points are usually to blame for this error. In many cases, 2 points are 
		identical. This error is sometimes caused by faulty edge manipulation: pulling one 
		edge of a face until it lines up with another edge of the same face, for example.</p>

	<li><b>Microbrush</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>Microbrushes have a volume less than a 1x1x1 unit cube. Microbrushes are 
		frequently generated by complex brush subtraction operations, but might also be 
		generated by editors with floating-point conversion problems. In the first case, you 
		will generally be better off building complex objects manually rather than using 
		brush subtraction. In the second case, you can prevent this error by insuring that 
		brush vertices lie on grid units. Microbrushes are frequently drawn incorrectly in 
		the game, so you will likely want to find and delete this brush.</p>

	<li><b>Mirrored Plane</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>This error indicates that a brush has no thickness in one or more directions, i.e. 
		opposing faces of the brush lie on the same plane. This error may be generated by 
		building a brush less than 1 unit thick - one face's coordinate gets rounded up, 
		and the opposite face's coordinate gets rounded down. This situation can be 
		avoided by insuring that a brush's vertices lie on grid units.</p>

	<li><b>Mixed Face Contents</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>Content properties must be identical for all faces of a brush. You <b>can</b>, 
		however, have different surface properties.</p>

	<li><b>No visible sides on brush</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>This error indicates that the bounding box coordinates for the brush are 
		completely outside the +/-4096 limits in one or more directions. Note that 
		this error may be generated by a faulty bounding box being calculated by 
		qbsp3. In this case, one or more faces of the brush are fouled up to the 
		extent that you will probably be better off deleting the brush and 
		re-creating it.</p>

	<li><b>Origin brushes not allowed in world</b> <!-- inc end img --><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>This error is frequently caused by attempting (but failing) to add an 
		origin brush to a func_door_rotating or func_rotating. Methods for grouping 
		origin brushes with entities differ with the various editors. Consult your 
		editor's documentation.</p>

	<li><b>Plane with no normal</b> 
	 <P>This error generally indicates that the points defining a plane are 
		collinear or that 2 points are identical. Find and delete this 
		brush.</P>

<hr color=black noshade width=75%>
<h3>QVIS Errors</h3>

<ul type="square">
	<li><b>Leafportals saw into leaf</b>
	 <P>It's not so simple as finding the single offending "leafportal" brush. As 
		your map increases in size or simply changes brushes that generate no errors 
		can become causes of leafportal errors. Worse is that subsequent compiles of 
		the unchanged map may produce more or fewer leafportal errors, and this lack 
		of consistency makes finding the error even more maddening.<br>
		<br>
		Often the worst offenders are brushes with many faces sharing the same vertex (like a 
		spike or a skewed brush with a mitered corner).<br>
		<br>
		Advice often given is to "simplify". While this is useful advice up to a point I suppose, tracking 
		down specific troublesome brushes as they relate to their environment (your 
		map) is the real key (good luck). If you do find them, I've recently 
		discovered that making them and the brushes they adjoin detail brushes may 
		correct the problem, as will making them brush entities like func_walls. 
		(Since this is a vis error, this makes sense when you think about 
		it).</p>

		QVIS Errors</a> tutorial here at Rust.</p>
</ul>

<hr color=black noshade width=75%>
<h3>QRAD Errors</h3>

<ul type="square">
	<li><b>face with too many light styles (x y z)</b>
	 <p>There are too many different dynamic light styles, such as flashing 
		lights, that hit a single face of a brush. The limit is 4 light styles 
		that can hit a face. The best solution is to reduce the number of 
		lights in the area or spread them out further. The coordinates tell you 
		which brush face has caused the problem, which tells you indirectly where 
		the problem lights are. Note that this error <b>may</b> be 
		associated with a target_lightramp.</p>

</ul>

<hr color=black noshade width=75%>
<h3>Startup and Runtime Errors</h3>

<ul type="square">
	<li><b>Missing texture</b> <!-- inc start end img --><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>A custom texture was used and it isn't in the gamedir/textures dir. 
		Remember in q2 textures are not included in .bsp files, if you use custom 
		textures, include the .wals in your zip with install instructions, or better 
		yet, distribute as a .pak with a maps/mymap.bsp and a 
		textures/mytexture.wal. </p>
		
	<li><b>CDAudio: Invalid track 1 specified</b>
	 <p>The CD track ("sounds" key in worldspawn entity) must be 2 through 11 to 
		match the audio tracks on the Q2 CD-ROM. (Track 1 is the Quake 2 
		installation files.) </p>

	<li><b>No music plays in the map</b>
	 <P>Add the "sounds" key in the worldspawn entity and specify a CD track 
		number, 2 through 11.</P>

	<li><b>No spawn function for xxxx</b>
	 <p>Typically caused by not specifying the proper +set game setting. 
		The entity can't appear properly since the proper entity information isn't 
		available with the default Quake 2 game. Run the game with the proper 
		+set game XXXX parameter.</p>

    <li><b>areaportals&gt;=numareaportals (when opening a door; bombs to console)</b>
	 <p>Since areaportals affect vis, you must do a full bsp and some sort of vis 
		after changing them, NOT just a bsp -onlyents. Additionally, can be caused 
		by a bad areaportal - if you get an areaportal message during compilation, 
		you may see this error in the game.</p>

    <li><b>Bad surface extents</b>
     <p>This error might occur on maps compiled with the -chop option for qbsp3, 
		with chop values greater than the default 240. This error is more likely to 
		occur while using software rendering than GL. This error is seen at the 
		console when attempting to load the map. The map crashes when it occurs. If 
		you have <b>not</b> used the -chop option with a chop value 
		greater than 240, try using -chop with values smaller than 240. When you 
		find a value that works, increase the value until the error occurs again, 
		then back off of that value slightly.</p>
		
	<li><b>Com_sprintf: overflow of X in 32 </b></b> <!-- inc start img --><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <p>The message field in the worldspawn entity (used as the title of your 
		map) contains too many characters. The maximum length of this field to 
		prevent this error is 22 characters. This error is generally harmless, but 
		note that worldspawn messages longer than 28 characters will not fit across 
		the width of the F1 Help computer.</p>

    <li><b>connected teleport path_corners</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <p>You have two or more sequential path_corners which both have the teleport 
		spawnflag set.</p>

    <li><b>couldn't find destination &lt;target&gt;</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <p>This error results from a missing, inhibited, or wrongly-named 
		misc_teleporter_dest.</p>

    <li><b>couldn't find spawn point</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>The map does not have an info_player_start (for Single Player mode), 
		info_player_deathmatch entity (for Deathmatch mode), or info_player_team1 
		and info_player_team2 (for CTF mode.)</p>

	<li><b>droptofloor: [item] startsolid at (x y z)</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>All Quake 2 models have an associated bounding box that cannot be 
		embedded in a world brush. For example, all weapon, ammo, item, and key 
		entities have a 32x32x32 bounding box centered at the origin of that entity, 
		so these items must be placed with their origin at least 16 units away from 
		the surface of any world brush.</p>
		
	<li><b>ED_Alloc: no free edicts</b> <!-- exemt img -->
     <p>There are too many entities or active objects (flying bullets, 
		explosions, debris, lasers, etc.) in your map.</p>
		
	<li><b>elevator used with no pathtarget by func_button at ( x y z )</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <p>Entities which target trigger_elevators (normally func_buttons) must also 
		use the pathtarget field to specify which path_corner the elevator is to 
		travel to when the elevator is triggered.</p>

    <li><b>&lt;entity&gt; without a target</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <P>Many entities (e.g. func_train) require a target to function 
		properly.</p>

    <li><b>Entity used itself</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>You have an entity which has the same value for its target and 
		targetname. If it is caused to trigger its target, it tries to trigger 
		itself. This error is seen on the screen during gameplay.</P>

    <li><b>ERROR: Index Overflow</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>There are too many unique models or too many unique sounds in your 
		map. You cannot have more than 256 unique models or 256 unique sounds 
		in a map. Every brush model (e.g. func_door, trigger_once) counts as a 
		unique model. For more information see <A 
		href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/eio.html">Error: Index Overflow (and 
		Other Horrible Nasty Problems) SOLVED</A>.</P>

    <li><b>[classname] at (x y z) has invalid spawnflags set</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>Self-explanatory. This error will not cause any runtime problems, 
		but may indicate that you meant to set a particular spawnflag but typed in a 
		wrong value instead.</P>

    <li><b>func_timer at ( x y z ) has random &gt;= wait</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <P>Self-explanatory. In this case the game will override the random value 
		and use "wait" - FRAMETIME (0.01 seconds).</P>

    <li><b>func_train without a target</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>Func_trains must target a path_corner</P>

    <li><b>func_wall START_ON without TOGGLE</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>This is a nag error - the game will force the TOGGLE spawnflag in this 
		case, and the func_wall will function properly.</P>

    <li><b>&lt;entity&gt; at ( x y z ) has invalid spawnflags set</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>Self-explanatory. If you consistently get this error, it is possible that 
		your editor's entity definition file(s) are fouled up.</P>

    <li><b>item &lt;item&gt; not found for trigger_key at ( x y z )</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>The trigger_key has an invalid item field. Though the item is normally a 
		key entity, you can also use ammo, weapons, and any item entity other than 
		health. You might, for example, take weapons away from a player by setting 
		the item field to a weapon entity.</P>

    <li><b>&lt;key&gt; is not a field </b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>Your map contains an invalid key-value pair. Either your editor has 
		incorrectly inserted an invalid key (that may be valid in another game) or 
		you have manually typed in an invalid key.</P>

    <li><b>PF_SetModel: NULL </b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>An entity that requires one or more brushes to function correctly does 
		not have an associated brush. The usual suspects in this case are trigger 
		brushes (trigger_once, trigger_multiple, etc.). Download <A 
		href="http://www.magnolia.net/~rascal/mapspy.zip">MapSpy</A> to help track 
		down the offending entity.</P>

    <li><b>G_PickTarget: target [name] not found</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>A point_combat entity may only be used once. You cannot have multiple 
		monsters combattarget the same point_combat.</P>

    <li><b>Map does not have an empty leaf</b> <!-- exemt img -->
     <P>This error is caused by a bug in Quake2, and usually occurs when all 
		leafs of a map contain clip brushes. This error is generally only produced 
		in small test maps with few leafs. You can avoid this error by moving clip 
		brushes around, or download a different version of <A 
		href="http://www.magnolia.net/~rascal/qbsp3.zip">qbsp3</A>, which 
		automatically generates an empty leaf if one is not found. This error is 
		seen on the console when loading the map, and the map crashes when it 
		occurs.</P>

    <li><b>&lt;monster&gt; at ( x y z ) has bad item &lt;item&gt;</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>Monsters (including turret_drivers) can drop ammo, weapons, keys, and any 
		item entity other than health.</P>

    <li><b>&lt;monster&gt; ( x y z ) has a bad combattarget &lt;combattarget&gt;: 
	&lt;classname&gt; at ( x y z ) </b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>Combattargets must be point_combat.</P>

    <li><b>&lt;monster&gt; at ( x y z ) has target with mixed types.</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>This error occurs if either 1) monster has a target that is NOT a 
		point_combat and also has a combattarget, or 2) monster has a target that IS 
		a point_combat AND a target that is NOT a point_combat.</P>

    <li><b>&lt;monster&gt; can't find target &lt;target&gt; at ( x y z )</b> <!-- inc end img --><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>The monster targets an entity that does not exist.</P>

    <li><b>Ran out of faces for bmodel</b>
     <P>A large func_water entity is filling an area with a very complex solid 
		surface. A solution is to break the func_water up into smaller entities, 
		start the func_water with the more complex brushes already breaking the 
		surface, or remove some of the more complex brushes in its 
		path.</P>

    <li><b>SZ_GetSpace: Overflow</b>
     <P>The game engine can see too many entities. If you have not already run 
		vis, try a -fast vis. This will usually fix the problem. If it does not, you 
		<B>may</B> be able to solve the problem with a full vis, but this may only 
		obscure a problem that might occur during play (rather than when the level 
		first loads). For example, a full vis may allow you to start the map, but 
		then you might get this error when firing rockets or grenades at a squad of 
		gunners. If a full vis does not solve the problem, you have several 
		choices:<BR>
		<BR>
		- Eliminate entities<BR>
		- Use func_areaportals in your doors<BR>
		- Add vis-blocking architecture, i.e. 90 degree bends in hallways, 
		  doughnut hallways, etc.<BR>
		<BR>
		<b>Special case:</b> You may 
		sometimes get this error message when tracking down leaks using LeakHunter, 
		even though your level contains very few entities. In this case, the 
		pointfile that contains leak information is too large - LeakHunter generates 
		a laser for each segment of the pointfile, and since all segments will be 
		visible to the engine, too many lasers cause this crash. You can eliminate 
		this problem by editing your pointfile with a text editor and deleting 
		points. The pointfile starts in the void and works its way into your map, 
		ending at an entity. You should be able to delete all points after, for 
		example, the 20th point and still have sufficient information in the 
		pointfile to find the leak. Note that LeakHunter will always spawn the 
		player at the last point in the pointfile, so you will not have a problem 
		finding the starting laser segment. Note that having very few entities in 
		your map (so the path from an entity to a leak is longer) usually generates 
		large pointfiles. As an alternative to deleting points in the pointfile, you 
		can temporarily add several light entities to your map and re-compile. This 
		should result in a much smaller pointfile that will not cause the 
		SZ_GetSpace Overflow error with LeakHunter.</P>

    <li><b>target_help with no message at ( x y z )</b> <!-- inc start img --><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>Self-explanatory. Target_help must have a message field (otherwise what's 
		the point?)</P>

    <li><b>target_lightramp has bad ramp (&lt;ramp&gt;)</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>The message field of target_lightramp must be 2 and only 2 characters, 
		and both characters must be lowercase letters. The first letter specifies 
		the starting lightlevel; 2nd letter specifies the ending lightlevel. a is 
		darkest; z is brightest. For example "az" would ramp from dark to bright and 
		"za" from bright to dark.</P>

    <li><b>target_lightramp target &lt;target&gt; (&lt;classname&gt; at ( x 
    y z )) is not a light. </b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>Target_lightramps may only target light entities. This prohibition 
		includes light_mine1 and light_mine2.</P>

    <li><b>teleporter without a target at ( x y z ) </b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>Misc_teleporter should target a misc_teleporter_dest. With no target, the 
		misc_teleporter will not appear in the game.</P>

    <li><b>train_find: target &lt;target&gt; not found </b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>There is no entity (should be a path_corner) whose targetname matches the 
		target field of the func_train.</P>

    <li><b>trigger_elevator at ( x y z ) target &lt;target&gt; is not a train. </b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>As implied, trigger_elevators must target a func_train.</P>

    <li><b>trigger_elevator at ( x y z ) unable to find target &lt;target&gt; </b> <!-- inc end img --><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>The target of the trigger_elevator (which should be a func_train) does 
		not exist.</P>

    <li><b>Quake 2 simply crashes without an error</b>
     <P>Major causes for this include:<br>
		- Worldcraft putting animated textures in UPPERCASE. Fix using 
		<A href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/">MapSpy</A>.
		<a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a><BR>
		- Lack of a Worldspawn entity.<BR>
		- A VERY low amount of space for a swapfile while loading a large map.<BR>
		- Spawning many entities simultaneously.</P>

			The angles in Q2 don't match what you're used to in real life. 0 - is to the
			right(East) looking from the top view. Then, it's 90 to the North, 180 to the West, and
			270 to the South. -1 is up, and -2 is down. Also, there is a bug with the trigger_push
			entity, you should use 1 instead of 0 if you want the player to be pushed Eastward.

			Attenuation = -1 works fine for non-looped sounds. Looped sounds are always attenuation
			= 3, regardless of what you enter for this value. If you want a looped sound to be heard
			across the entire map:<br>
			1) Find the duration of the sound using Sound Recorder or other audio program. If the .wav
			file is in one of the Q2 paks, you may have to extract it to your hard disk first. If you
			don't have a pak editor to do this, a good one is qped, available from
			www.planetquake.com/qped.<br>
			2) Add a func_timer to your level, with the &quot;start on&quot; spawnflag. The wait value
			of the func_timer should be set to the duration of the .wav file. Target your
			target_speaker with the func_timer. (David Hyde)

		<a name="4">
        <li><b>How do I use a sound I made in Quake 2 with the target_speaker entity?</b><br>

			First make sure your .wav file is mono rather than stereo. Create a custom directory
			for your custom sounds so that you don't get confused about what sounds came from who or
			where. All sounds must go somewhere below baseq2\sound, so create a subdirectory
			baseq2\sound\mysound, for example. In the .map, reference the sound including the relative
			path below baseq2\sound. For example, the noise field of your target speaker would be
			&quot;mysound/mywav.wav&quot;. Note the forward slash rather than a backslash. (David
			Hyde)

            You can use the Team attribute to accomplish this. In the Team attribute, put the same

            Once again, use the Team attribute for the two entities. Place the two items (for

            &quot;weaponspawn&quot;). Then, one of them will be spawned, after that item it taken, the

            Unfortunately, you can't turn the trigger_push on or off using the standard Q2 entity.

			Unlike Quake 1, which had no visible signs of teleporters, Quake 2 teleporters have a
			base and &quot;sparkles&quot; in the later releases of the Quake2 engine. There is a quick
			&quot;trick&quot; to get around this if you have a deep enough floor. You can simply
			move the entity down a few Quake units into the floor and both the base and the

            get a sky to appear at all? </b><br>

			Skies in Quake 2 are slightly different. They need to be defined using the Sky
			attribute in the Worldspawn entity. (And to keep all you Qoole users from asking, you
			modify the Worldspawn entity in Qoole by not having anything else selected and choosing
			the entity properties). The valid skies are unit1_ through unit9_ and space1. Then, any
			texture with a surface property of sky will use the sky defined. (See the tutorial page

            Unfortunately, you cannot make just one big brush with a 90 degree bend in it. It must
            be made of smaller separate brushes (you can later group them in you editor). This is
            because the Quake engine cannot handle concave brushes. You can check if a brush is
            concave in your head like this: Think of one of the vertices in the brush, and see if you
            can make an imaginary line to another one, where the line goes outside the brush.

        <li><b>Can I have moving lights in my Quake 2 level?</b><br>

            Not without coding or using a mod that supports it. The original Quake 2 engine doesn't
            allow the default light entities to move. The Quake 2 Mission Pack: The Reckoning,
            however, has a rotating_light entity.

        <li><b>How do I make the func_train entity rotate? </b><br>

            You can't. The func_train entity in Quake 2 can't rotate around an axis. Like the
            rotating light question however, it all depends on how an entity is coded. Hexen II, for
            example, has such an entity. So, you'll either have to do coding of your own entity to do
            this or find a mod that has one.

            The &quot;sparks&quot; themselves are actually the target_splash entity. However, as
            the entity name implies, this entity needs to be targeted in order to work. Typically, the
            target_splash entity is targeted by a func_timer entity, with the random property set. See

        <li><b>I've heard someone mention &quot;point entity&quot; and &quot;solid

            A point entity is an entity that doesn't require a user-defined model to work. For
            example, a monster is an example of a point entity since it has a pre-defined model
            associated with it. A solid entity, however, requires the editor to manually define a
            brush to be associated with the entity. For example, a door entity is an example of a
            solid entity. The editor has to define what brush (or brushes) make up the physical door.
            If a solid entity is not associated with a brush, a PF:SetModel = None error or something
            similar when the level is started.

            This occurs when the Origin brush hasn't been properly grouped with the rest of the
            brushes before making it a rotating door or object. Different editors may require their

            editor-specific boards for grouping information.

        <li><b>How do I create ladders? Are they some sort of entity type or something? </b><br>

            Ladders aren't a separate entity, rather they are created by applying the ladder
            surface property to ALL sides of a brush to create the ladder. See the Surface Properties
            tutorial on the tutorials page for more information.

        <li><b>What about currents...how are they created? </b><br>

            Like ladders, currents are created by applying the appropriate current surface property
            to liquid textures. See the Surface Properties tutorial on the tutorials page for more
            information.

            Textures can be 'flipped' by putting a -1 value in the X-axis Scale attribute for that
            texture surface. This is most useful for textures that have some sort of readable text.

            Create a func_wall entity on a brush.&nbsp; Then, on the side you want to see <strong>through</strong>,
            select the Skip surface property.

        <li><b>How do you make it so an animated texture moves when triggered like in the
            research lab where you hit a button and the display monitor texture starts moving?</b><br>

            That particular &quot;trick&quot; is done as follows: It's actually two separate
            func_walls at each monitor location. The func_wall that's initially seen has trigger
            spawn, toggle, start on, and animated spawnflags set. The other has trigger spawn and
            toggle spawnflags. Both func_walls have the same targetname. The button targets both
            func_walls, and their visibility flip-flops.

            It basically makes certain animated texture animated. Animated Fast makes it animate
            faster than normal. However, it should be noted that this does only work with certain
            textures, for example, e1u2/keydran1_1(&amp; 1_2). Other textures may not show any effect
            with those spawnflags.

	<ul type="square">
		<a name="37">
        <li><b>Every time I try to compile my map with the latest versions of qbsp3.exe or any
            of the other compilers, it crashes and I get some message saying that the program
            performed an illegal option or something to that effect. How do I fix this?</b><br>

            You don't have enough virtual memory for the compilers to finish (they're hogs, so you
            have to give them plenty of room!) Go to Control Panel, System, Performance, Virtual
            Memory. Turn off letting Win95 (or Win98) handle the swapfile and switch it to be located
            on the drive with the most free space. It's not unusual for the compilers to need 100Mb to
            500Mb of free space, depending on the size of the maps. <br>
            <br>
            Unfortunately, if you don't have that sort of room you've got 2 choices:<br>
            -delete some stuff (and run a disk defrag afterwards)<br>
            -get another hard drive.

        <li><b>After compiling my level, I notice that I can see &quot;through&quot; the sky
            into another room in my level. How can I keep this from happening?</b><br>

            First, make sure that you've done a full VIS which sometimes helps clear up this
            problem. Also, you can use a Hint brush between the player and the sky.
            However, sometimes these methods won't clear up the problem, so you have to always
            consider this when designing your maps. Plan ahead and if need be, use blocker walls
            and the like to help obstruct the view into these areas.

        <li><b>My level takes ### hours/days/weeks to compile. Am I doing something wrong? </b><br>

            This is a next-to-impossible question to answer. The fact is that how complex your
            level is determines how long it will compile. And this means how complex your level is to
            the Quake engine, not your perception of complex. If your level is taking longer than you
            think it should, you need to understand WHY it's taking so long. Things like texture
            lighting, large open spaces, etc. can all dramatically increase the time it takes to
            compile a level. See the Tutorials and Style pages here at Rust for a better idea of how
            to create good levels.

            level disappear at certain angles...what causes this and how can I fix it? </b><br>

            In most instances, a full VIS compile on the level will correct this. Typically, this
            solves the problems. However, if it occurs after a full compile, you've probably got an
            area that's far too complex or big for the Quake2 engine to handle. In which case, you'll
            have to simplify your level.

        <li><b>Why is my map always/never lighted, even though I place entities? (I have a
            leak, btw) </b><br>

            Check your maps for leaks during the BSP compile. If you see the message
            &quot;***Leaked***&quot; any time during that compile, then the VIS and Radiosity
            compilers will not take effect. Hence, the level will either be completely dark or
            fullbright.

		<a name="42">
        <li><b>Ok, I checked and my map doesn't leak, yet it's still not lighted, even though I
            place entities? </b><br>

            Be sure you're running the compilers in order. The proper order is QBSP, then the VIS
            compiler, finally the Radiosity compiler (which handles lighting). Additionally, make sure
            ambient light is set to zero or a decimal value.

            Entities are not calculated during the radiosity compile, so they can't block light.
            So, you get a &quot;leaking&quot; effect since the Q2 engine and light compiler
            pretty much act as if the door isn't there. Unfortunately, there is no way to
            actually prevent this from happening, so you have 2 options: either move the light far
            enough away (or decrease its intensity) from the door or put an offsetting light on the
            other side of the door for a more gradual lighting effect.

            No, a -level # parameter used with the VIS compiler will be ignored by the compiler for
            Quake 2. The -level 4 parameter for the VIS compiler DID improve the quality of
            Quake 1 maps, but with Quake 2 the parameter is ignored. So, while it can be
            specified, it won't actually make any improvements to the maps (nor will it have any
            adverse affects.) It's merely a carryover from the Q1 days.

	<ul>
		<a name="50">
        <li><b>How do I configure difficulty settings for my levels?</b><br>

            A lot will depend on the editor you use. However, difficulty settings are
            configured for entities by the use of spawnflags. If you have to manually enter the
            spawnflag values in your editor, the values are as follows:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Not in Easy=256
				<li>Not in Normal=512
				<li>Not in Hard=1024
				<li>Not in Deathmatch=2048 (not needed for monsters or other items don't appear in DM
					mode)
			</ul><br>
            These values can be combined. For example, if you have a monster that you want to appear
            ONLY in Hard, the spawnflags would be set to 256+512=768.

        <li><b>What are Detail brushes and when should I use them?</b><br>

            Detail brushes are used to help speed up the compile time by &quot;hiding&quot; those
            brushes from the compilers. Since the QBSP compiler breaks up a brush if another
            brush intersects it, this means that a lot of brushes may be created. Detail brushes
            can be used for any brushes that do <b>not</b> block the player's line of site.<br>
            <br>
            This is taken from a text file included with the gamex86.dll source code. The author is
            John Carmack.<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>
            <i>The basic idea is that you should make all of the brushes that aren't major occluders
			into detail brushes. This lets the vis program ignore all of the little protrusions that
			never really block sight. Because of the factorial order of the vis algorithm, it is
			pretty easy to get a 10x speedup in vis time by making the non-essential brushes detail.
			This also gives a method to fight some of the errors that still occur in bsps. If polygons
			are dissapearing in the game, but they come back with &quot;r_novis 1&quot; set, then
			there is a vis error. This can usually be fixed by making more of the brushes between the
			problem viewpoint and the problem polygon into detail brushes.</i>

        <li><b>What are Clip brushes and when should I use them?</b><br>

            Clip brushes are often used to keep a player from getting stuck along a wall, floor or
            ceiling by any brushes that protrude from those surfaces. For example a light
            fixture or a column. There are two methods for using Clip brushes:<br>
            -Create a triangle and put it flush with the sides of the protruding object and another
            side on the wall. This allows the player to be &quot;moved out&quot; slightly when
            moving along the wall.<br>
            -Create a rectangle Clip brush that covers the whole length of the wall and is out far
            enough to cover the edges of the items sticking out of the wall.<br>
            Both methods were used in the original Id levels. Using Clip brushes is <strong>strongly</strong>
            recommended for multiplayer maps.

            Be aware that to really make good maps, you're probably going to have to put in some
            serious time! Of course, it's only a game and you <b>CAN</b> have a life if you
            work at it...otherwise, buy a cat or goldfish since they tend to be less dependent on you
            for survival.

<blockquote>
	<p>The latest Quake II updates are always found at <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/">ID Software</a>. The following is a list of the latest fixes.
</blockquote><br><br>

<hr noshade color="black">

<h3>CHANGES 3.20</h3>
    
- Fixed a network problem where and oversize packet could cause a client crash.<br><br>

- Fixed the long standing Quake2 bug of where you would occasionally spawn or teleport and find yourself either looking straight at the ceiling or down at the floor.<br><br>

- Changed it so that the function keys (F1 through F12) now get executed when depressed during demo playback or attract modes.  This allows you to take screen shots (F12) during demos and other features.  An example of other features is a fast forward for demos:<br><br>

<blockquote>
      alias +ff "timedemo 1"<br>
      alias -ff "timedemo 0"<br>
      bind f7 +ff<br>
</blockquote>
  
This binding will cause the current demo playing to zip into timedemo mode while F7 is depressed, effectively acting like a fast forward key.<br><br>

- Wrong packaging of 3.19 patch.  The Rogue CD has a 45k pak2 and vwep .md2 files in baseq2/players, but the 3.19 x86 patch we released has a 2.7MB pak2.  3.20 has a 45k pak2 and the vwep models go in baseq2/players.<br><br>

- VWep code has been added to Xatrix dll, new VWep models for the Xatrix specific weapons (Ion Ripper and Phalanx) have been included.<br><br>

- Rogue Linux game library was wrong version and had some unlinked symbols,this has been corrected.<br><br>

- Occasional error of: "D_SCAlloc: bad cache width 16384" in software renderer.This had to do with surfaces to SURF_FLOWING and were transparent.  This has been fixed in the refs now so flowing transparent textures now works.<br><br>

- <u>Unix</u> Net_ErrorToString calls were wrong, was using %i and not %s resulting in random numbers being printed for error messages.<br><br>

- Color shell mixing restored to the same blends as previous versions.  This was changed in 3.19 for the new color shells the Rogue mission pack introduced.<br><br>

- Fixed a possible server crash in the new "playerlist" command.<br><br>

- Fixed a case where a person joining a server could be invisible (left over setting of SVF_NOCLIENT from previous spectator).<br><br>

- Invalid pak files no longer cause a crash and are just ignored<br><br>

- Fixed a 3.19 bug where linked models (modelindex2) who's modelindex was greater than 0x7f causes the wrong model to be drawn (in some cases, the world would be drawn twice).  This was the cause of many of the "extreme" frame lag people were seeing in 3.19 on servers using old-style VWep code.<br><br>

- <u>Linux:</u> Complete rewrite of the OpenGL library handling.  This was needed to cleanly integrate OpenGL extension checking.  Linux now supports extensions such as multitexture and better dynamic loading of libraries. It's cleaner now in that you don't have to preload hack stuff to use the 3DFX Miniport rather than libMesa3D.  The Linux version now uses the gl_driver to specify the 3D library to dynamically load.  For example, to use the lib3dfxgl.so miniport, one would now use:<br><br>

<blockquote>
      ./quake2 +set vid_ref gl +set gl_driver lib3dfxgl.so<br>
</blockquote>

This change fixes several bugs that were apparant in the older method, such as a segfault occasionally when connecting to a server with a different game directory. The vid menu in the Linux version has been changed to reflect the new options, the current list of supported video drivers are now:<br><br>

<blockquote>
  software, software X11, Mesa 3-D 3DFX, 3DFXGL Miniport, OpenGL glX, and Mesa 3-D glX<br>
</blockquote>

- Railgun shots now go through gibs as well as other players.<br><br>

- New server variable, "needpass" that can been seen with server browser tools such as GameSpy.  This variable indicates whether a password or spectator password is needed to get onto a server.  Bit 0 is password and bit 1 is spectator password.<br><br>
 
- Quake2 will no longer look for gamex86.dll in the main Quake2 directory. It will always load out of the game directory first.<br><br>

- Players joining a server during an intermission are now moved to the intermission position.<br><br>

- The "logfile" cvar has been extended with the following values:<br><br>

<blockquote>
	0 - don't log (default)<br>
	1 - overwrite qconsole.log and use buffered writes<br>
	2 - overwrite qconsole.log and flush write every line<br>
	3 - append to existing qconsole.log and flush write every line<br>
</blockquote>

- Several minor bug fixes to the Rogue mission pack gamex86.dll<br><br>

- <u>Linux:</u> Rebuild of Rogue mission pack shared library to correct some dynamic symbol errors (is NAN errors).<br><br>

<P>When I first started RUST I didnt want to cover errors because it would be so much work but I've recieved so many emails I decided to do it anyways. This is far from complete and I haven't even tried to explain any of the errors that I know how to fix or what causes them. I just don't have time.</P>

<P>But...I will cut and paste the emails I get from people who know what these error messages mean and how to fix them.</P>

<P>This page is very nasty and I am sure I am missing some errors or made mistakes on a lot of them. All I did was extract them from the source. So if you have any answers to these errors or have errors to add then please tell us.</P>

<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR>

<H3># SubdivideFace didnt split the polygons</H3>
<UL><I>[No Information At Present]</I></UL>


<H3># Mixed Face Contents</H3>

<UL>Content properties all have to be the same for a brush...you cant have 2 different ones on one brush...this is different for surface properties.</UL>



<H3># numvertexes == MAX_MAP_VERTS</H3>

<UL>The map is too big, it exceeds some of Quake 2/qbsp3/qrad3/qvis3's internal maximums. Simplify, make it smaller, or split it up.</UL>



  <H3># Leak***</H3>

          <UL>you have a hole in your map. Your map must be completely closed. Most editors come with leaking finding tools.</UL>



  <H3># bad planenum</H3>

          <UL>The map is too big, it exceeds some of Quake 2/qbsp3/qrad3/qvis3's internal maximums. Simplify, make it smaller, or split it up. Quake 2 has a limit of 65536 planes it can support and a brush has a face that excedes that limit.</UL>



  <H3># Tried parent</H3>

          <UL>A brush has a surface that is in the same plane as a parent entity. This is checked when splitting brushes up and building the partitions for later processing. The most likely source of the problem is that a brush is malformed and needs to be fixed up or removed.</UL> 



  <H3># PSIDE_FACING with splits</H3>

          <UL>This error should never occur due to the way that the conditions required to cause it. The source is checking a surface property and the number of splits for a brush that are necessary. However the routine that would generate the conditions for this error has an #if 0 / #endif around the part that would set the second condition for this error code (s&PSIDE_FACING) so noone should ever see this error. If they do, Id love to see the .MAP and find out how!</UL> 



  <H3># Can't write mapname</H3>

          <UL>There is a problem with your HD, it might be full. Is your map file opened in another program?</UL>



  <H3># HashVec: point outside valid range</H3>

          <UL>There's a vertex outside the valid range. The maximum extents of a Quake 2 level is (in all dimensions) -4096 to +4096.</UL>



  <H3># GetVertexnum: outside +/- 4096</H3>

          <UL>These are "map is too damn big" errors. Somewhere the map is out of the +/- 4096 bounds. Make your map smaller or make sure its in the middle and not way off to the side of the bounds.</UL> 



  <H3># MAX_SUPERVERTS</H3>

          <UL>The map is too big, it exceeds some of Quake 2/qbsp3/qrad3/qvis3's internal maximums. Simplify, make it smaller, or split it up.</UL> 



  <H3># numedges == MAX_MAP_EDGES</H3>

          <UL>The map is too big, it exceeds some of Quake 2/qbsp3/qrad3/qvis3's internal maximums. Simplify, make it smaller, or split it up.</UL> 



  <H3># SubdivideFace: didn't split the polygon</H3>
<UL><I>[No Information At Present]</I></UL>


  <H3># Winsock initialization failed</H3>

          <UL>When the -draw flag is specified, then QBSP3 will attempt to open a WinSOCK connection to the GLServer port of 25001. However since noone ever inits the drawflag in the C code, it is up to the compiler to decide if it is set to NULL or if it not init'd. The latter case means that some compilers may cause drawflag to be accidentally set due to memory garbage. In any case, this problem should only really appear when the user specifies '-draw' on the QBSP3 command line and they do not have WinSOCK (TCP/IP) installed on their system. Two simple workarounds for this are:<BR><BR>
<UL>


         <LI>Do not set the -draw flag on the QBSP3 command line. This should be something that most users dont do anyways!<BR><BR>
         <LI>Install the Netscape "fake" WinSOCK.dll file (called Mosock.dll or something funky like that). It is essentially a WinSOCK.dll that contains NULL WinSOCK routines so that a client does not really have to install and configure TCP/IP on their clients but they can use it when viewing local web pages.<BR><BR>
         <LI>A third workaround is something that more advanced users can do: simply rename qbsp3\gldraw.c to qbsp3\ogldraw.c and rename qbsp3\nodraw.c to qbsp3\gldraw.c. This effectively stubs out all of the Draw_* routines that come from processing the tree nodes.</UL></UL>



  <H3># draw_socket failed</H3>

          <UL>Related to the Winsock error above. The reason for the failure is that WinSOCK coudl not create a socket for steaming the data to later on. The same answers for dealing with this apply from the error above.</UL> 



  <H3># Couldn't open</H3>

          <UL>This error occurs 2 times. One time is when QBSP3 attempts to create and open the .GL file (if the user put -glview on the command line). If QBSP3 gets ANY error doing this, it stops w/o indicating what the error may be. The second time is when QBSP3 attempts to create and open the .LIN file to save the leak information. The most common reasons for either failing is probably lack of disk space or if you are attempting to save to a network file server, no rights to create new files (although why QBSP3 doesnt give the same error when generating the .PRT or .BSP files is something Id have to look at later).</UL> 



  <H3># Can't write expanded.map</H3>

          <UL>You did not list this error but it is in the code. This is the error that QBSP3 generates when it cannot create the file named expanded.map. This file is generated if QBSP3 is unable to create the file that would contain all the new brush info. This file is generated in TestExpandBrushes() just before QBSP3 gives the can't proceed after expanding brushes error message. However upon diggin into the code more I noticed that the routine TestExpandBrushes() is never called (its call in LoadMapFile() is commented out). As a result, no one should EVER see this error message.</UL> 



  <H3># FloatPlane: bad normal</H3>

          <UL>Happens with vertex editing when the geometry is invalid, for example when you alter the number of faces (ie: take a block [6 sides], take two vertices from the top and bring them over the lower 2 vertices to transform the block brush in a wedge [5 sides]. The face isn't a plane anymore (now an edge) so the normal can't be calculated).</UL> 



  <H3># MAX_MAP_PLANES</H3>

         <UL>The map is too big, it exceeds some of Quake 2/qbsp3/qrad3/qvis3's internal maximums. Simplify, make it smaller, or split it up.</UL> 



  <H3># MAX_MAP_BRUSHSIDES</H3>

          <UL>The map is too big, it exceeds some of Quake 2/qbsp3/qrad3/qvis3's internal maximums. Simplify, make it smaller, or split it up.</UL> 



  <H3># nummapbrushes == MAX_MAP_BRUSHES</H3>

          <UL>The map is too big, it exceeds some of Quake 2/qbsp3/qrad3/qvis3's internal maximums. Simplify, make it smaller, or split it up.</UL> 



  <H3># parsing brush</H3>

          <UL>Your map file contains an error, so qbsp3 couldn't parse it. You'll probably need to fix it with a text editor.</UL> 



  <H3># Entity %i, Brush %i: origin brushes not allowed in world</H3>

          <UL>Caused by having the origin (center) of the Origin brush outside the bursh it is meant to rotate (func_rotating error). It occurs when you apply the "origin" surface property to a brush that is not a func_rotate(door) entity. In other words it happens when you give an origin surface property to a world brush.</UL> 



  <H3># ParseEntity: { not found</H3>

          <UL>Your map file contains an error, so qbsp3 couldn't parse it. You'll probably need to fix it with a text editor.</UL> 



  <H3># num_entities == MAX_MAP_ENTITIES</H3>

          <UL>too many entities...delete some or divide your map into 2 maps</UL>



  <H3># ParseEntity: EOF without closing brace</H3>

          <UL>Your map file contains an error, so qbsp3 couldn't parse it. You'll probably need to fix it with a text editor.</UL> 



  <H3># Entity %i: func_areaportal can only be a single brush</H3>

          <UL>A func_areaportal can only have one brush attached.</UL> 



  <H3># can't proceed after expanding brushes</H3>

          <UL>No one should ever see this error message</UL>



  <H3># Portal_EntityFlood: not a leaf</H3>
<UL><I>[No Information At Present]</I></UL>

  <H3># AddPortalToNode: allready included</H3>
<UL><I>[No Information At Present]</I></UL>

  <H3># MAX_MAP_AREAS</H3>

          <UL>The map is too big, it exceeds some of Quake 2/qbsp3/qrad3/qvis3's internal maximums. Simplify, make it smaller, or split it up.</UL> 

  <H3># Unknown option</H3>

          <UL>you ran qbsp3 with an unknown option. Look here for a list of all the options</UL>

  <H3># Tried to invoke command line that wasnt valid</H3>

          <UL>you ran qbsp3 with an unknown option. Look here for a list of all the options</UL>

  <H3># usage: qbsp3 [options] mapfile</H3>

          <UL>you need to specify the map file to compile. Check here for all your options</UL>

  <H3># MAX_MAP_TEXTURES</H3>

          <UL>The map is too big, it exceeds some of Quake 2/qbsp3/qrad3/qvis3's internal maximums. Simplify, make it smaller, or split it up.</UL> 

  <H3># node->faces seperating CONTENTS_SOLID</H3>

  <H3># PruneNodes: node->brushlist</H3>
<UL><I>[No Information At Present]</I></UL>

  <H3># Bad leafface</H3>

          <UL>When writing out the information about the faces to the BSP file, one had a face number larger than the largest one QBSP3 knows about. This should typically be due to some memory overwrite problems or some internal flow problems rather than anything the user did. I dont have any suggestions on how to fix the problem w/o actually debugging on a .MAP that could generate this error...</UL> 



  <H3># MAX_MAP_LEAFFACES</H3>

          <UL>The map is too big, it exceeds some of Quake 2/qbsp3/qrad3/qvis3's internal maximums. Simplify, make it smaller, or split it up.</UL> 



  <H3># MAX_MAP_LEAFS</H3>

          <UL>The map is too big, it exceeds some of Quake 2/qbsp3/qrad3/qvis3's internal maximums. Simplify, make it smaller, or split it up.</UL> 



  <H3># MAX_MAP_LEAFBRUSHES</H3>

          <UL>The map is too big, it exceeds some of Quake 2/qbsp3/qrad3/qvis3's internal maximums. Simplify, make it smaller, or split it up.</UL> 



  <H3># MAX_MAP_FACES</H3>

          <UL>The map is too big, it exceeds some of Quake 2/qbsp3/qrad3/qvis3's internal maximums. Simplify, make it smaller, or split it up.</UL> 



  <H3># MAX_MAP_SURFEDGES</H3>

          <UL>The map is too big, it exceeds some of Quake 2/qbsp3/qrad3/qvis3's internal maximums. Simplify, make it smaller, or split it up. </UL>



  <H3># MAX_MAP_NODES</H3>

          <UL>The map is too big, it exceeds some of Quake 2/qbsp3/qrad3/qvis3's internal maximums. Simplify, make it smaller, or split it up. 
</UL>


  <H3># WriteDrawNodes_r: odd planenum</H3>
<UL><I>[No Information At Present]</I></UL>

  <H3># stylenum == MAX_SWITCHED_LIGHTS</H3>

          <UL>The map is too big, it exceeds some of Quake 2/QBSP3 internal maximums. You can only have a maxium of 32 switched (ie: targetname light1) lights in Quake2. It is not clear if a light w/a targetname but is not really targeted counts towards this tally or not. To be safe, lights that are not switched should not have a targetname (until someone can verify that this does not matter). Remove some switched lights until you have less than 32.</UL>



  <H3># MAX_MAP_BRUSHSIDES</H3>

          <UL>The map is too big, it exceeds some of Quake 2/qbsp3/qrad3/qvis3's internal maximums. Simplify, make it smaller, or split it up.</UL> 



  <H3># MAX_MAP_MODELS</H3>

          <UL>The map is too big, it exceeds some of Quake 2/qbsp3/qrad3/qvis3's internal maximums. Simplify, make it smaller, or split it up.</UL>

<br><br>

<p>I started studying the subject of Quake brushes when I was first starting my TC (<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/gunman/">http://www.planetquake.com/gunman/</a>). My aim has always been to push the Quake engine to its fullest potential. I read a quick little description of how the brushes work, and wrote a few programs to allow me to make brushes with my 3D program and convert them to .map format. I spent several weeks discovering, by trial and error, the techniques needed to make practically anything out of brushes. What I know is just the result of alot of hard thinking, and staring at a computer screen. I havent talked to Carmack or anyone that is really educated on the subject of 3d engines, and I'm sure that if I did, I'd have more to say on this subject.

<br><br><b>BRUSH DESCRIPTION</b>

<p>Brushes are of course the building blocks that the level is made from. They are always convex because of the way they are created. Imagine a world made of styro-foam that goes forever in all directions. To make a brush, you make infinitely large slices in the foam, and what is left over from that whole universe of styro-foam is your brush. You can imagine how easy it would be to forget a slice or two and end up with a brush that goes off into infinity. Its also obvious that you cant create a single brush that has a dent or "concave" surface on it, because each slice you make goes forever... you'd always chop-off parts of the brush that would have caused it to have the concave shape in the first place. In the old days of Quake1, brushes had to have 16 or less "slices" to compile, but now you can find QBSPs that have the ability to create brushes with 256 slices, and QBSP3 seems to allow alot of slices too.

<p><div align="center"><img border="0" width="450"  src="/content/quake2/tutorials/abrush/abrush_img1.gif"></div>

<br><br><b>THE "KNIFE"</b>

<p>How do you make the slices? Its easy. You define the slicing plane with three points... essentially a triangle. Each point's coordinates are whole numbers with no decimals (this is due to the .map format). In the world of 3D graphics, each triangle that makes up an object either faces IN or OUT depending on whether the triangle was made clockwise or counterclockwise. That "direction" is called the "normal" and it's used to tell which side of the plane to discard. You want your normals to face INWARD, or you will chop-off the interior of the brush, rather than the stuff on the outside. But now it gets complicated. Think of a cube. It would in fact be made up of 6 triangles, rather than 6 squares. To add to the confusion, you could have the points that define each plane appear anywhere on that plane... so-long as the "normal" still points inward. There are a zillion possible ways to make a cube then, but in some respects, each way will result in a cube that will behave differently when you manipulate it (shearing, rotation etc.)

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/abrush/abrush_img2.gif"></div>

<br><br><b>THE .MAP FORMAT</b>

<p>Here is an example of a cutting plane in the .map format:

<blockquote>
1.000000 ( -225 -265 -145 ) ( -175 -235 -170 ) ( -225 -215 -170 ) CAVE_3 0 0 0 1.000000
</blockquote>

<p>The numbers within the parentheses are the X-Y-Z coordinates for the three points of a cutting plane. Notice that all vertices (points that define each "slice" or "plane") end up being integers (no decimals) in the .map format. This is what causes alot of the errors and gaps and mis-alignments in your Quake maps. The problem is that when you rotate a brush to anything but 90 degree angles, it is almost guaranteed that most or all of your cutting planes will contain decimal values, which will be truncated when you save as .map to compile. This causes shapes to change slightly... For example... imagine a small cube that is rotated only a few degrees. You never know how the vertices will be rounded off--some may move, some may round back to where they started. So you could end up with something that was no-longer even a true cube. Now imagine a cube that has its plane-vertices spread far apart... beyond the visible corners of the cube-brush. You could rotate this cube with a greater degree of accuracy. "Big deal!" you say. But it IS a big deal when it comes to brushes that must match up to other brushes perfectly. For instance, a rectangle and a square may match up perfectly until you rotate them as a group. If the rotation is some oddball angle, like 21 degrees, you may end up with the brushes overlapping, or you may have a VERY THIN gap between them. That is BAD. If the overlap is very small, you will get some sort of funny error, and Qbsp will choke on it. If there is a gap, you end up with extra faces to draw, and I'm sure plenty of extra crap for vis to deal with too. You can also get those annoying black spots and shading errors. Of course, the solution to this would be for the smaller cube-shaped brush to have the vertices on the side that meets up with the rectangle be in the same exact place as the rectangle's vertices. This will allow the square brush to fit perfectly against the rectangular brush no matter how you rotated it. Another thing that causes errors would be "duplicate planes". If you have two triangles that define the same plane, you either get a simple warning, or Qbsp will choke. Sometimes if you shrink a brush that has two planes that are very nearly at the same angle, the truncating effect of the .map format will cause them to actually BECOME identical. So small size can cause trouble for fancy brushwork... unless the points that define the planes are placed beyond the edges of the actual brush, resulting in greater accuracy. The same kind of errors can show up when you start "shearing" or otherwise fiddling with a brush in programs like WorldCraft etc. So I guess the moral to the story is this: you have alot more control of brushes than you might imagine. You just have to be able to build them at the most basic level.

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/abrush/abrush_img3.gif"></div>

<br><br><b>BRUSH SCULPTING</b>

<p>As far as I know, there is no Quake-specific program out there that lets you really get to the guts of a brush. Clipping tools and vertex editing help, but are rather clumsy for any real precision work. I prefer using a 3D modeling program to make special-purpose brush prefabs. You will need a program that allows you to create 3D objects with the ability to manually add and delete faces, and change the normals on the faces individually. It's a simple job to convert .raw or .txt saved files to the .map format so that you can include it into the normal map editors like WorldCraft etc. There is a program that supposedly converts .3ds to .map out there. I have tried it, and it doesnt work well at all on any but the simplest of shapes. 

<br><br><b>SHAPES TO AVOID</b>

<p>Its not so much the shape of a brush you should avoid, but rather the shape of certain FACES on brushes that match-up to other brushes that you should beware of. A sure-fire way to get those nasty little gaps and overlaps is to try to match-up faces that have more than 3 corners AND are not square AND are rotated on more than one axis. This is just the type of thing that causes those strange qbsp compiling problems when you try to use "Subtraction" features in the level-editing programs. You end up with corners on your brush that are not on any of the vertices that form the cutting planes, and these corners very rarely are going to end up with X-Y-Z on even numbers. When I create prefabs of smooth, biological structures, I always try to avoid faces that have more than 3 corners, unless the plane is on a 90 degree angle. This ensures that all the corners of the brushes will match-up flawlessly. However, it can really cause qbsp to chop-up the level. Especially when you use a bunch of these triangular-based brushes to create a concave surface.

<br><br><b>SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS</b>

<p>If you load a brush that you created into WorldCraft, and it complains "1 brushes were not loaded, due to errors" it probably means you ended up with a duplicate plane. There are a few ways to deal with that. Go into you modeling program and look for 2 very similar planes. Together, they make a square. Delete the two triangles that make-up that square, and replace them with triangles crossing the square in the opposite direction. Sometimes this is all it takes. If that fails, you can try slightly adjusting the size of the whole prefab. This will cause the vertices to be truncated differently for the .map format. Sometimes a slight rescaling makes all the difference and gets rid of your duplicate planes for you. Remember, larger brushes=more accuracy for the cutting planes. The last solution is to find the trouble-making plane, and extend the vertices defining that plane out to a distance where they can gain more accuracy. This is actually pretty difficult for some angles, so I avoid getting in to this situation whenever possible! One thing that I notice is that Worldcraft seems to load brushes and convert them to something that REPRESENTS the brush, but doesnt actually function like a brush. When you have corners on a brush that are the result of the cutting planes and dont actually have any vertices on them, it is legal for them to be on coordinates that have decimal places (figure A). The later versions of WC try to snap vertices to the nearest integer when you rotate or otherwise manipulate a brush... which is fine for most brushes, but will not accurately represent the final product. I find that it works best if you rotate complex brush sculptures in the 3D editing program and export them to WC

<br><br><b>R_SPEEDS</b>

<p>I'm sure you're thinking, "Well, I'm sure you can create some really cool things with brushes, but I bet it slows the game WAY down!". Sure, that can happen. But if you use fancy brushwork in combination with more simple forms, your r_speeds will be just fine. Think about it... a few staircases can give you hundreds of triangles for Quake to draw. Stairs have ALOT of different planes, and they cut up the walls next to them. Now, would you rather have an awesome brush model in the room and a simple ramp, or nothing cool in the room and yet-another staircase?

	<blockquote>
		Area Light - <a href="mailto:granny@gamedesign.net">GrrandMaMa</a>
	</blockquote>
<br><br>

<p>One of the things I've always dreaded doing when building is area lighting. I can have all of my sourced lighting up and going, all my spot lighting and texture lighting set and done, but there are always dark spots (usually in the center of a fairly large room with a high ceiling.) So, the next step (for me) was to put a whole bunch of low-brightness lights close to the floor (usually 150 brighness, about 64 units off the floor) and space them out to put a dim cover. Just enough to put light where I need it, but not enough to overpower the sourced lights. And then there is the matter of coloring them. 

<p>All in all, it works well, but it takes a long time to get it just right, and it's just a general pain in the ass. There is however, another way that gives nearly perfect coverage, and is (most importantly) fast and easy to adjust to get it looking just right.

<p>Let's look at a particular area.

<p><div align="center"><img border="0" width="450"  src="/content/quake2/tutorials/alight/alight_img1.jpg"></div>

<p>Notice how the center of the room is dark. Now, if we were to put a light, bright enough to cover the dark area, in the center of the dark spot, it would flood out the sourced lighting from the lights in the wals near the floor. So, now we have a problem just like the one I described above, but instead of using cover lighting using point lighting like I described above, we'll do something different -- texture lighting. I know, that would look pretty bad to light up the floor. Don't worry, we're not going to use the floor. 

<p><b>First thing we need to do</b> is find a texture that will give us the color we need when we light it. In this case, we'll use the texture for the wall-mounted lights.

<p><b>Next, create a brush </b>that covers the general area, a bit off the floor (no, I'm not going to tell you exactly how far, because it's something you have to play with.) 

<p>You should have something like this:

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/alight/alight_img2.jpg"></div>

<p>Now we set the properties for the brush. Set the following flags <b>on all faces</b> of the brush:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
	<li><b>light:</b> Well, why else would we be doing this?<br>
    <li><b>sky:</b> This way it will still emit light, even though it won't be drawn<br>
	<li><b>nodraw:</b> A big light brush probably wouldn't look too good in the middle of a room<br>
	<li><b>detail:</b> Since it is a sky brush, it will be a     factor in your PVS unless this is checked, which means you'll be having sky pop up in all kinds of wierd places. Trust me... check this<br>
	<li><b>mist:</b> If you don't check mist, people will be wondering who stuck a big clip brush in the middle of the room<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep the light value <b>very</b> low.

<p><b>NOTE</b>: This will <b>dramatically</b> increase your QRAD3 times. Just thought I'd let you know.

<p>Now compile it, and you should come up with something like this:

<p><div align="center"><img border="0" width="450"  src="/content/quake2/tutorials/alight/alight_img3.jpg"></div>

<p>It's a subtle difference, but every little bit counts (and it looks pretty good too)

	<blockquote>
		Clip Brush Q&A - Various
	</blockquote> 
	
<br><br><b>Do I REALLY need to use Clip brushes?  It seems like a lot of tedious work!</b>

<p>The harsh reality is that creating Clip brushes in levels, especially large ones, is a pretty tedious job.  Especially since you'll typically want to add them after doing all of the structural and texture work of your level.  So, it's one thing that is often overlooked by most mappers.

<p>However, if you want your map to be played, or at the very least be enjoyed by many people (which is the reason most people publish maps), then you really should spend the time creating Clip brushes.  Nothing is more frustrating in a deathmatch game than to be running backwards while firing, only to be stuck by a small light fixture!

<br><br><b>Is preventing the player from getting stuck the only practical use for Clip brushes?</b>

<p>No. Clip brushes can be used in a variety of situations.  For example, let's say you created a hole in a wall from an explosion.   In this hole, you had the quad damage.  While everything might be setup by brushes for the player to crawl into that gap, the player might not be able to get out.   In this case, you could create a ramp with the clip brush to make it easier for the player to get back out.

<br><br><b>Can I use Clip brushes TOO much?</b>

<p>Like any tool or technique in Quake 2 editing, it's sometimes easy to go overboard.  Keep in mind you can't ever completely prevent the player from getting stuck.  Likewise, it's also very easy to abuse Clip brushes by putting them in a place where they block the player's movement with no indication as to why.  While this may be a interesting effect for a while, it very quickly becomes frustrating.

<p>As with everything else in Quake 2, be sure to test your level after adding Clip brushes - it's very easy to forget you're working in a 3D world - and that Clip brush which keeps the player from getting snagged on the first floor may end up accidentally blocking a doorway on the second floor!

<br><br><b>I just have some small light fixtures along my wall and using Clip brushes seems a bit too tedious.   Is there another way to handle this?</b>

<p>If you've got a lot of small items sticking out of a wall, you can change their content property to Mist (or AUX) which allows the player to pass through them without the need for Clip brushes.  However, this is really only useful for small items since the player passes completely through the object.  So, if you had some big columns, this technique probably wouldn't be practical.  But, for small light fixtures, this is sometimes quicker and easier than using Clip brushes!

<p></ul><h1 id="48" name="48" class="book-h2">Colored Light</h1><ul><h3>Quake 2</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Colored Light - <a href="mailto:fishman@gamedesign.net">Shane 'Fishman' Sherman</a>
	</blockquote>

<p>The one thing that I think makes quake2 one of the best looking games ever is colored lighting. The difference in visual quality between the software version with no colored lights and the hardware version with colored light support is like night and day. It adds so much atmosphere to the game. id made it very easy to use colored lighting when level designing and hopefully I can give some tips on the best ways to use them to their full potential. If you know all about colored lights and using them then you might want to skip to the bottom and check out my tips. Some of them can be very useful. 
	
<br><br><b>How do I use colored light?</b> 

<p>There are 2 ways you can produce colored lights:

<p>First way is the typical light entity with the key value pair <b>_color</b> and a value of the RGB code of the color you want.

<p>The second way is to have a texture radiate light. What's cool about this is whatever color the texture is that is the color the light will be. This is my preferred choice with using colored lights. Why? It gives off a much more realistic color of light. <em>It's much easier to let the light texture radiate the color then trying to match that color with a light entity</em>. 

<br><br><b>Why do some user made levels look like shit?</b> 

<p>It is very easy to overuse colored light. A lot of the first user made levels I have seen have severely overused colored light. Here are a few examples of overused colored lights:

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/clight/clight_img1.jpg">

<p>Blue and Red? Very unnatural light.

</div>

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/clight/clight_img2.jpg">

<p>Lime green...yuck.

</div>

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/clight/clight_img3.jpg">

<p>Not bad but still too much -- 5 different colors in one shot.

</div>

<p>Now if these people just let the surfaces radiate most of the light for them then they would get a much more natural look and feel. I'm not saying never use light entities i'm just saying to let the surfaces do some of the work for you.

<br><br><b>How do I made a surface emit light?</b> 

<p>To make a surface emit light, you must you the edit the surface properties of that brush or surface. There is a surface Property flag called light. For a better explanation on how to edit the surface properties and the light property I suggest you read my surface/content properties tutorial. It will explain everything you need to know on how to edit the surface properties. 

<br><p><b>Hints and Tips</b><br><br>


<p>Here are a couple of tricks I have figured out about colored light that might be able to help you:

<ul>
   <li>Values don't have to be between 0 and 1. The can be between 0 and 255 like normal RGB colors.<br><br>
        
   <li>Try using your favorite paint program and pick the color you want and write down the RGB code.<br><br>
        
   <li>Most editors have a color button that allows you to select the color from a pallete. Very handy!<br><br>
        
   <li>Sometimes when having a surface emit light, you will have to set the value EXTREMELY high depending on the size of the face or brush. Light values as high as 10000 are not uncommon. This is only with surface emitting light though.<br><br>

<p><i>Original tutorial provided by Ricebug, written with QERadiant in mind.</i>

<p><font face="Arial">This tutorial will involve making an outside area and sky box. For making
realistic-looking landscape, we will also be using the stand-alone version of

<p><font face="Arial">4. Compare the bitmap below with the wireframe preview in Figure 1 above. The
black areas dictate the lower elevation, while the whiter areas cause the ground
to swell upward. Lightwave and 3DSMax users know this as &quot;displacement
mapping.&quot; For example, by drawing thick, black lines on a white background,
you can easily define drainage ditches or culverts. In reverse, drawing thick,
white lines on a black background will give you walls. Shades of gray in between
black &amp; white will cause variations in the height of your walls. Some
interesting landscapes can be created with a little imagination.</font></p>

  <p>In g_func.c, look for this code in the function SP_func_plat:</p>

<blockquote><code>
  ent->moveinfo.sound_start = gi.soundindex ("plats/pt1_strt.wav");</br> 
ent->moveinfo.sound_middle = gi.soundindex ("plats/pt1_mid.wav");</br> 
ent->moveinfo.sound_end = gi.soundindex ("plats/pt1_end.wav");</br>
</code></blockquote>

  <p>and replace it with this:</p>

<blockquote><code>
if (ent->style > 0 && ent->style < 100) // custom sounds</br> 
{</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_start = gi.soundindex  (va("plats/pt%02i_strt.wav", ent->style));</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_middle = gi.soundindex  (va("plats/pt%02i_mid.wav", ent->style));</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_end = gi.soundindex  (va("plats/pt%02i_end.wav", ent->style));</br> 
}</br> 
else</br> 
{</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_start = gi.soundindex ("plats/pt1_strt.wav");</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_middle = gi.soundindex ("plats/pt1_mid.wav");</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_end = gi.soundindex ("plats/pt1_end.wav");</br> 
}</br> 
</code></blockquote>

  <p>This change could also be added to the func_trackchange entity in Lazarus.</p>

<h3>Step 2:</h3>

  <p>In the SP_func_button, replace the following:</p>

<blockquote><code>
if (ent->sounds != 1)</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_start = gi.soundindex("switches/butn2.wav");</br> 
</code></blockquote>

  <p>with this:</p>

<blockquote><code>
if (ent->style > 0 && ent->style < 100) // custom sounds</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_start = gi.soundindex (va("switches/butn%02i.wav", ent->style));</br> 
else if (ent->sounds != 1)</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_start = gi.soundindex ("switches/butn2.wav");</br> 
else</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_start = 0;</br> 
</code></blockquote>

<h3>Step 3:</h3>

  <p>In both the  SP_func_door and SP_func_door_rotating, replace this:</p>

<blockquote><code>
if (ent->sounds != 1)</br> 
{</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_start = gi.soundindex  ("doors/dr1_strt.wav");</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_middle = gi.soundindex  ("doors/dr1_mid.wav");</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_end = gi.soundindex  ("doors/dr1_end.wav");</br> 
}</br> 
</code></blockquote>

  <p>and replace it with this:</p>

<blockquote><code>
if (ent->style > 0 && ent->style < 100) // custom sounds</br> 
{</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_start = gi.soundindex  (va("doors/dr%02i_strt.wav", ent->style));</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_middle = gi.soundindex  (va("doors/dr%02i_mid.wav", ent->style));</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_end = gi.soundindex  (va("doors/dr%02i_end.wav", ent->style));</br> 
}</br> 
else if (ent->sounds != 1)</br> 
{</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_start = gi.soundindex  ("doors/dr1_strt.wav");</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_middle = gi.soundindex  ("doors/dr1_mid.wav");</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_end = gi.soundindex  ("doors/dr1_end.wav");</br> 
}</br> 
else</br> 
{</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_start = 0;</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_middle = 0;</br> 
   ent->moveinfo.sound_end = 0;</br> 
}</br> 
</code></blockquote>

<h3>Comments</h3>

  <p>I decided to use the style key for custom sounds because many maps may have different sounds values set for doors. The default QERadiant .def file has door sound sets listed that are from Q1, and many mappers may have given their doors sounds values other than 0 and 1 (default and no sound). I didn't want to change the behavior of existing maps.</p>

	<blockquote>
		Environmental Maps - <a href="mailto:fishman@gamedesign.net">Shane "Fishman" Sherman</a>
	</blockquote>
	
<p>One of the coolest new things in Quake2 are the environment maps. The only problem is that there is not a great variety of them in Quake2. They are <b>unit1_</b> through <b>unit9_</b> and <b>space1</b>. The unit maps are all of the alien world backgrounds and space is the one used on the last few levels. To view these in a map just type <b>sky</b> <i>name of sky</i> at the console.<br><br>

What if you dont like any of the Quake2 environment maps? Well make your own. This is what I will attempt to show you how to do. It's not very easy though.<br><br>

First thing you have to do is draw the art which is by far the hardest part. The environment map acts like a cube around your level so there must be 6 seperate pictures; up, down, left, right, front, back. They aren't orientated the way you think they are though... Below are some screenshots of some of the Quake2 env. maps so you can see what sides must match the other sides.<br><br>

<p><div align="center"><img src="content/quake2/tutorials/env_maps/env_maps_img1.jpg"></div>

<p>The unit5_ environment map.

<p><div align="center"><img src="content/quake2/tutorials/env_maps/env_maps_img2.jpg"></div>

<p>The space1_ environment map.

<p><hr width=75% color=black noshade><p>

<p>Each image <b>must be 256x256 pixels and there must be 2 seperate sets of images</b>. This is because there must be a set of 6 24 bit color tga files for people with 3d acceleration cards and a set of 6 8 bit color pcx files for people without. Remember though that the 8 bit color pictures must be converted to the quake2 pallete. You can get the quake2.act photoshop file on the <A HREF="../../quake2files.shtml">files</A> page.<br><br>

The last thing you need to do is <b>end all your image file names with: bk, dn, ft, lf, rt, and up</b>. These stand for back, down, front, left, right, and up.<br><br>

So if we made a new environment map called earth1 these are the image files we would have to have: earth1bk.tga, earth1dn.tga, earth1ft.tga, earth1lf.tga, earth1rt.tga, earth1up.tga, earth1bk.pcx, earth1dn.pcx, earth1ft.pcx, earth1lf.pcx, earth1rt.pcx, and earth1up.pcx. All of these images would be 256x256 pixels in size.<br><br>

Once you have all your art done and you want to see what it looks like in a level then all you need to do is create a directory off of your /quake2/baseq2 dir called env. and put all the files in that directory. Then load up quake and start playing and type sky <i>name of sky you made</i>. So with earth1 we would type sky earth1.<br><br>

To actually get the sky to appear from the beginning you will need to add sky <i>name of sky</i> to your worldspawn entity. You can also make the sky rotate by adding a <b>skyaxis</b> and a <b>skyrotate</b> key and value into the worldspawn. Thats about all there is to creating your own environmental maps. The hardest part is the art but there are some programs that will make it easier. The one is called Bryce2 which is a 3d landscape creator. There is also a photoshop plugin at <a href="http://www.wasabisoft.com/" target="_top">http://www.wasabisoft.com/</a> that lets you create cubic graphics that you might want to check out. You might also like to have a good graphic editing program. I prefer Photoshop4. also remember that you will have to include your homemade environment map with any level you distribute if you want other people to be able to see it.<br><br>

<p>
First off, be warned: this is not a new tutorial on how to make and use a func_areaportal. If you need to know how to make one, check out fishman's tutorial on that very thing.
</p>
<p>
Now, the purpose of this mini-tutorial is to familiarize you with one of the problems you will almost undoubtedly come across when you are using func_areaportals: the dreaded <strong>"func_areaportal [entity number] doesn't touch two areas"</strong> error. Don't worry, it's a pretty simple thing.
</p>
<p><strong>A func_areaportal must entirely separate two areas.</strong> That's it; it's that simple. This means that there can be no "leaks" (for lack of a better word) between the areas on either side of the areaportal. 
<p>
<strong>Anything that does not completely block vis, such as windows, holes, func_walls, detail brushes, transparent brushes, brushes with the mist flag set, liquid, etcetera, etcetera, will generate the error</strong> if that brush or entity connects the two areas. If, on the other hand, another func_areaportal is used, the error is gone. Makes sense, because the very purpose of the areaportal is to block vis.
</p>
<p>
What it all boils down to is this: If you get this error, <strong>make sure that the only way for you or the engine to get (or see) from one side of an areaportal to the other, is through an areaortal</strong> (doesn't have to be the same one.)
<HR>
</p>
<p>Another little thing, and a bonus for sitting through my feeble attempt at coherency:
</p>
<h4>Func_areaportals and multi-part doors.</H4>
<p>
(WooHoo! Excited?) There are a few ways to do muti-part doors, and this is just one. One of the doors in the <a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/maps/func_ap.zip">example map</A> is a two-part door, for reference.
</p>
<p>Quick and simple. First, create your door, and place one areaportal inside the doorway, just like the door was one piece. Now, give all of the pieces of the door a matching "team" key. For example,                 "door1". Now all of your door pieces have "team"="door1". Next step: set one of the door pieces to target the areaportal. Thats it. 
</p>
<p>There are a few good things about this. First, you won't have to worry about one side of a door triggering the areaportal off, and the other trigering it back on. Second, in the case of an especially wide door, no matter how you approach the door, it will always open all at once.

<p>
Some people have problems with the Areaportal entity in Quake 2. Usually, they can get an areaportal setup, and compiling correctly (no errors of the "doesn't touch two areas", or "touches more than two areas" variety). Still, the
infamous hall of mirrors effect will appear. Sometimes it even appears on a previously working Areaportal, after you've added another.
</p>
<p>
Here is a tip to put into your arsenal, to make more or less perfect areaportals. Actually, it's also a door design technique. You need to isolate the door. Completely. Take a look at the accomanying graphic. Here you see a door between two rooms. This could be a door between a room and a hallyway, or between two <b>DIFFERENT</b> hallways. Many people when creating an Areaportal,
actually wind up putting the Areaportal touching two areas, say 1 and 2, but frequently put the areaportal within one of these areas. Therein lies the problem.
</p>
<p>
An Areaportal, I find, has to be <b>BETWEEN</b> two areas, not part of either. Sometimes the HOM effect won't appear with just two portals, but when you have 6 or 7 (like on my map) it eventually happens. Create a box to contain your door. Cut out the hole for the door, being sure to leave some brush on all sides (except the walkway of course). When you create the door, be sure it won't touch the adjacent rooms, and is inset a little. Put the areaportal within the door. You can let it extend into the surrounding brush, but don't let it touch the void.
</p>
<p>
That's it. I have yet to create a door using this technique, with an areaportal, and get the hall of mirrors effect. This works for anykind of door, even rotating ones, and multisegmented doors too. There may be those who say you don't need to do this exactly like this, and sometimes I think that's true, but I find this one so far, has worked 100% of the time for me.

<p>By Joel Caesar</p>

<p>
Areaportals (or APs) tend to be one of the more problematic elements of Quake2. I've found that time after time, people are reading the previous tutorials and are STILL not able to get them working correctly. I almost couldn't believe it, thinking these other people were doing something wrong. Until I was working on a tower in an outdoor area map, I didn't realize that many of the terms related to APs are understood differently. This addendum is a brief recap of some of the previous tutorials, but is not meant as a replacement for all of them.
</p>

<p>I will cover the following items:</p>

<p>
1. A proper AP door (building)
<br>
2. What is an area? ( and placing the AP)
<br>
3. The Hall of Mirrors (HOM) error
<br>
4. The Grey Door Problem. (Updated 4/19/98)
</p>

<h4>1. A proper AP door.</h4>
<p>
A proper AP door is a func_door surrounded on all sides by a frame (required because otherwise the entity touches the void causing a leak--this will be more clear in placement). The func_door then has a target of a func_areaportal. In fig. 1, you can see the frame brushes outlined in white (filled gray). The outline of the func_door is in yellow. The func_areaportal can be seen in fuscia. In my
working with APs, I've found it actually is OK to allow the areaportal to touch the void.
</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/ap0.gif" width="297" height="209" alt="ap0.gif (2896 bytes)"></center></p>

<h4>2. What is an area?</h4>

<p>
An areaportal door needs to be sandwiched between two different areas. Like a slice of cheese between bread. In fig. 2 below, you can see where I've drawn two rooms, and a room and a hallway--I've also drawn the entire AP entity in yellow (func_door and func_areaportal). The door must be BETWEEN, and NOT IN, any of the rooms involved, or hallways (henceforth, areas)--and each area, must be sealed with no leaks or openings, or the area must be terminated by another AP.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, the two rooms can touch the door entity.  Sometimes it cannot. Why? I can't tell you, suffice it to say, try pushing the two areas together until
they touch the AP door and its frame. If this causes problems, you might need to extend the frame to meet the two areas. Usually the first way does work, so read on to see if you have other problems before changing this, as changing frame size is usually a minor problem.
</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/ap1.gif" width="353" height="319" alt="ap1.gif (3115 bytes)"></center></p>

<p>
Ah hah... there's more. The above fig. 2 is an easy example to see two completely seperate areas. In fig 3. below, there is a room within a room. A common configuration of an outdoor room, or a room within a room. You might think that the two areas here are completely seperate. Quite WRONG. The problem lies in the inner room (red arrow). It's not seperate. It has the same floor and ceiling
(and if it didn't it wouldn't matter--it's not enough of a difference. The problem
is actually the walls.</p>

<p>While not entirely incorrect, this configuration may work as is, albeit with some trouble. Seperating the ceiling and floors of the inner room and making them different brushes of the outer room might work, but not if you need another entrance to
the inner room, other than teleporters.</p>

<p><center><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/ap2.gif" width="420" height="321"
alt="ap2.gif (3320 bytes)"></center></p>

<p>Here is how to correctly build this type of room for an AP (fig. 4 below). Different walls, different ceilings, and so on (different floors and ceilings, green and blue). Trust me.. If you don't build your rooms like this, you're gonna rebuild them later.</p>

<p><center><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/ap3.gif" width="397" height="363" alt="ap3.gif (4874 bytes)"></center></p>

<p>Okay.. you say.. I get it, I get it.. But do you? Do you know WHY? Here's
the answer:</p>

<p>1. An area is a completely sealed room (or container if you will) from which, all of
it's interior faces can ONLY be seen from within that area.</p>

<p>2. An area is a completely sealed room from which all of it's exterior faces, can only
be seen by the void (or nothing).</p>

<p>This of course doesn't include looking through where doors would be.</p>

<p>Below, you will find two examples, based on my map "Atmospheric Processor" (terraform2.bsp). I discovered in fig.5 below, my APs weren't working, yet I followed all the other tutorials (obviously). It ultimately came down to "What is an area?" The red outlined brushes represent sky, so this is an outdoor area. The above examples of a room in a room, are basically the box at the bottom of
the figure, with the tower on top. Most of the brushes, more or less were very similar to what you see here. Large, solid brushes. They broke rule 2. above. BSP did not see them as entirely seperate areas (in the tower and outside the tower), even though both ends of the openings (as seen) are terminated with APs.</p>

<p><center><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/apt1.gif" width="442" height="380" alt="apt1.gif (6296 bytes)"></center></p>

<p>What I had to do is add a small room within the opening (actually I wound up rebuilding the entire tower to learn this--so do what you need to do). I basically wound up with an inner-lower room, and inner-tower room (both connected). The large outer room, was made of the "skybox" and floor room, and the outer shell of the tower, and outer shell
of the lower room (outer shell or lower room not shown below).</p>

<p><center><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/apt2.gif" width="418" height="386" alt="apt2.gif (7594 bytes)"></center></p>

<h4>3. The Hall of Mirrors Effect (HOM)</h4>

<p>The Hall of Mirrors Effect is an error caused by an areaportal, which causes an area of the map to constantly display the contents of the screen without clearing. It's sort of like giant smudging, and sort of cool lookin I suppose, but.. still.. it's an error to be killed. What causes it? I don't know... But usually, it's not a bad areaportal. HOM usually appears after adding two or more APs to your map and usually it's because they connect the same areas... Can I help you fix it? Maybe.. Here's what I recommend. In the figure below, you will see the typical OK-side, and HOM-side. On the HOM-side you need to make the opening smaller (as
indicated by the red arrows). I'm talking about 2 grid points (pixels) here folks.. If you chose the right textures, you may not even have to realign them.</p>

<p>If you have HOM on BOTH sides of a door, then you have the problem on more than one areaportal. Do the above steps to each areaportal to see if this fixes it. If none of this works for you, I've usually found that having very symmetrical rooms (or groups of rooms) are the cause of this error (but not always), so try repositioning where the door is.</p>

<p><center><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/hom1.gif" width="374" height="253" alt="hom1.gif (5170 bytes)"></center></p>

<h4>4. The Grey Door Problem</h4>

<p><i>NOTE: I knew I'd figure this out after emailing J. Carmack and all the level designers at Id, and before getting a response... ARGH.</i></p>
<p>I've usually found the grey door problem when testing my level in software mode. Hardware accelerated graphics boards (3Dfx, Permedia2) don't usually show the problem. I have found that this happens under two possible conditions.  Check your areaportals by the numbered list below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be sure your areaportal has the <b>Clip</b> texture on <b>ALL</b> sides, or, you can use the <b>trigger</b> texture.<br>
<b>NOT</b> the Skip, Hint, or other textures. 
<br>
</li>
<li>Make sure the texture properties (again on <b>ALL</b> sides) have<br>
NoDraw <b>ON</b>, PlayerClip <b>OFF</b>, and MonsterClip <b>OFF</b>!<br><br>
<i>Try compiling at this point.</i><br><br>
</li>
<li>If you still have the grey areaportal, check to see if the frame<br>
of the door (you do have one right) completely touches the<br>
outer edges of the door.<br></li>
</ol>
<p>If the above doesn't work, then the area opposite the grey side may have too many
polygons to be drawn for software mode and this is just a result. You may have to remove the AP door, or change it to a regular door, and then perhaps use a U or L shaped hallway, or some other type of vis-blocker to make this part or your level work.</p>
<br><br>

<h4>Area Portals set for DM and Single Player</h4>

When using Area Portals in both DM and Single Player, you might find some problems.  In the typical single player game, doors are closed.  In DM most, if not all doors, are open.  You'll get the good ol' HOM.  Also, you won't get any errors related to areaportals and the number of areas they touch.
<br><br>
Sure you can take the cheap way (read, "easy") and make doors open real fast and close real fast (I personally like this, cause I don't think there is
any real place where doors are always open).  The hard way, is to have your DM areaportal doors not appear in deathmatch.  Sadly enough, I didn't have
an answer for the HOM portal problem.  Phil Daniels figured it out though, so he gets the credit for the info., cause I'd never have figured it out.
<br><br>
Most entities in most editors have spawnflags for whether they appear in single player, deathmatch, or under a particular difficulty level.  The
logical thing to do, would be to set the door to have a spawnflag "not in deathmatch" and the same for the areaportal (after all there is no more
door).  Nope.
<br><br>
The areaportals cannot be set this way.  They have to be operated, not flagged out (i.e. they will still be loaded).  Set a trigger_always targeted
to the ap's name and set it's spawnflags to "not in easy", "not in normal", and "not in hard".  The AP should have NO flags set, the door has "not in
deathmatch" set.
<br><br>
The level loads in DM and at load point, the areaportal is triggered (stays open) so there is no HOM.

	</blockquote>
	
<br><br><b>Why this tutorial?</b>

<p>Even with the recent .plan file posting from PlanetQuake's QuakeFinger server detailing how to use hint brushes, many people still find them difficult to understand. I therefore offer this "Tutorial" to help you learn how, where, when, and why to use them. 

<p>The difficulty in learning how to use hint brushes is complicated, mainly because one has to know how the bsp and vis utilities (or QBSP/QVIS) actually work. I may not be 100% correct here, but in some test maps, the effects desired were achieved by placing the hint brush according to the steps which will follow below. 

<p>Knowing how bsp works is the most important aspect of using hint brushes. Learning how bsp builds triangles out of your brushes can really only be done well if you have a FULL OpenGL implementation on your build machine. If you do, you can use "gl_showtris 1" in the console to have the Quake2 engine display the triangles. Unfortunately 3Dfx boards don't allow this. FireGL1000Pro's from Diamond work nicely, and are a decent 3D accel. for NT (Not as smooth as 3Dfx in games like GLQuake1/2). The FireGL1000Pro also doesn't show colored lighting (if they do, I'd like to know how to turn that on). 

<p>All of the figures below will be shown from the top-down view only. (Please note that bsp will often be more complicated in building triangles out of your brushes, and my example was drawn to keep it "clean" and understandable).

<p>Here is an example hallway between two areas (shown in later examples). Again, shown from the top-down view.

<p><b>Understanding BSP Created Triangles</b>

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/hint/hint_img2.gif"></div>

<p>When you run BSP (or QBSP3) the program goes through each brush and slices it into triangles. Some people refer to the triangles as polygons. I will use the term triangles, because that should remind you that, to my knowledge, Quake doesn't use 4-point polygons. 

<p>Here you can see the brushes (at least as far as top-down view is concerned) have been divided into triangles as shown by the yellow lines. 

<p><hr width=75% color=black noshade><p>

<p><b>Understanding How VIS Determines What to Draw</b>

<p>Here you can see we've added two areas in red, representing either more hallways, rooms, or any "container" in which the player can go or see. 

<p>Notice the green line of sight line (LOS) that I've drawn. It indicates how far you can see into the hallway and around its corner from Area 2. 

<p>Now say your player is at Point A. Since he is not past the green line, the Quake engine will not draw triangles of and within Area 2. Now say your player moves to Point B. Suddenly, the Quake engine will draw area 2--and you're still behind the LOS line! 

<p>The reason? Point C, which is on the SAME triangle as Point B, can see into Area 2. When VIS determines what can and can't be seen from a single triangle, it uses the vertexes (I assume ;).

<p><b>What a Hint Brush is and How to Place It</b>

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/hint/hint_img4.gif"></div>

<p>A hint brush, is a brush with the hint texture applied to all sides. Typically you make it as small as is manageable (about 8 units thick) and large enough to slice through the area you need to "split." 

<p>As shown in the diagram, the hint brush (in pink, or fuscia if you will), completely slices through the section of hallway. DO NOT USE CSG!!! You will create a leak if you do. The hint brush is not rendered, and is only used by VIS (more on that in part 4). 

<p>In this example, the hint brush has been placed almost to the line of sight and extends into the void through the hallway. 

<p><hr width=75% color=black noshade><p>

<p><b>What the Hint Brush Does</b>

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/hint/hint_img5.gif"></div>

<p>The hint brush forces QBSP to "break" brush triangles at the indicated points (see diagram), creating more triangles VIS can use to calculate with. 

<p>Now, when the player is at Point A or B, Area 2 is NOT drawn. When the player is at Point C, Area 2 IS drawn. Notice how in example 2, Area 2 is drawn for 50 percent of the hallway. The triangle in example 4, under Point C, is now about 25 percent as large as it was previously. 

<p>What this means is, you've added maybe 10-20 triangles but 80 percent of the hallway doesn't draw Area 2, saving you even more triangles from Area 2 being drawn. 

<p><hr width=75% color=black noshade><p>

<p><b>Final Notes</b>:

<p>You need to be careful adding hint brushes. If BSP had created triangles as in example 4, then you don't need to add a hint brush. The "break" is already there. Adding the hint brush in this case would simply increase the total number of triangles in the hallway, completely defeating it's purpose.

<p>Also, in order to accurately determine whether or not you need a hint brush in a specific place, you really need the gl_showtris option set to 1, and a full OpenGL implementation on your system.

<h3>The "angles" key/value pair</h3>

 <p>OK, this is a long story, but you goons are required to read the whole thing... 
	that's the price you pay for cool information. My 
	<a href="http://tarot.telefragged.com"> Tarot</a> teammate and spiritual advisor 
	Monsto Brukes wanted to simulate Q3 jump pads in Q2 for map testing purposes. 
	Tarot's bit_twiddling nerd guy (that's me) opened up the Q2 source and started to 
	plug in an elevation value. But wait... he found that trigger_push code refers to 
	the "angles" key... but that's not right he says... trigger_push just uses 
	"angle". Well it turns out id didn't trust you mapper goons to be able to do a 
	little simple trigonometry, so they published the input for trigger_push as 
	"angle" only, but the code does not have that limitation.</p>

 <p>The "angles" values are pitch (up/down), yaw (left/right) and roll (fall over). 
	If "angle" is specified for an entity, then the code automatically sets "angles" 
	to 0,angle,0... and these values are used for the entity. But what happens if 
	instead of specifying "angle" in the .map file, you set the three "angles"?... 
	heh heh... you know the answer, don't ya? And all it takes is a little math to 
	translate those angles into movement directions... but not to worry, Tarot's 
	bit_twiddling nerd has done that for you. The translations performed by the game 
	source end up making a positive pitch down from horizontal. Yaw is unaffected by 
	this, so you'd use the same angle you've previously used for the angle key. And 
	roll is ignored for trigger_push, which is a shame, really... it would be nice 
	to have a trigger_push that made you do flips. Anyhow... quick example, and I'm 
	sure you can take it from there. Say you want the trigger_push to push you up 60
	degrees from horizontal and to the west. Set "angles" to _60 180 0. That's it.</p>

 <p>So how do you go about using this info in your editor? If your editor allows you 
	to enter user_defined keys (qED, QERadiant, QuArk), you're all set. Just enter 
	"angles" for the key and "<_pitch> <yaw> 0" for the value. If you're using Tread, 
	open up quake2.gdf, find trigger_push, and enter the following below the "angle" 
	line:<br>
	<blockquote><pre>def_key : string : "angles" : "pitch yaw roll" : ""</pre></blockquote><!-- <br> -->
	If you're using WorldCraft, Mad Dog has already done the work for you... 
	<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~tonykat127/mapediting/fgd_q2.zip">get his new 
	.fgd file.</a> If you're using Qoole, stop. (ed. I’d have to agree.)</p>

 <p>One qualifier that could foul this up for you: If your editor forces an "angle" 
	key to be written to the .map file, "angles" will still work as long as it occurs 
	after the "angle" definition. So if you try this and you get the same old 
	trigger_push behavior, open up your .map file in a text editor, find the 
	trigger_push, and delete the "angle" line.<br>
	<br>
	The syntax for an 'angles' keyvalue is:<br>
	<blockquote><pre>"angles" "pitch yaw roll"</pre></blockquote><!-- <br> -->
	Pitch can be any number from _90 to 90; negative numbers "aim" up and positive 
	numbers "aim" down. Yaw can be virtually any positive number, generally 0_360 
	(this would be the same value one would typically use for 'angle'). Roll can be 
	any number from _180 to 180; this affects the "canted" view one can achieve with 
	an info_player_intermission. Depending on the entity, a "roll" value of anything 
	other than 0 can yield no result, an interesting result, or a result you want to 
	avoid.</p>
	
 <p>Some example entities by way of explanation:
	<ul type="square">
		<li><b>Ammo</b> - Ammo need not lie flat. If you want to put a box of ammo 
			on a tilted floor, or simulate an item amid a jumble of other debris you 
			can. Note that the bounding box of the ammo does not change position or 
			orientation, so you may need to work in a wedge_shaped mist brush in 
			there to get the visual effect just right. Giving values to all three 
			angles is fine.
			<br>&nbsp;
		<li><b>Player starts, deathmatch starts, teleporters</b> - DM spawn points 
			and teleporter/dest platforms can be canted just like ammo. However the 
			'angles' value translates into the direction the player looks when he 
			spawns. So if you want the player to spawn up on a high ledge, looking 
			down on the action, you could give the spawn point an 'angles' value of 
			"45 0 0", for example. Even if the player has freelook off and lookspring 
			on it works fine. I strongly advise against using a "roll" value of 
			anything other than 0, since the player gets stuck with the canted view. 
			Until he hits a teleporter dest which straightens him out anyway. Unless 
			of course you want to simulate drunkeness.
			<br>&nbsp;
		<li><b>Strogg ships, Vipers</b> - Simulate diving or launching ships. Or a 
			crashed misc_bigviper. Looks cool; use all 3 values. Advise the use of a 
			playerclip brush to avoid weird clipping problems with the misc_bigviper 
			model in the game.
			<br>&nbsp;
		<li><b>Banner</b> - All 3 values work, but the appearance is odd; so "roll" 
			has little value __ but a slight "pitch" effect could have its place I 
			suppose.
			<br>&nbsp;
		<li><b>Monsters</b> - Good for a laugh. Give a monster_soldier an 'angles' 
			keyvalue of "60 0 0" and he "swims" on the floor. Too bad monsters drown 
			in water. Death animations can be even funnier.
			<br>&nbsp;
		<li><b>Target_blasters</b> - Want a blaster that shoots up or down at an 
			angle? No problem. "Roll" values don't matter. Works with lasers too, if 
			you don't want to bother with an info_null. And it works with the 
			target_splash too.
			<br>&nbsp;
		<li><b>Doors and buttons</b> - This is very very cool. You can have
			multi_piece doors that move up/down at angles, and buttons that recess 
			properly into angled consoles. Figuring out 'lip' may be a problem; 
			I haven't experimented but I suspect that the game uses either a 
			horizontal or vertical orientation for calculating 'lip'; so I would
			avoid using _45 and 45 for "pitch", so you can get predictable results. 
			Again, "roll" doesn't matter.
			<br>&nbsp;
		<li><b>Weapons, keys, armor, etc</b> - Spinning crap seems to ignore 
			'angles'. Too bad.
	</ul>	
	Anyway these are some ideas. In order to use the 'angles' key properly in 
	Worldcraft, you should set 'angle' to '0'; this removes the 'angle' key from 
	the .map file. My .FGD prompts you for "pitch yaw roll" for entities which can 
	make use of "roll", and it prompts you for "pitch yaw 0" for entities which 
	can't.</p>
	
 <p>The team was so fired up about this that we built a fun DM map for you guys to 
	check out. We started out making a small tutorial sort of thing, but it got out 
	of hand pretty quickly and turned into the real deal: <br>

	Making ENV. Maps with Bryce 2 - <a href="mailto:m.christian@student.murdoch.edu.au">Murray "[PnC]Muzman" Christian</a>
</blockquote>

<br><br>

<p>Want to make environment maps for Quake2 that don't look cubic? Want to do it without spending ages touching up the corners of the individual sky pics? This tutorial is about how to do exactly that with Bryce 3d.<br><br>

If you don't know anything about Q2 skies/environment maps you should read Fishman's tutorial on the subject to get familiarised with the basics. In particular the different images and the file name system for different angles, the different file formats for different renderers (software and hardware) and how to set the sky into your map (I'm not a mapper, I can't tell you how to do that).<br><br>

The technique described in this tutorial was done using Bryce 3d and Photoshop 4; Bryce 3d for building the scene and Photoshop 4 to convert it into the format used by Quake2. Photoshop 4 isn't essential for this, any graphics program will do so long as it can resize images and convert them to different formats and colour modes  (the shareware version of Paintshop pro for example). This technique should also work with Bryce 2 no problem, but some of the functions I talk about might be in different places. I'm also assuming that people reading this are reasonably familiar with Bryce 2 or 3d; how it works, rendering etc. If you want some more detail on Bryce 2 scene building there's a list of sites at the bottom that will get you started (and  much more). <br><br>

Ok, the first and most important thing to do is create a Bryce 2/3d document for the env map and set up the document, the camera and the sky  for (pretend) spherical rendering.</b><br><br>

Go into the File menu and go into Document setup. Down the right hand side of the box that pops up there is a list of default aspect ratios; pick Square (this makes the aspect ratio 1:1 ie the top/bottom and side resolutions will be the same)<br><br>

Next put in a resolution. Anything will do so long as the aspect ratio stays square. Also, remember that the final pics will have a resolution of 256x256, Photoshop and the like reduce images best when proportions are nice and relative, so multiples of 256 will get the best results. I chose 512x512 because I run windows in 800x600 and it fits nicely on the screen.<br><br>

This is what it should look like (in case I'm making no sense)<br><br>

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/bryce2/bryce2_img1.jpg"></div>

<p><hr width=75% color=black noshade><p>

<p><b>Next, the camera</b>

<p>Select a view other than the camera's view and select the camera itself. Go into the camera attributes (the little "A" seen right).

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/bryce2/bryce2_img2.jpg"></div>

<p>Set all the rotation axis' to zero. Set all the position axis' to zero except the y axis. This is the height of the camera  off the "ground". How high you put it is up to you, it depends on the sky you want and how it is meant to fit into the map. For example; I did a suburban sky and I wanted it to look like the ground and the players head/viewing height were in proportion, so setting y to 4 turned out to be the best. Over all there is not much need to go over 10 for this setting. Set the field of view (FOV) to 90 degrees. Set the viewing scale to 72 percent. These two settings are vital to making the finished product blend together, removing any "corners" from the sky.  Once set, do not change them. (In case you're wondering, it means that only 72 percent of the actual FOV is at 90 degrees. The rest is dragged in from 'outside' to fill the view, distorting things slightly. It's similar to increasing the FOV in Quake2; since you can't change the size of your monitor things get distorted. Confusing; hard to explain; but it works.) After all that the camera settings should look like this (with important stuff underlined in red)

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/bryce2/bryce2_img3.jpg"></div>

<p><hr width=75% color=black noshade><p>

<p><b>Now, the one and only sky setting</b>

<p>Go into the Sky&Fog section and pull down the options, choosing  Edit Sky/Fog

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/bryce2/bryce2_img4.jpg"></div>

<p>In there, make sure that the option 'Link sun to view' is turned off /not ticked. This is very important as it makes the sun stay put when rotating the camera (which we will be doing later), otherwise, as the name suggests, the sun will re-align in relation to the camera position. This option might be somewhere different in Bryce2, just remember to find it and turn it off or the whole effect will be lost.

<p><hr width=75% color=black noshade><p>

<p><b>Now the document is ready for the render sequence</b>

<p>Go ahead and build the scene, with the camera as the centre. You might want to do something simple to start with, like an infinite water plane and one of the preset cloud and sun arrangements, just to try it out.<br><br>

Once the scene is finished it's time to do the final render of the six images that make up the Q2 sky.  If the camera has been moved while doing the scene make sure it's returned to the position described above before you render using the following instructions.<br><br>

The camera is going to be turning right and up and down; doing this involves changing the x and y rotation axis' in the camera attributes (see the camera settings picture back up the page a bit).<br><br>

First render the scene (through the camera view) with x, y and z rotation at zero.  Then export the image (give it an obvious name with a 1 at the end). Five more to go.  Follow this sequence of camera rotations to get the rest.<br><br>

<blockquote>
	x= 0 y= 90 z= 0.  Render.  Export the image, named as the second in the series<br>
	(NOTE: Bryce will replace the rotation angles with negative numbers sometimes. Just delete them and put in the ones given here as you change them.)<br><br>

	x= 90 y= 90 z= 0. Render. Export the image, named as the third in the series.<br>
	x= 0 y= 180 z= 0. Render. Export the image, named as the fourth in the series<br>
	x= 0 y= 270 z= 0. Render. Expert the image, named as the fifth in the series.<br>
	x= 270 y= 270 z= 0. Render. Export image, named  as the sixth in the series.
</blockquote>

If everything went according to plan the last render should have been the camera pointing straight up.  And now you have six images which make up a cube.

<p><hr width=75% color=black noshade><p>

<p><b>Next up, the six images must be converted to Quake2's formats</b>

<p>Load them all into your graphics program and shrink them all to 256x256 pixels. Then change them to the appropriate file name (remember those little tags on the end for each face) and save them in .tga format. The filenames for the six pictures are as follows:

<blockquote>				
	image 1: back (bk)<br>	
	image 2: right (rt)<br>	
	image 3: down (dn)<br>	
	image 4: front (ft)<br>	
	image 5: left (lf)<br>	
	image 6: up (up)<br>	
</blockquote>

Then things get tricky, converting to 256 colours for the .pcx versions can have…….questionable results.  It depends on the colours in the original image and how close they are to colours in the Quake2 palette. Techniques on how to convert can be found all over the web, I used the one I found in the "tutorials" section of <a href="http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~jchin/skins/skins.htm" target="_top">this</a> page. This site describes both Paintshop and Photoshop conversion techniques for skins, but works great for skies as well. It gets around the differences that Photoshop and Quake2 have for the pcx format nicely.<br><br>

However, after conversion some serious touching up might be needed to get the most out of the format. (Photoshop dithering can be really bad, depending on the sky. Experiment a bit.)<br><br>

For an example check out the env map from the second of the awesome Falhaven ctf maps by Lance S. Winkel (<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/dl/dl.asp?captured/ctf2review/falhavn2.zip" target="_top">here</a>). The difference between the gl and sofware versions is vast, but necessary to keep the effect.<br><br>

Anyway, by now you should have a sky to try out on your map. For more map specific skies the orientation might have to be changed, just rotate the file names of the side images and rotate the actual up and down images to suit (a tip: the front -ft- image of the sky always joins to the right side of the up and down images). Or better yet, find out which way the sky sits in the map and build the sky to suit it.<br><br>

Good Luck! And mail me with any major questions (or better ways to do it)<br><br>

by Chris "Kold" Stringer</center>
<p class="q2bg1">Quake II has long been a game with many things we wanted but couldn't always have. <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/j-spot/jbuzz.html">Jester</a>, a fellow mapper recently made this deathmatch map and despite the amazing brush &amp; texture work .. one thing that caught my attention was the rain, now although quake II doesn't support such a feature without a engine mod, there's several ways to make it with one of them being animated (or flowing) textures if you will.<br><br>
<span class="note"><b>IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION:</b> There's one flaw to making the rain in this tutorial and that's the <a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/book/view/53">r_speeds</a>, you'll notice a massive difference in fps .. that noted don't use this affect too much in your map or it will be unplayable in the online arena's.</span></p>
<hr noshade width="75%" align="center">
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<p class="q2bg1">Before you start this tutorial, in order for the rain to work you'll need a graphics card with the latest opengl driver's installed as the affect's of the texture/rain rapidly disappear in software mode as explained in this <a href="http://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.gamedesign.net/node/54">tutorial</a>.<br><br>You'll also need the <a href="http://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.gamedesign.net/content/quake2/tutorials/make_rain/rainb.wal">rain texture</a> and the <a href="http://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.gamedesign.net/content/quake2/tutorials/make_rain/raintut.zip">example map</a> I'm using in this tutorial (the rain texture is in the .zip with the example map)<br><br>In the editor, work with the grid settings on "16" as that's what I'm using in this tutorial.<br><br>phew ! With keeping all the above in mind, in this tutorial i'll show you a fast and affective way to make some convincing looking rain in no time!</p> 

<hr noshade width="75%" align="center">

<h3>Step 1: Make a Small Room</h3>
<center><img border="0" width="450" src="content/quake2/tutorials/make_rain/koldtut2.jpg"><br>
"TOP" View in QuArK</center><br><br>
<center><img border="0" width="450" src="content/quake2/tutorials/make_rain/koldtut1.jpg"><br>
in game shot</center><br><br>

<p>Firstly make a small room as shown above, then add a info_player_start in there along with some light fixtures to give us some light. I'm using Quark's default room for this tutorial so most of this should be already done for you . </p> 

<hr noshade width="75%" align="center">

<h3>Step 2: Adding the Rain Texture</h3>
<center><img border="0" width="450" src="content/quake2/tutorials/make_rain/koldtut3.jpg"></center><br><br>

<p>Next we'll add the rain texture into the map you just created , in the screenshot in step 1 there's a opening in the roof , make 1 brush for a start to fit between the sky brush and the floor ( click the image above on the left for a closer look )</p>

<center><img border="0" width="450" src="content/quake2/tutorials/make_rain/koldtut4.jpg"></center><br><br>

<p>Then rotate the texture if its facing the wrong way to look like the picture above, the flag settings should already be set with the texture but if they aren't add the following to each face <i>mist</i>, <i>current_dn</i>, <i>trans33</i> and <i>flowing</i>.</p>

<center><img border="0" width="450" src="content/quake2/tutorials/make_rain/koldtut5.jpg"><br>
The applied rain texture</center><br><br>

<p><b>Important:</b> Sometimes your rain may be flowing upwards ;o), if it is then just rotate the texture on that certain face in till it starts going the right way.</p>

<center><img border="0" width="450" src="content/quake2/tutorials/make_rain/koldtut6.jpg"><br>
the 5 brushes spread apart</center><br><br>

<p>Next, copy the brush you just made into 5 copy's , randomly move them around the gap in your roof as shown with the image above on the right, they don't have to be exactjust roughly but keeping them inline with the sky and the floor brushes as you did with the first brush. I spread mine apart to give the rain a better look.</p>

<center><img border="0" width="450" src="content/quake2/tutorials/make_rain/koldtut7.jpg"><br>
click for a bigger view</center><br><br>
 
<p>There's different ways you can tweak the affect I've just shown you like stretching the rain texture a little longer to give it a faster looking affect</p>

<br><br>

<p>Something that's always been missing from Quake 2 is the ability to have "holes" in a texture. Half-life was one of the first games to properly implement "holes". Some examples of this are: see-through, shoot-through railings made from a single brush, see-through grating for floors. Well it is possible to do the same in Quake 2. While Quake 2's Partial Texture Transparency is not perfect, when used intelligently, it is a simple and effective way of adding detail without adding many faces.

<br><br><b>Image of the web texture before and after:</b>

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/pttrans/pttrans_img1a.jpg"> <img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/pttrans/pttrans_img1b.jpg"></div>

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/pttrans/pttrans_img2.jpg"></div>

<p>The first step in the process is preparing the texture; punching the "holes" in it. Any part of the texture that will be invisible must be coloured with Quake 2's transparency colour (Red: 159, Green: 91, Blue: 83). In our examples all the black spaces in the cobweb are replaced with the transparency colour.

<p>Once you've got you texture prepared, it is only a matter of applying the texture to a brush and setting the proper flags. In all cases either trans_33 or trans_66 will be checked (usually trans_66 as trans_33 makes the visible parts of the texture very noticably translucent) as this is what does the magic. This flag must be applied to all faces of the brush. All other flags are completely optional as with any other brush. 

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/pttrans/pttrans_img3.jpg"><br>Image of the web texture without trans_66 checked.</div>

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/pttrans/pttrans_img4.jpg"><br>Image of the web with trans_66 checked, the web texture is applied on all faces.</div>

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/pttrans/pttrans_img5.jpg"><br>Image of the web with a totally clear texture, and the web texture applied to one face (the "correct" way).</div>

<p>When making a fence-like brush, you will only want to have 1 face of the brush visible. One way would be to make a completely transparent texture to apply to all faces but one. This would be the "proper" way to do it. But there is also another trick which may come in handy as well as decreasing the translucency of the visible fence. Create the fence as a 1 unit thick brush. Keep the fence texture applied to both sides of the brush. If the brush is any thicker than 1 unit the double effect can become quite noticeable, but at 1 unit apart the player has to be very close to notice the effect.

You can clearly see the double effect. The fence on the right is only 1 unit thick, making the double effect disappear, and also reducing the translucency.</div>
</blockquote>

<p>One disadvantage of this technique is that it cannot be used in software mode:

<p><div align="center"><a href="/content/quake2/tutorials/pttrans/pttrans_img7.jpg"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/pttrans/pttrans_img7_sm.jpg" border=0></a></div>

	<b>Things to remember when using this technique:</b><br>
        <li>This does not work in software rendering mode.
        <li>The visible parts of the texture will always be translucent which makes thinner visible areas preferable (example: a wire fence). 
        <li>Translucency can be reduced by making the brush 1 unit thick with two exact visible sides overlapping eachother. 
        <li>Placing the transparent brush partially out of range of the player will reduce the chances of any translucency/double effect being noticed. 
        <li>Colour for transparency is: Red: 159, Green: 91, Blue: 83. 
        <li>Detail added this way does not produce high r_speeds. 
        <li>Only works with trans_33 or trans_66 applied to all faces. 
        <li>Wherever the transparent brushes intersect other brushes, a faint red glow appears.<br>

	<a name="introduction"></a><b>Introduction</b><br>
	<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to describe several simple techniques you can use in your Quake2 maps to reduce the number of polygons seen by the game engine, thereby increasing the performance of your map and improving gameplay. None of the techniques described here are difficult to implement, and will usually not result in any undesirable tradeoffs, i.e. reduced visual quality. This tutorial does <b>not</b> discuss hint brushes, which, like the techniques discussed here, are often used to influence the way qbsp3 partitions brushes. Proper use of hint brushes is a difficult technique to master, and, unlike the methods discussed here, generally requires a trial-and-error approach to achieve the desired results. NOTE: Don't even think about using hint brushes unless you are able to run &quot;gl_showtris 1&quot; (see below). It's just about impossible to know how to use hint brushes to block off areas when you don't know what the engine can/cannot see from a view. For more information on the use of hint brushes, see Steven Boswell's excellent article, <a href="/content/quake2/tutorials/poly_count/bspvis.htm">qbsp3, qvis3, and map-making</a>.<br><br>

	<p>The authors assume that the reader has some experience at creating maps for Quake2. This is not meant to be a primer on map editing, and we assume that the reader has prior knowledge of why reducing polygon counts is important. For basic information on creating Quake2 maps and map-related issues, read through the <a href="http://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.gamedesign.net/node/42">Tutorials</a>, <a href="http://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.gamedesign.net/node/21">Entity Properties</a>, and <a href="http://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.gamedesign.net/node/17">FAQ</a> sections at Rust. <br><br>

	<p><br><hr color=black noshade width=75%><br><p>

	<a name="examples"></a><b>Example maps</b><br>
	<p>This tutorial is accompanied by an example map that demonstrates most of the techniques mentioned here. To get the most out of this tutorial you should print this document and refer to it as you navigate through the rooms in the examples. The example map is available <a href="/content/quake2/tutorials/poly_count/poly_count.zip">here</a>. Two files are included - a standard .map file that you can import into most Quake2 editors, and a compiled bsp. Unzip tricks.zip to your quake2\baseq2\maps directory. To see the results achieved by the methods used in the examples, you should run the map with <b>r_speeds 1</b> and, if available to you, <b>gl_showtris 1</b>. Either start the map with a command line similar to:<br><br>

	<b>\quake2\quake2.exe +set r_speeds 1 +set gl_showtris 1 +map tricks</b><br><br>
 
	or start Quake2, bring up the console(press the '~' key), and type:<br><br>
   
	<b>r_speeds 1;gl_showtris 1;map tricks</b><br><br>

	<b>NOTE:</b> All of the example maps are very simple, and so the polygon counts are reasonably low with or without the methods described in this tutorial. Likewise, the reductions in polygon counts achieved by the methods described here are not very significant in the context of the examples. However, these methods <b>will</b> produce significant performance increases when used together in a large, detailed map.<br><br>
    
	<p>GL_Showtris draws white lines around all of the polygons in view of the game engine. This allows you to see how your brushes are broken up in a level, and also shows you what polygons the engine sees that you might have thought were sufficiently isolated that they would not be in view. If you have a 3dfx card, you will first need to download the <b>Mesa OpenGL drivers</b> from <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/7220/mesa.html">Phil Frisbie's Programming Page</a>. These drivers will allow you to use the Default OpenGL video mode with your 3dfx card, which in turn allows you to use gl_showtris. Framerates will be only slightly slower than with the normal 3dfx setting.<br><br>


	<br><br><center><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/poly_count/poly_count1.jpg"><br>Screenshot from a level you're probably familiar with, with gl_showtris turned on.</center><br><br>
    
	<p>R_Speeds displays several numbers of interest to map authors. The format of this report is dependent on what type of rendering you are using. With software rendering, r_speeds will display something like:<br><br>
    
        <b>33 ms 250/220/30
        poly 0 surf</b><br><br>
    
	The first number indicates the time, in milliseconds, required for one game cycle. Your framerate in frames/sec is 1000 divided by this number. The second number indicates how many polygons are in view, the third number shows how many polygons are drawn, and the fourth entry is the number of polygons in view but not drawn. For our purposes, the <b>second</b> number (polygons in view) is what we are trying to reduce.<br><br>

	With 3D accelerators, the r_speeds display will look something like:<br><br>
    
        <p><b>250 wpoly 450 epoly 3 tex 2 lmaps</b><br><br>

	&quot;wpoly&quot; is the number of world polygons in view and &quot;epoly&quot; is the number of entity polygons. Although you also need to monitor &quot;epoly&quot;, this tutorial concentrates on the <b>wpoly</b>entry.<br><br>

	<a name="tricks"></a><h3>The Tricks</h3><br>

<a name="cut1024"></a><b>Awareness of qbsp3's default cuts</b><br>The original id-supplied qbsp3 (and most other qbsp3's) initially divides your map into 1024x1024x8192 sections. This procedure can produce unwanted brush cuts unless you arrange your map to minimize these effects. Steven Boswell has produced a version of qbsp3 which does <b>not</b> divide your map up in this way (available <a href="http://yyz.com/~whatis/Quake2/bspvis.html">here</a>), but this can often produce &quot;Subdivide face: didn't split the polygon&quot; errors. In the first room of the example map, the inside face of the wall to the player's left is at x=-16. This causes qbsp3 to break the 4 adjoining surfaces (floor, ceiling, and adjacent walls) along the line x=0. <b><i>Any brush which intersects a line at x or y equal to a multiple of 1024 will be divided in this way</i></b>. (Since the sections used are 8192 units tall, and the maximum extents of a map are +/-4096 units in any direction, you don't have to worry about these cuts on the z axis.) The solution here is obvious: move the entire room (or only this one wall) 16 units in the +x direction, and these cuts are no longer made (Actually they are made, but no longer result in additional polygons). Of course if your room is larger than 1024 units in either the x or y direction, at least one of these cuts will still be made. However, you can minimize the effects of these cuts by careful arrangement of your brushes. For example, if you have a crate with one face at x=1022, move it over 2 units so that this face is at x=1024. This method can very easily decrease your polygon count by 50 or more in a room with many details.<br><br>

	<p><br><hr color=black noshade width=75%><br><p>

	 <p><a name="func_wall"></a><b>Alternative uses of func_wall</b><br> 
	 The second set of examples shows a room with 6 columns that span from floor to ceiling. The intersection of the columns with the horizontal floor and ceiling surfaces causes the horizontal faces to be broken up more than they would be if the columns were not present. In the next room, these columns are made into a func_wall. Since entities (including func_walls) do not influence the way qbsp3 breaks up your world brushes, the floor and ceiling are partitioned as they would be if the columns were not present at all.<br><br>

	 There are several limitations to using this method:
	 <ol>
		<li>The lighting quality of your func_wall will usually not be as good (though it is hard to see a difference in the example). Extra effort would usually be required to correct this.
		<li>Entities do not block light or, put another way, cast shadows. You can see this effect in the screenshots from the example map below.</li>
		<li>You cannot have more than 256 total models in any one map, and each func_wall counts against the total. If you exceed this limitation, you will get a game-crashing Index Overflow error. For more information on this subject, see <a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/eio.html">this tutorial</a>. You <b>can</b> include multiple non-contiguous brushes in the same func_wall (as has been done in the example), <b>but:</b>
		<li>You should never allow a func_wall to span across areas that are not seen by the engine at the same time. For example, it might be tempting to include many brushes throughout your map into the same func_wall, like on opposite sides of an areaportal, to prevent Index Overflow errors. However, this practice will at a minimum cause visual errors in your func_walls.
		<li>You should <i>never</i> make a wall/floor/ceiling which &quot;touches&quot; the void an entity; otherwise, your map will leak!
	 </ol>

	<p><br><hr color=black noshade width=75%><br><p>

	<p><a name="embedlites"></a><b>Embedded light fixtures</b><br>
	<p>It's very easy to slap several of the 16x16 light fixture textures against your ceiling, walls, or floors to light a room. However, the 4 edges adjacent to the lit surface are visible, and will be divided up into 2 polygons each. You can embed your light fixtures in your ceiling/walls/floor such that the sides of the fixture aren't visible. This method generally results in a decrease of 8 polygons/fixture. Of course, this method is quite a bit more trouble, as you will also have to divide your ceiling/walls/floor up carefully. For best results, you could place the fixtures such that the edges are all at multiples of the texture dimensions, as well as making sure they line up with each other. This not only allows you to forego texture alignment hassles, but will also produce fewer brush cuts than if your fixtures are placed at random locations. <p>This method is applicable to other textures, of course. For example, &quot;exit&quot; signs, etc. and texture blending can use this method to decrease the number of brush cuts.<br><br>
    
	If you <b>want</b> the edges of the fixtures visible, such that it is apparent that the fixtures stand out from the mounting surface, consider moving the fixtures 1 unit from the surface such that the two brushes don't touch. (This technique is described <a href="/node/53/#gaps">below</a>). This method will not be as effective as embedding the fixtures, but <b>will</b>produce a lower polygon count than placing the fixtures flush against your ceiling/walls/floor.<br><br>

	<p><br><hr color=black noshade width=75%><br><p>

	<a name="donut"></a><b>Doughnut hallway</b><br> 
	The doughnut hallway is the only method presented here that significantly alters the appearance of your map. If you have adjacent rooms connected by a short hallway, but don't want to separate the rooms with a door and func_areaportal, the doughnut hallway is ideal for blocking visibility from one room to the next. This method was used extensively in Quake1, since it lacked func_areaportals to block vis from one room to another. It's popularly known as the &quot;Donut Trick&quot;, and is as viable a technique for Quake2 as it was for Quake1.<br><br>

	The key to the success of the doughnut hallway is to size the vis-blocking wall such that the player (and the engine) cannot see from one hallway entrance to the opposite side of the wall. This wall should extend from the floor to the ceiling, and both the floor and ceiling of the hallway must be constructed with solid non-transparent textures. Naturally, making this wall an entity in whole or in part would defeat efforts at blocking polygons from view.<br><br>

	<center><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/poly_count/poly_count4.gif"><br>Doughnut hallway</center><br><br>
    
	<p>A similar result can be achieved in a large open space if a huge monolithic structure is placed so it blocks the view from one side of the area to the other. Naturally this would require experimentation to get just right for each specific open area where you might want to use this method. Of course you may only make things worse if your vis-blocking structure is not quite so monolithic, and its own polys added to the mix outnumbers the polys that it blocks.<br><br>

	<p><br><hr color=black noshade width=75%><br><p>

	<a name="evil"></a><b>Brush subtraction is evil</b><br>
	Well, OK, not really. But brush subtraction (or carving, hollowing, CSG subtraction) is generally the most abused feature of any map editor. The time savings you achieve with brush subtraction are very often more than offset by the time required to fix brush subtraction errors. At best what you're liable to get is a mess that is painful to look at and read in your editor. The example map shows a set of 3 arched doorways constructed with brush subtraction. In this case, small roundoff errors have resulted in several very noticeable gaps between brushes, and higher than necessary polygon counts. In the next room, the identical arched doorways have been created by manual placement of the brushes that form the arches. <b>NOTE:</b> Even if your editor does not have roundoff problems and you very carefully perform the subtraction operation with the cutting brush aligned to the grid and do everything else correctly, this example shows an obvious problem with using brush subtraction with a non-square cutting brush on a large wall - say you've constructed your arches, but then decide you want to move one arch over by 4 units - good luck. Well, take the opportunity then to pat yourself on the back for all the time you saved performing brush subtraction in the first place, because you're going to be using that time now.<br><br>
   
	<center><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/poly_count/poly_count5.gif"></center><br><br>

	<p>If you insist on using brush subtraction for some odd masochistic reason for this type of operation, you will do <b>much less</b> damage in this case by isolating the area that is affected to the smallest possible one.<br><br>

	<center><img border="0" width="450"  src="/content/quake2/tutorials/poly_count/poly_count6.gif"></center><br><br>

	<p>In this example, the cylindrical top of the arch is subtracted from the smallest possible cube. The result of this operation is then copied to the other arch locations. This results in much simpler (and more importantly much easier to edit) brushes.<br><br>

	<p><br><hr color=black noshade width=75%><br><p>

	<a name="gaps"></a><b>Gaps between brushes</b><br>
	Brushes will <b>always</b> be split where they intersect other brushes. To get rid of this effect, you can move small objects away from the other brush by 1 unit so that they do not touch. If this trick is used with discretion this small gap will not be visible to the player. This technique is typically best used in areas where the player isn't going to notice differences in shadowing -- such as the ceiling or on the upper edges of walls. You can also use this technique on non-breakable windows to lower your polygon count (it won't help to use this method on breakable windows -- since they are entities they will not break up the window frame anyway). The lighting will be fine, but you should use this method with discretion if the player can get very close to the window - the gap will almost always be visible from close range. Floors are typically the worst place to try to implement this feature (as shown below), unless they're in a very well lit area with offsetting lights where shadows won't be dramatic.<br><br>

	<center><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/poly_count/poly_count7.jpg"><br>The crate in this example is 1 unit from the floor. Notice that the resulting shadows give the crate the appearance of being suspended several units above the floor.</center><br><br>
         
	<p>In the example map, the roof of the test room is open to the sky with many criss-crossing roof beams. These beams result in the faces making up the walls of the room being broken up much more than they would be if the beams were not present. In the following room, these beams have been shortened by 2 units such that neither end touches a wall. Even in this relatively simple room, this method results in a polygon reduction of about 30. The lighting in this room is such that the gap is not visible at all, so there is no visual problem in this case.<br><br>

	<center><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/poly_count/poly_count8.jpg"><br>Beams touch the wall. Notice how the wall is split up by qbsp3</center><br><br>

	<center><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/poly_count/poly_count9.jpg"><br>Ends of beams are 1 unit away from wall</center><br><br>
	
	<p><b>NOTE: This method should </b><i>never</i> be used on brushes that would otherwise block visibility from one area to another. For example, creating 1-unit gaps at the tops and bottoms of vis-blocking walls is a pretty silly thing to do.</b><br><br>

	<p><br><hr color=black noshade width=75%><br><p>
    
	<a name="detail"></a><b>Detail brushes</b><br>
	You have probably seen warnings that the use of detail brushes will result in higher r_speeds. While <b><i>sometimes</i></b> true, the only way to know for certain whether the use of detail brushes will increase, decrease, or have no effect on r_speeds is to test it and measure the results. Detail brushes are usually recommended as a method for speeding up a lengthy vis, since they are not included in vis calculations. Qbsp3 will <b>not</b> use the planes of detail brushes to split your map, so <b><i>sometimes</i></b> the use of detail brushes will <b><i>decrease</i></b> the number of polygons in your map - this is what we want.<br><br>

	Detail brushes can generally safely be used on any object which does little or nothing to block visibility. If restricted to small objects which don't block the view of other objects, the use of detail brushes <b><i>usually</i></b> does not cause an increase in r_speeds. And in fact, in the 3rd roof beam example detail brushes actually <b>improve</b> r_speeds since the planes of the beams are no longer used to split up the map.<br><br>
	
	<center><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/poly_count/poly_count10.jpg"><br>Beams are detail brushes. Contrast this screenshot with those above. Note that the planes of the beams are no longer selected as bsp splitters.</center><br><br>

	<p><b>NOTE: Detail brushes are designed to be used on brushes that do not block the player's view. You should <i>never</i> make a wall/floor/ceiling which &quot;touches&quot; the void a detail brush; otherwise, your map will leak!</b><br><br>

	<p><a name="miter"></a><b>Mitered corners</b><br>
	Some may think this method is generally best reserved for times when you are truly desperate to lower your polygon counts. While the return on your investment is usually small, and can be quite a bit of trouble (particularly if your editor does not support vertex manipulation - a glaring omission), in general this can be a good technique on general principles. In the example map, one room contains two open-ended concrete boxes that are constructed from normal cube brushes. The next room shows these same concrete boxes constructed with mitered brushes. This technique will generally result in lower polygon counts in any location where the <b>outside</b> corner of the intersection of two brushes is visible.<br><br>

	<p><a name="textures"><b>Let the textures do the work</b><br>
	This is primarily intended for all of you engineers and architects and wannabe's out there - you know who we're talking about. It may be very tempting to try to mimic a real environment with brushes as much as possible, down to the smallest details. However, this practice will very often produce a completely beautiful, but unplayable map. If architectural details aren't critical to gameplay, consider simplifying your level by <b>simulating details with textures</b>. If a stock-Q2 texture does not exist that will accomplish what you want, make your own! There are several excellent tools available for creating custom textures (<a href="http://www.telefragged.com/wally/">Wally</a>, for example).<br><br>

	<p>Here's a sobering thought for those wishing to include custom textures (or sounds, models or custom anything for that matter) with multiplayer maps: An online server will seldom run such a map, for the simple reason that it is unlikely that all players connecting to that server will have the necessary files themselves. Other players who make their own maps as you do will have the Quake2 textures extracted for compiling purposes, and they may be loath to &quot;pollute&quot; their textures directory with new ones which will only make selecting textures for their own maps confusing. Additionally, if such a map has to be run from a custom &quot;game&quot; directory, it would be even more unlikely an online server would run it, unless your map is part of a mod which the server is running. Keep in mind also that it is not possible to run 2 &quot;game&quot; directories simultaneously, so maps run from custom directories cannot be used with bots. Custom files are probably best suited to single-player maps.<br><br>

	<p><a name="threesides"></a><b>3 Sides rather than 4</b><br>
	This one will seem obvious after you try it. If you have four-sided brushes in a spot where the player cannot get to the far side, use a 3-sided brush instead. Depending on the architecture of your map, this simple change can result in a significant decrease in your polygon count. In the example map, two barred windows are placed in the two test rooms. In the first room, the bars are regular square brushes; in the second room, triangular brushes are used with the point of the triangle facing away from the player. Even up close it is hard to tell that these brushes aren't 4-sided, but the peak polygon count drops by more than 50 with this simple change. This method will likely produce similar results with jail cells and any type of grate.<br><br>

	<p><a name="opaque"><b>Transparent vs. opaque water</b><br>
	Transparent water is cool, but of course does nothing to block visibility. If you have water brushes in a high-poly area of your map, consider turning off the TRANS33 or TRANS66 flags, which will make the water opaque (or use a non-transparent water texture). The water is still transparent on the inside, but will act like a normal solid brush from the outside and block visibility. Yeah, you say, &quot;but I like my transparent water.&quot; Before you dismiss this idea entirely check out the example map with r_speeds turned on (or the screenshots below, taken from another map) and note the difference.<br><br>


	<center><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/poly_count/poly_count14.jpg"><br>Transparent water. Notice that the engine sees the bottom of the pool.</center><br><br>

	<p><a name="nodraw"></a><b>No draw = No polys</b><br>
	This may be the most obvious one of all (so why was it the last method we thought of?). Environment (or sky) textures do not contribute towards the polygon count. You can replace brushes that do little to contribute to the look of a room with sky brushes to lower your polygon count. In the example map, a small section of the ceiling has been replaced with a sky brush, resulting in lowering the world polygon count by 4. Of course, the more complex your  ceiling is, the greater will be the savings realized. Taken to its logical conclusion, here's a screenshot from our ultimate deathmatch map:<br><br>

	<center><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/poly_count/poly_count16.jpg"><br>Not much to look at, but check out the r_speeds! Yeah, OK, it's a dumb idea. Shut up.</center><br><br>

	<p><b>NOTE: This method is best used on brushes which do not face other parts of a map. If a sky brush is located between two map areas, the player may sometimes see through the brushes of another area and into that area. These visual errors are sometimes hard to fix.

<h1><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>
For those of you who are using Geoffrey DeWan's version of Qrad3 version 1.03, this is going to be a real treat. If you have read the text file included with the executable, you may have noticed the mention of a sun feature. For whatever reason, everyone I have spoken to has been reluctant to try it.
</p>
<p>
Not only is the sun feature incredibly easy to use, but it also provides a lot more versatility than straight environmental lighting.  Plus, it looks a whole lot better. This tutorial is dedicated to helping you get started with using the sun (you'll never turn back).  It also mentions in passing another useful feature included, the -nocolor ption.
<br><br>
</p>
<h2><a name="what">What exactly does the _sun feature do?</a></h2>
<p>
As you may be aware, the ability to use environment maps is a welcome improvement that has accompanied the release of Quake2. The Environment maps are pretty gosh darned cool, but outdoor lighting is only so-so.
</p>
<p>
The _sun feature allows you to chose a direction for the sun to shine, and it lets you control diffuse lighting, highlight intensity, and sunlight color.&nbsp; Also, from what I have noticed areas lit by large amounts of sky can qrad much faster          when the area is lit by the sun instead of the sky         surface. In the test map I created, qrad took 1016        seconds when the sun was not used. The same map took 509 seconds with the sun activated.
</p>
<p>
If everything is properly entered, qrad should recognize your sun without having to use command lines.&nbsp; This was what confused me at first, since you activate your sun in your worldspawn entity, and not at the command line. In actuality, this makes things a lot easier. 
</p>
<h2>
<a name="sowhat">So what's the big deal?</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/nosun_l.jpg"><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/nosun.jpg" height="120" width="160" align="left"></a>As you can see, outside areas look really nice, but the light looks like it is coming from everywhere. It also has a really ugly orange hue. That's not the most glaring of the things it lacks, there are no shadows!!! Well, okay, there are shadows, but they are not very well defined. The problem is, how do we get our outdoor lighting to look as cool as our indoor lighting without using a gazillion light entities and spending a couple years putting them in place? It's easier than you thought.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/sun_l.jpg"><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/sun.jpg" height="120" width="160" align="right"></a>
With a few alterations and a couple entities, a          drab outdoor scene can take on a whole lot of life and personality. There are now clearly defined shadows AND highlights. With the sun activated, outdoor scenes begin to really look like they are outside. What's better, you have complete control over the color that the sun emits.
<br><br><br><br>
</p>
<h1>How do I do it?</h1>
<h2><a name="_sun">You start with the _sun.</a></h2>
<p>
The first thing you need to do is to give the sun a vector. The qrad program looks for an entity that is targeted to an info_null. First, place a light anywhere inside your level (don't put it outside the level, or else you will create a leak). Target the light to the info_null that you are about to create. Now create your info_null and give it the appropriate targetname. The position of the info_null relative to the light that targets it will tell qrad the angle that the sun shines.
</p>
<p>
Add the _sun key to your worldspawn options (the same place you use to set your map's entering message). Give it a key value that is the same as your info_null's targetname. Here's an example from the .map file I used for the screenshots above.
</p>
<div class="bodytext">
<font face="Lucida Console">
"classname"&nbsp;&nbsp;"worldspawn"<br>
"sky"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"unit1_"<br>
"message"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Map With Sun"<br>
"_sun"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"star"
</font>
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
<font face="Lucida Console">
"classname"&nbsp;&nbsp;"light"<br>
"target"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"star"<br>
"origin"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"220 -232 272"
</font>
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
<font face="Lucida Console">
"classname"&nbsp;&nbsp;"info_null"<br>
"targetname"&nbsp;"star"<br>
"origin"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"192 -208 224"
</font>
</div>
<h5>For those of you that are confused about the Worldspawn entity. It is the place where you set all of the options such as sky, gravity, and map name. You simply add _sun to the keys.</h5>
<p>
If you have any brush faces that are on the same plane as a lit sky face, AND they faces have an unobstructed line of sight to each other, then you will get unexpected and undesirable effects. Make sure that your sky and non-sky faces are either not on the same plane, or not visible to each other. Failure to do so may cause sunlight to appear where it doesn't belong.
</p>
<p>
The final thing you need to do to make sure that your sun is working right is to give all of your sky textures a light value. Apply a light value (any light value) to all of your texture surfaces with the "sky" flag. If you do not do this, your sun may not work right. 
</p>

<h3><a name="_sun_light">Light me up!</a></h3>
<p>
Now that your sun is in place, the hard part is done. All that is left is to set the light values. The first thing we shall do is to set the highlight value. This is the value of any surface that has a clear line of sight to the sun. Add the _sun_light key to your worldspawn entity, and give it a value.  I have noticed that lower values tend to be quite dark. The screenshot above has a _sun_light value of 800.
</p>
<p>
How does this work? Well, qrad calculates the x y and z angles of the sun's direction, then checks all surfaces. From each surface, it checks if the sun is viewable at the opposite angle. In other words, the opposite angle of the sun's direction is calculated, the program checks each surface          at that angle.&nbsp; If it encounters a lit sky, then it is not in the shadow. If it encounters a solid without the sky flag, then it is in the shade.
</p>
<h3><a name="_sun_ambient">How about the shade?</a></h3>
<p>
With highlights, there must be shadows. If the shadows were completely unlit, it would be too harsh. After all, the diffuse light of a sky emits some light, even if it is not as bright as the sun. The _sun_ambient option allows you to fill your shadows. A value of 50-200 works best for this.
</p>
<p>
For a good example of how diffuse lighting works, take a look at the shadows outside on a sunny day. If you try to emulate this, you can't go wrong.
</p>
<h3><a name="_sun_color">Setting the sun's color</a></h3>
<p>
To give you absolute control over your sunlight, Geoffrey DeWan included the _sun_color option. This allows you to make your sun project any color without doing any screwy texture swapping.
</p>
<p>
Simply add the _sun_color key to your worldspawn and give it a color value just like you would to a light entity (I find that 1 1 .85 works good for a medium yellow light).  For a review of what your worldspawn entity should look like now, see the <a href="#example">example</a>.
</p>
<h2>In as few words possible</h2>

<h3><a name="sun">Using the sun feature</a></h3>
<p>
First, create a light and target it to an info_null. This will be your sun's angle.
</p>
<p>
Next, add the _sun key to your worldspawn, and enter the targetname of the info_null.
</p>
<p>
Make sure all of your sky textures have the light flag checked and a light value.
</p>
<p>
Add the _sun_light value to your worldspawn, and give it a light value.
</p>
<p>
Add the _sun_ambient value to your worldspawn, and give it a light value.
</p>
<p>
Add a _sun_color value to your worldspawn, and give it a value.
</p>
<p>
Run qrad3 as you normally would (make sure it's the one by Geoffry DeWan, version 1.03, or ArghRad 1.0).
</p>
<h3><a name="comments">Some closing thoughts</a></h3>
<p>
Version 1.02 of DeWan's qrad3 used the sun, sun_light, sun_ambient, and sun_color keys. This was annoying, because they would pop up a message "sun is not a valid field" when you would run the game.  Now that he has added an underscore before the keys, the error is gone, and everything          is peachy keen.</p>
<p>
The sun feature is incredibly useful. It is a definite improvement over the original qrad3 code. It is by the will of Id software that we have the source code available to improve an already great game, and by the hard work of the fans that the tools are there. Everyone should show their          appreciation of the spirit of free information by not plagiarizing or pirating software.

<h2>
<a name="nocolor">How to qrad without color</A></h2>
<p>
If you have ever compiled a level with colored or texture lighting only to find out later that it looks a lot better without color, you can easily recompile it without having to change all of your entities and messing with your surface properties. All you have to do is add -nocolor to your          qrad command line. For example, if you normally compile with this command line:
</p>
<div class="bodytext">
qrad3 -extra -bounce 40 [filename]
</div>
<p>
You just add -noclor to it and you're good to go.
</p>
<div class="bodytext">
qrad3 -extra -bounce 40 -nocolor [filename]
</div>
<p>
The light intensities may not be the same as it was when you had color, but it shouldn't change too much. Here's a little clip from the text file included with version 1.03.
</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><h5>
Disables colored lighting.  All colored light is computed as normal, but final lighting results are converted to grayscale according to the formula that is used to compute the Y signal of a color television broadcast (which is what a black & white television displays). The colors are not weighted equally (0.299Red + 0.587Green + 0.144Blue).         A green of the same intensity as a blue will convert to a brighter lightmap than the blue. Red falls in the middle.

<h3>Why should I use something new...</h3>

<div class="bodytext">
<a name=why>...when what I have works fine?</a>
</div>
<p>
Progress.
</p>
<p>
For real, though, ArghRad is like a version update of gddqrad3. It fixes some of limitations of gdqrad3 that caused the shadows caused by sunlight to look blocky, and made some definite improvements (like ambient color control and multiple suns. It does all of this WITHOUT sacrificing support of gddqrad3 and qrad3.
</p>

<h3>What's new?</h3>
<p>
Here are all of the new keys available for the sun. If you're hungry for more, go to the online manual         at the Arghrad page.
</p>

<h5>
&quot;_sun_angle&quot;<br>
&quot;_sun_mangle&quot;<br>
&quot;_sun_vector&quot;<br>
&quot;_sun_diffuse&quot;<br>
&quot;_sun_diffade&quot;<br>
&quot;_sun_difwait&quot;
</h5>
<p>
"_sun_angle" and "_sun_mangle" are aliases for the same function, as are "_sun_fade" and "_sun_wait", but that still leaves us with four new options, plus the ability to use up to four suns.
</p>
<div class="bodytext">
<a name=four>Did you say FOUR suns?</a>
</div>
<p>
Yes! You can now use up to four suns in your maps, each with their own color and angle. To use multiple suns, you would simply define them as you normally do, except you substitute "_sun2" "_sun3" and "_sun4" for "_sun" when entering information on your second, third, and fourth suns.
</p>
<p>
You can use multiple suns on all of the _sun keys except "_sun_ambient".
</p>
<div class="bodytext">
<a name=shadow>Ambient shadow coloring</a>
</div>
<p>
You can color your ambient shadows now (the part that can't see the sun, but can see the sky). If you define a straight light value instead of a color value, the shadow color will default          to the average of all of your suns' colors. To define the color of the shadow, simply enter three values after the "_sun_ambient" key instead of one.
</p>
<h5>"_sun_ambient" "[red] [green] [blue]"</h5>
<p>
Each value represents the brightness of each individual color, so if the value entered were 120 150 50, the shadow color would have a minimum red brightness of 120, a minimum green brightness         of 150, and a minimum blue brightness of 50.    </p>
<div class="bodytext">
<a name=diffusion>Shadow diffusion</a>
</div>
<p>
This feature is so freakin' cool, I can't contain myself! What shadow diffusion does is provide an buffer of hazy shadow between the shade and the direct sunlight. This can make your shadows look much smoother less harsh. To define the diffusion, simply enter a value less than the highlight value,
and greater than the shadow value.
</p>
<h5>
"_sun_diffuse"   "[value]"
</h5>
<p>
To control the fade distance of the diffusion, Tim Wright has added the _sun_diffade and _sun_difwait keys. A value less than 1 will cause the diffusion to fade out slower, while a value greater than 1 will make it fade faster. Be aware, however, that if you use a large value, you may need to reduce         your -chopsky value (or else you will get a chunky shadow). This defaults to a value of 1, and any value entered will scale relative to the default. For example, if you entered a value of .5, the diffusion would fade twice as rapidly as it          did at 1.
</p>
<h5>
"_sun_diffade"   "[value]"
</h5>
<h5>
"_sun_difwait"   "[value]"
</h5>
<div class="bodytext">
<a name=alternate>Alternate aiming techniques</A>
</div>
<p>
There are now two additional ways to aim your sun (both of which you can substitute for the "_sun" "targetname" method. The first method is angle aiming. This uses pitch and yaw to aim. This method is the same as is used to aim info_player_intermission minus the roll.
</p>
<p>
The yaw is the position on the z axis. You aim yaw the same way you aim a door, or a player facing, with 0 pointing east, and moving counter-clockwise. Pitch is the angle on the horizon. Pitch values range from negative 90 to positive 90. -90 points straight down, and 90 points straight up.

The second method is vector aiming. By using vector         aiming, you enter a vector coordinate into the value field, and ArghRad will calculate the angle from the origin (0 0 0) to the vector (x y z) coordinates you entered. The resulting angle         will be the sun's angle.

<h2>Surface Properties and Content Properties</h2>
<blockquote>
		By Fishman
</blockquote><br><br>

 <p>One of the newest, coolest editing options in quake2 is the ability to set surface properties and content properties. They are:
    <ul type="square">
        <b>Surface Properties</b>
        <li>light
        <li>slick
        <li>sky
        <li>warp
        <li>trans33, trans66
        <li>flowing
        <li>nodraw
        <li>hint
        <li>skip
    </ul>
    <ul type="square">
        <b>Content Properties</b>
        <li>solid
        <li>window
        <li>aux
        <li>lava, slime, water
        <li>mist
        <li>player clip, monster clip
        <li>current_0, _90, _180, _270, _up, _down
        <li>origin
        <li>monster, corpse
        <li>detail
        <li>translucent
        <li>ladder
    </ul>
    </p>

<h3>Differences between a surface property and a content property.</h3>

<p>The main difference between surface and content properties is that <b>surface  properties</b> can be applied to any number of a brush's faces.  <b>Content  properties</b> must be the same on every face of a brush.<br><br>
For example, you could mark one brush face as light, or two face, or three, etc, but for a detail brush, every face must be marked as detail, or you will get an error when you compile the level (<b>Entity x, Brush x: mixed face contents</b>) Thanks <a href="mailto:autolycus@valvesoftware.net">autolycus</a> for the above info.
</p>

<h3>How to Set a Surface\Content Property</h3>

<p>In each editor setting surface properties are done differently.
    <ul type="square">
        
<li><b>In BSP:</b><br>
            Select the brush, press the '<b>S</b>' key, select the properties you want to set, then hit apply to brush, or apply to face. <br>&nbsp;

<li><b>In QERadiant & GTKRadiant:</b><br>
            Surface properties work the same in QERadient as in BSP. Select the brush, 
            press the '<b>S</b>' key, select the properties you want, then hit apply.
            <br>&nbsp;
       
 <li><b>In QOOLE:</b><br>
            Select the brush or surface and hit <b>alt-t</b>, select the property you 
            want, hit apply
            <br>&nbsp;
        
<li><b>In QuArK:</b><br>
            In QuArK you must select the brush and side you wish to add the surface 
            attribute to and then click (no flag). <br><br>
                    
<li><b>In WorldCraft 1.6:</b><br>
            Select the brush & Press Shift+A to call up the face properties window.<br><br>
        
<li><b>In DeathMatch Maker 2:</b><br>
            My pal <a href="mailto:DMM2Editor@aol.com">Richard Neff</a> has sent along this 
            <a href="/content/quake2/tutorials/surface/dmm2.zip">ScreenCam tutorial</a>(405 kb) on how to work with surface 
            properties and contents. So if your a DMM2 user then check em out.
            <br>&nbsp;
        
<li><b>In qED:</b><br><ol>
                <li>Select the brush from the level outline (tree view).
                <li>Select the "texture" tab from the properties notebook.
                <li>Right-click on the proper brush surface in the list or the top
                    &lt;brush&gt; line for all brush surfaces.
                <li>Select "surface attributes" from the pop-up menu that appears.
                <li>Put a check mark in the proper boxes and set the light value
                if necessary.

 <p>If there is an editor I missed (which I did) and you know how to use the surface properties then 
    please post on the <a href="http://forums.gamedesign.net/viewforum.php?f=14">RUST Q2 forum</a> and I will add it.
    </p>
    
<h3>What the Surface Properties/Contents Do</h3>

<ul type="square">
    <li><b>light</b><br>
        This means that the face will emit light the color of the texture. So if you 
        have a yellow texture emmiting light then the light will be yellow. This is 
        probably the most often used and useful surface property. To set the 
        brightness of the light you must enter the number of the brightness in the 
        value edit box that should appear on most editors' surface properties 
        windows'. This is a great alternative for creating your own light entities, 
        because it is much easier and provides more realistic lighting effects.<br>
        <br>
        The only thing that you should know is that sometimes, depending on the size 
        of the brush that will be emitting light, you will have to set the brightness
        of the light very bright. Sometimes as high as <b>10000</b> is needed.
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>slick</b><br>
        Slick will make the selected surface slippery and the player will slide. Used
        in the id level cool1, the Cooling Station. There's an area where you jump on
        some crates and hop onto a large piston that takes you up to the next
        floor.  At the bottom around the piston there's a green slick area you can
        slide around in.
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>warp</b><br>
        Makes the surface warp like water. Should be used when making water, forcefields, lava, etc.
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>trans33, trans66</b><br>
        These make the selected surface transparent. 33 means 66 percent transparent, 
        66 means 33 percent transparent. So therefore trans33 is going to be more 
        transparent then trans66.<br>
        <br>
        You should also remember that <b>entities cannot be transparent</b>, so you 
        couldn't have a transparent func_water, or a transparent func_door, etc.
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>flowing</b><br>
        flowing makes the surface look like it is moving. It is usually used along with 
        the <b>current_*</b> surface property to create the effect of a river flowing.<br>
        <br>
        It will move in the direction of the texture so if you wish it to flow in a 
        different direction then you need to <b>adjust the rotation of the texture</b>.
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>nodraw</b><br>
        This is used for triggers and clip brushes. What it does is makes the selected
        surface invisible if it is a clip brush or a trigger such as a trigger_once 
        and a trigger_multiple.<br>
        <br>
        By default though, triggers are already set to not drawn.
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>hint</b><br>
        A hint brush blocks vis from seeing into certain areas, thus decreasing frame 
        rate(which is a good thing) They are difficult to determine where to place though.
        There is a good <a href="http://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.gamedesign.net/node/52">tutorial</a> 
        written by <a href="mailto:jcaesar@mediaone.net">Joel Caesar</a> on hint brushes 
        that will help you figure out how to use them.
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>solid</b><br>
        Solid is the default for all brushes. Not real sure on why you would have to use it though.
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>window</b><br>
        Prevents the renderer from drawing the backfaces of a brush.  Used on windows 
        (or other transparent brushes.) For an example, look at the window at he very beginning of base1.
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>skip</b><br>
        A skip brush is very strange. It does nothing if a whole brush is set as a skip brush, 
        but if you only set one face of it to a skip brush then it will create the effect of 
        one way glass. The player on the side of the brush that is marked as skip will be able
        to see through the brush, but not shoot through it, and the player on the sides which
        are not marked skip will not be able to see through or shoot through the brush.
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>aux</b><br>
        Does not do anything. I may be wrong though.
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>lava, slime, water</b><br>
        these 3 are pretty self explanatory. Lava takes off the most damage. Slime takes off a 
        lower amount of damage, and water takes off no damage, unless you stay in it too long.<br>
        <br>
        The brush that has one of these properties turned on will not actually warp like water until
        you also give the brush the <b>warp</b> property. It will act the same way though without warp 
        set (you will be able to walk through it).
        It's cool to use these attributes with different textures, like give the lava attribute to a 
        metal brush, etc for some strange different effects. For example, in the 
        <a href="/content/quake2/tutorials/surface/surface.zip">example
        map</a> I created water but I didnt use a water texture. I used the crystal texture. It turned out pretty good.
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>mist</b><br>
        Mist makes the brush nonsolid, thus you could walk through it. You can also create a mist 
        type effect by setting the mist, warp, and trans_33 properties on. Pretty cool.
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>player clip, monster clip</b><br>
        The player cannot walk through a brush set with player clip but he will be able to shoot 
        through it. Monster clip is the same thing but it affects the monster_ entities instead of 
        the player. Good for not allowing monsters past a certain point or restricting the player 
        so he/she can't get into areas in which there is a possibility of getting stuck.  The use of clip brushes discussed in detail in <a href="http://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.gamedesign.net/node/49"this tutorial</a>.<br>
        <br>
        You must also have nodraw set for the clip properties to work.
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>current_0, _90, _180, _270, _up, _down</b><br>
        all the current properties are used to push the player in the selected direction (in water). 
        So current_0 will push the player in the angle of 0, which is straight right.<br>
        <br>
        The majority of the time current_ will be used along with the flowing and water properties to 
        create the effect of flowing, moving water.
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>origin</b><br>
        The origin property is used with certain entities like the <a href="http://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.gamedesign.net/node/39">turret_</a> 
        entities, <a href="http://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.gamedesign.net/node/24#func_rotating">func_rotate</a>, and 
        <a href="http://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.gamedesign.net/node/24#func_door_rotating">func_door_rotating</a>. Check those corresponding pages on how
        to use the origin property with these entities.
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>monster, corpse</b><br>
        These do nothing at all. I may be wrong though
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>detail</b><br>
        Detail brushes are very useful. They can be used to decrease vis time for a level. When a brush is 
        marked as a detail brush, vis will ignore it, thus decreasing the amount of time that qvis3 will 
        take while compiling your level.<br>
        <br>
        Too many detail brushes though will actually slow a level down. Try to keep detail brushes restricted
        to brushes that the player will not often see.<br>
        <br>
        Detail brushes, and how to use them, are discussed in 
        <a href="http://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.gamedesign.net/node/53">this tutorial</a>.
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>translucent</b><br>
        if you have water and trans33 or 66 *not* set and the surface
        light flag 0 as well, then the water brush interior isn't lighted.
        when you set the translucent flag, light from outside can come inside
        although the water surface is not-see-thru. thanks 
        <a href="mailto:martin.fuchs@physik.fu-berlin.de">Martin Fuchs</a>
        <br>&nbsp;
    <li><b>ladder</b><br>
        The ladder attribute allows the player to climb up or down the brush. Most often used for creating ladders. 
        A number of people have been having problems with creating ladders but they are actually pretty easy to make.<br>
        <br>
        Make the ladder and then give every brush that the ladder is made up of the surface property of ladder. It's that 
        simple. The trouble comes up when you have the steps of the ladder too far apart and the player can't touch the next 
        step. If this is the case then you will have to create a very thin brush right in front of the ladder and set 
        the surface property player_clip and ladder to it. This will create the illusion of the player climbing up the
        ladder when in fact the player is climbing up the invisible player_clip brush.
        <br>&nbsp;
</ul>

<h3>Things to Remember about Surface/Content Properties</h3>

 <p>All the textures that are used with quake2 and are available for use by level 
    designers have default surface properties already set. For example... If you 
    select a glass texture, then it will already have the trans_33 property on. It 
    also follows that all the light textures, already have the light surface property
    set and with a light value that the creators of the texture thought was right. 
    All of this can overridden though if you desire.<br><blockquote>(Editor's Note:  Users of GTKRadiant, which was not written with Quake 2 in mind, may find that Surface & Content Properties are not set by default and will have to be set manually)</blockquote>
    <br>
    Surface Properties can also be mixed. So you could have one texture with lava, 
    flowing, current_0, tran_33 all set.<br>
    <br>
    Also remember that the surface <B>properties</B> can have selected faces with properties
    while, surface <B>contents</B> MUST have the whole brush selected with the same content 
    or a mixed face error will occur.<br>
    <br>
    The 
    <b><a href="/content/quake2/tutorials/surface/surface.zip">example map</a></b> 
    I made does not show examples of all the surface properties but it does show some
    potential of some of the cool effects you can get. It also shows how you can 
    misuse the light emitting textures. =) Way too colorful. <br>
    <br>

<br>
By James Parkman
<p>
I got an email from someone who played my maps, asking how to create the effect of a wall being painted with multiple textures. The solution is simple, but there are some nice tricks you can use to enhance both the appearance and speeds of rooms created like this. Here goes.
</p>
<p>
Ok, the goal here is to create a room whose walls appear to be painted with separate but well integrated textures. This is something you need to learn pretty quickly when editing Quake 2. Tim Willits mastered this in his levels in Quake2, and that's basically where I got the inspiration for the base style I used in Abandon All Hope. The textures were made to be used this way, and are usually clustered together by name in a manner that makes it easy to find a nicely fitting group of textures for your room. For instance, a lot of the e1u1 textures are 64x64, and their edges are specifically drawn to fit together perfectly with one another.
</p>
<p>
The idea is to <strong>let the textures do the work for you</strong>. Complex architecture may look pretty cool, but your speeds will suffer, and your vis times will completely skyrocket. So instead of adding to your poly count by crafting decorations, it's a lot more effective in the Quake 2 engine to simply meld two brushes, each painted with a well fitted texture.
</p>
<p>
<h4>An Example</h4>
<p><font size="2" face="verdana">Here you've got a simple wall. Paint it with one of the "duct" textures from e1u1, you'll notice that the texture doesn't look so hot when it's used on a large brush. So take that section of wall, decrease it's height by 64 units, and create another brush of equal width and length, this one 64 units high. Place this section in the spot that's now open from decreasing the former large wall brush. Here's 2 screenshots, before and after:
<p><center><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/tbtut01.jpg" width="300" height="225"> <img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/tbtut02.jpg" width="300" height="225"></center></p>

<p>This adds a lot, without the need for complex architecture and outcroppings which slow down the level... plus it's simply got a nice even flow which doesn't draw your attention immediately, but creates a deep atmosphere within your level... to me, that's the difference between a level thats a work of art, and one that's "pretty cool". The best authors out there have this method down, and use it alot.
</p>
<p>Let's throw a wall support in now, using the same principle:
</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/tbtut03.jpg" width="300" height="225"></center></p>
<p>... no  seams, blended well... get a motif like this going, and your level is one step closer to becoming a classic... take for instance this hallway from Abandon All Hope.
</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/tbtut04.jpg" width="350" height="263"></center></p>
<p>I've used this effect to create an entire hallway, including the ceiling, walls, and support structures. Notice the depth and atmosphere this gives to the area. I'd say that this hallway was the first time I truly had that lightbulb flicker in my skull about the "art" of texture use... before this, I'd fight the editor alot trying to stretch and align whatever texture I was working with to fit the architecture. The key is, the OPPOSITE is what you should aim to do: design the architecture around the textures you will be using for your level. Of course, the brush count here is significantly higher than a simple cubic hall would give, but chances are that if you build a simple cudic hall, you're going to spend alot of time and waste alot of cpu power on decorations, or the hallway will end up looking quite plain.
</p>

<p>One other thing I should mention is light fixture placement. Personally, I like to carve my light brushes into the wall... some authors, even very good ones, don't mind having their lights jut out from the wall, which makes editing alot easier for them, as they don't have to deal with carving up their walls. If you do decide, however, to carve your lights into walls, keep in mind that you should make your light brush at least as thick as your wall, or you'll be splitting your wall brush not only into the 4 sections that result from splitting with a cube, but a 5th section, lengthwise, resulting from splitting a brush with another which is less thick. This makes it alot more difficult to move and resize your walls, and should you have alot of lights like this, you'll soon end up with a nasty  mess.</p>

	</blockquote>
	
<br><br><b>In the Beginning...</b>

<p>So, you've finally played Quake 2 until your eyes are bloodshot and rather than get some sleep, you've decided, &quot;Hey, it would be sooooo cool to create my own levels!&quot; Unfortunately, you're getting into level design rather late, since Quake 2 is really an evolution of Id games since Wolfenstein 3D. So, keep one thing in the back of your mind: it is <b>not</b> a trivial thing to do Quake 2 editing. It is a very long and time consuming process - but, rest assured, the first time you blast a Strogg in a level you've created yourself, you'll be very glad you put the time into it 

<p>Just be aware that not only are you going to have to spend time creating the level, but you'll have to spend time learning the basic concepts, learning the editor you've chosen, planning the design of your level, waiting a <b>lot</b> on the compilers to do their job, and putting in the time to do all the picky little detail work on your level before it's &quot;good enough&quot; to post. Be fully aware that all of this takes some serious time, so don't expect to have a quality level in a few days.
	
<br><br><b>The First Steps</b> 

<p>The first thing you need (other than the registered version of Quake 2) is a level editor. Right now, I'm only talking about an editor that creates Quake 2 levels, not skins, texture, entities, models, etc. Some editors also include a few of those functions, but right now, let's just concentrate on the basic level editing functions. The first questions that are probably popping into your head are: &quot;What's the best editor?&quot; or &quot;What did Id use? That <b>must</b> be the best editor!&quot; First and foremost, you have to understand that <b>there is no best editor!</b>

<p>I know, all your friends babble endlessly how great one editor is and how another sucks. But, the bottom line is that you are the one that gets to spend hours bleary-eyed in front of this thing, so you need to check out all the editors you can before committing to a single one. In fact, you may have already jumped the gun and bought/downloaded an editor. That's ok too, just realize that although it may be the editor you learn on, it may not be the editor that you use to do all your later maps. (And Id used a rather hard-to-get working QE4, which had an interface that was designed more for people who REALLY knew the game rather than beginners. If you're really interested in trying to use QE4 under Windows 95, you're probably much better off just downloading QERadiant - trust me on this.)
	
<br><br><b>Where Do I Get a Level Editor?</b> 

<p>Fortunately, you're in luck. Go to the Links page here at Rust and you'll see a listing of some of the major Quake 2 editors. Keep in mind that some of them are freeware, some are shareware, and finally some are retail products. However, don't assume that the retail products are any better/worse than the others. Also, each has it share of advantages, disadvantage and flaws. Most also have Web sites dedicated to updates, tutorials and other editor specific information (as opposed to Rust which is pretty editor non-specific.)

<p>Additionally, there is something you may need beyond the level editor itself: the compiling tools. Id uses 3 compilers to turn the maps that editors create into fully playable levels for Quake 2. They are QBSP3, QVIS3, and QRAD3. Each of these has a different purpose which will be described later in this document. Some editors provide these files with the package/download, while others require you to download them yourself.
	
<br><br><b>Knowing the Components of the Quake 2 Engine</b>

<p>The key components of the Quake 2 engine are: Entities, Attributes, Brushes, .map files, and the compiler programs. Let's look at each and what it does.

	<b>Entities</b>

	<p>Entities are the &quot;active&quot; objects of Quake 2. Things like monsters, weapons, powerups, triggers, etc. are all entities. Each entity in Quake 2 has a specific task that is hard coded, either in the regular Quake 2 engine or as a separate add-on modification, such as Capture the Flag (CTF) or the Mission Pack. Additionally, there are two different types of entities: point entities and solid entities.

	<p>A point entity is an entity that has a model preassigned to it. For example, a monster. The monster does not require the user to create the physical representation of the monster or its movement. This has already been done by the entity creator. When you place a monster entity in your editor, Quake 2 automatically puts the monster in its proper place. Typically, this also means that if you use a box and make it a monster, you don't need to worry about the size of the box, since it will be replaced by the appropriate model when Quake 2 runs. Some examples of point entities: monsters, lights, health, player starts and powerups.

	<p>A solid entity is an entity where the level designer does have to give a solid geometry in order for the entity to work. An example of this is a door. You have to make a door the size and shape you want. The advantage of having to define the solid for the entity is to allow a greater design range for which to create those entities. For example, you may want a double door rather than a single door, so being able to define this gives you that option. Examples of solid entities are: doors, triggers, buttons, trains, and platforms.

	<p>A common thing about all entities is that certain things need to be defined for each entity in the level to modify the behavior of that entity. For example a trigger isn't much good if you can't tell what is to be done by that trigger. So, each entity has properties that can be defined by the user. These properties are known as <em>attributes</em>.

	<br><br><b>Attributes</b>
	
	<p>An attribute is basically, the stuff that defines how an entity is supposed to work. For example, a trigger needs to have something to target when the player goes over it. So, one attribute of a trigger is the Target attribute, which points to the name of whatever is supposed to happen when the player runs over it. If the trigger is to open a door, then the Target attribute will have the name of that door. Additionally, a trigger entity also has a delay, which allows you to set the amount of time has to pass before the trigger becomes &quot;active&quot; again.

	<br><br><b>Brushes</b>
	
	<p>Now that we know what entities are, we can adequately describe what brushes are. Brushes are simply anything in the Quake 2 level <b>other</b> than entities. Basically, this means the walls, floor, ceiling and anything else that the player can't pass through, but don't really do any other functions. A good way to think of brushes is to equate them to bricks or building blocks. They simply define the structure of a level.

	<p>Some things to note about brushes, however. A brush can only be convex. This means that no &quot;dents&quot; are in the brush. You can't pass a straight line through a brush where it passes out of the brush and back in. For example, a square is a convex brush. A &quot;C&quot; shape, is not a convex brush. However, you can make multiple brushes to comprise a &quot;C&quot; shape.

	<p>Additionally, brushes must be solid and are comprised of straight edges. You can't ever be &quot;inside&quot; a brush (rooms are actually &quot;hollowed out&quot; brushes where you have six solid brushes making up the walls, roof, and floor.) The Quake 2 engine also doesn't support curved edges - however, you can have many straight edges on a &quot;side&quot; that make it seem curved. This was done by Id and other levels to simulate rounded objects.

	<br><br><b>*.MAP Files</b>
	
	<p>This is the standard for all Quake 2 editing files. However, as with any type of &quot;standard&quot; in the industry, each editor may implement .map files differently - which may make it harder to open a .map file created in one editor into another. That aside however, all editors (whether they are able to import .map files are not) must be able to create a .map file so the compilers can create a playable level.

<p>The structure of the .map file is actually pretty straightforward. It is a text file (meaning you can open it and modify it directly in any text editor, such as Notepad) that holds descriptions and attributes of the brushes and the entities that make up the level.

	<br><br><b>Compiler Programs</b>
	
        <p>As I mentioned earlier, you need 3 compiler programs in order to create playable Quake 2 levels. These compilers turn the text-based .map file into a compiled .bsp file which users can play. The first compiler, QBSP3, creates the initial .bsp file. This breaks up all the brushes into smaller brushes and builds the playable .bsp file. In fact, you could just run the QBSP3 compiler and have a playable map (and you'll usually do this as your maps get bigger for testing purposes.) However, the other two compilers do more modifications to the .bsp file that make it run faster and look better.
        
        <p>The next compiler, the QVIS3 program, does something known as visibility calculating. Basically, it calculates what a player can see from any given viewpoint in the level. The primary function of the VIS compiler is to speed the level up during gameplay be pre-determining whether or not a player can see certain areas of the map at the current viewpoint. While you may not notice much of a difference in the actual appearance of a VIS compiled map, the speed should almost always be faster than a map that hasn't had the VIS compile run.
        
        <p>The final compiler, QRAD3, is the lighting (radiosity) generator. Until this compiler is run, the map will not have any lighting effects defined. This means that the level will run completely lit, regardless of the location of any light entities or surface texture lighting. This is the last compiler to run, meaning you must run the QBSP3 and the QVIS3 compilers before this compiler can be run.
        
        <p>A thing to note about the compiled .bsp files. In Quake 1 textures used in the level were kept inside the .bsp file. In Quake 2 however, they are not. So, if you decide to use custom textures other than the ones originally used in the Id game, you have to provide those textures either in a .zip file or .pak file (which Id used to store all the .bsp level files) to distribute those textures. However, this is a little outside the range of what you should worry about as a beginner.

	<br><br><b>And Just What the Heck is a Leak?</b>

	<p>The dreaded leak - the biggest stumbling block to the beginner editor (and it even plagues more advanced editors from time to time). To understand leaks you need to understand how the Quake 2 engine views the world around it. By default, anything a that isn't in a self contained room, is in the 'void.' (not to be confused with the sky) Players can NEVER see or go into the void.

	<p>The best way to handle this is to realize that your level much be completely contained. Imagine filling up your level completely with liquid...if any of the liquid could escape, then your level is not completely contained - and a leak occurs. However, this checking occurs from the player start position and works out - so, if you have the player starting outside the outer walls of your level, a leak could occur as well.

	<p>Additionally, the player can't be able to see into the void. So, you can't use transparent textures as outer walls. This will also cause a leak error to be displayed.

        <p>As I mentioned, don't confuse this with the sky. A sky is simply a special texture property. The Quake 2 engine gives the illusion that there is more out there beyond the limits of your map, but from a design standpoint, your level still has to be self contained and the player can't see the void anywhere.

	<p>Keep in mind leaks can be very small...the slightest gap between two outer walls can cause leaks (and on a more advanced note - be sure to use the right compiler for your editor since some editors, such as Qoole, use 'floating point' sizes, while some compilers round off.) And some editors can use what's known as pointfile information to draw a line to leaks, while other editors don't offer this feature.

	<p>But, why worry about leaks? First and foremost, leaks are bad because they slow the engine down a lot. Also, they prevent you from running the VIS and RAD compilers, so you don't get proper lighting or a fast playing level. Both of which are considered bad and prevent you from having your levels posted or played by others. Finally, anywhere a player can see into the void may cause effect like the &quot;Hall of Mirrors&quot; effect where the last image is constantly displayed or a &quot;grey area&quot; effect, where the player is able to see grey where the void is.

</blockquote>

<b>What about the Next Steps?</b>

<p>Ok, so you've learned the basic concepts of Quake 2 editing, now lets look at what all Quake 2 levels need:

<blockquote>

	<b>The Worldspawn Entity</b>
	
	<p>The Worldspawn entity is a special entity that defines certain things about the map, like the CD track to play, the sky to use, the next level, and other things that affect the entire level. Keep in mind that with some editors, this may be listed or access differently (Qoole and DMM2 come to mind - Qoole requires you to bring up the entity window while no other entities are selected and DMM2 uses File, Game Options to edit these settings.)

	<br><br><b>A Room</b>
	
	<p>This is pretty obvious. But, you do need to have a least a room before you can place entities into your quake level

	<br><br><b>The Player_Start Entity</b>
	
	<p>Even in DM and CTF maps, you probably want to put this entity down to test your levels. Some editors will even put this entity in if you don't explicitly specify it. You can have only one player_start entity. However, you need to have a player start, even if you use the DM or CTF starts, in order to play your map.

	<p>The player_start has to be inside the level otherwise a leak will occur. This is especially important with editors that put a player_start where the observer in the editor is when you don't have an explicit player_start entity defined.
	
</blockquote>

<b>And that's about all the basics!</b>

<p>That's is the overview of Quake 2 editing in general.
Obviously, we didn't cover every single aspect of editing. Heck,
we didn't even talk about how to create a room! That's because
most anything else you want to do is going to be specific to a
particular editor. Some editors will create a room automatically
with all six sides, while some editors will require you to create
a box, then &quot;hollow&quot; it out. Check out the tutorials
for your editor on either the editor's home page or pages
dedicated to that editor to help you get started.

<p>However, Rust lists all the Quake 2 entities and attributes
for the entities included with the Id game (however, not all
modifications, total conversions (TCs), and mission pack entities
are listed). Additionally, other tutorials are here for helping
you to create better Quake 2 levels.

<div align="center"><br><br><b>Some Tips for Beginners</b><br><br></div>

<table width="400" align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td> 
        <li><b>Go slowly.</b> Don't try to make the perfect level on your first few attempts! Make small practice levels to learn basic concepts and effects before implementing them in a level you care about.<br><br>     
        
        <li><b>Read a </b><em><b>lot</b></em><b>! </b>Read through all of the tutorials here at Rust before you go head-first into map building. In fact, you may want to fire up the ol' printer and get some of this stuff in hardcopy so you have it in front of you while editing. Trust me, you'll save yourself a lot of time and frustration later on if you do this.<br><br>
        
        <li><b>Learn your editor!</b> One of the best things you can do is visit sites dedicated to your editor and learn what it can/can't do. It always amazes me the number of people who complain, &quot;My editor can't do this!&quot; when, in fact, it can. They just didn't take the time to read all the tutorials out there.<br><br>
        
        <li><b>Start small!</b> Don't try to do every single cool effect you've ever seen. A lot of this stuff was done by people who had done a lot more maps than you have, so don't assume that you can do the cool stuff that Id or anyone else did right away. The truth of the matter is that your first few maps probably aren't even &quot;playable&quot; maps, so don't even post them - in fact, expect this and realize that they are learning experiences, not &quot;playable&quot; levels.<br><br>
        
        <li><b>Keep rooms small too!</b> The Quake engine is very picky about size. The larger the room, the more the Quake engine has to do to display the room and all the stuff in it. <b>Don't</b> do large outdoor areas!!! Until you learn what the Quake 2 engine can handle, don't even try to create outdoor rooms. This is better left for when you've gotten some basic experimenting out of the way.<br><br>
        
        <li><b>Plan ahead.</b> Without question, the biggest mistake of the beginner. Quake is very sensitive to the number of brushes and entities in a single view. The more stuff the engine has to render, the slower the gameplay. Also, knowing what you want to do makes it easier to create a level that &quot;flows&quot; well from one room to another. Keep in mind a level isn't just a bunch of different rooms connected to each other. It's something that is designed to either complete an objective in Single Player mode or to create a fair, yet interesting battleground for DM mode. You have to plan ahead to keep from spending hours on a map that doesn't even play well or doesn't look good. <br><br>

        <li><b>Ask questions, but don't bug people.</b> Most editors are willing to help a beginner out, but don't abuse that willingness. When you have a question, post it on a discussion board, like the one here at Rust, or a public discussion area, such as a newsgroup. And don't assume the world revolves around you. You're question may sit a while before it's answered (and if it goes unanswered too long either your idea can't be done or you haven't exhausted the sources of information out there.) Be sure that you've read FAQs and tutorials about Quake 2 editing and your editor specifically before posting questions - otherwise, you may get the short reply of, &quot;Check the FAQ&quot; or some other less-than-happy reply. Additionally, don't assume that an author of a tutorial, FAQ, or reply wants a personal e-mail. (Especially in my case!) You should ask before you send questions whizzing through cyberspace using e-mail, or you may not like the reply (plus still not get your question answered by someone who could normally help.) <br><br>
             
        
        <li><b>Finally, have fun!</b> Editing is a long and tedious process, but the final result almost always makes it worthwhile!

<h3>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b></h3>
This tutorial is written for Quake II and to some extent Quake 3 Arena.&nbsp;
However, all Quake engine games work on a similar principle (though not
all have hint brushes or detail brushes).
<p><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/warning.jpg" HSPACE=5 align=LEFT>This symbol
represent a very important warning or caution.

<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/q3a.jpg" HSPACE=5 align=LEFT>In Quake 3

<h3>
<b>THE MAP</b></h3>
The examples in this tutorial are going to use the following map, which
consists of 4 walls, and 2 objects in the middle:
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_quake2view.jpg" ></center>
<p>We will use the following overhead view for this tutorial:
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_base.gif" ></center>
<p>This map is a 2 dimensional map.&nbsp; Lines in this map will correspond
to polygons in the&nbsp; 3 dimensional map.&nbsp; The polygons in this
2 dimensional map will correspond to brushes in the 3 dimensional map.

<p>
<hr>
<br><a NAME=TheBspProcess></a>(<a href="/node/266#TOC">Table of
Contents</a>)
<h3>
THE BSP PROCESS</h3>
There are 12 extraneous polygons on the outside walls of this map, so lets
simplify matters a bit by eliminating them (which will happen anyway during
the BSP process if there are no leaks):
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_start.gif" ></center>
<p>The gray area around the edge will represent the part of the world we
do not care about since it will be outside the play area.&nbsp; There will
be some additional bsp splits by the 12 eliminated surfaces out here but
nothing that will affect the interior of the map.&nbsp; White is the empty
area a player can move around in.&nbsp; The stone is solid.

<p>During the BSP process qbsp3 takes each polygon one by one and inserts
them into the bsp tree.&nbsp; The term tree describes the data structure
the bsp nodes are stored in (if the data structure is drawn graphically
on a piece of paper, it looks something like a tree or bush).&nbsp; As
each polygon is inserted, it will split space up into smaller and smaller
regions, but it will only split up the regions it is inserted into.&nbsp;
The process is shown graphically below (if this image is not animating,
reload the page and don't stop the loading of the page, or open image up
in a separate browser window):
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_process.gif"  height=190 width=380></center>
<p>As you can see, the order the polygons are inserted have an effect on
how the map is broken up.&nbsp; Adding, deleting,&nbsp; or changing a single
brush can cause qbsp3 to go into an entirely different direction and cause
significant performance changes (either better or worse).
<p>In reality, qbsp3 uses certain rules to select which order to insert
polygons.&nbsp; First it assigns a really high priority to axial polygons.&nbsp;

These are polygons whose X values are all the same, Y values are all the
same, or Z values are all the same (in the editor, in 2 of the 3 possible
2d views, the polygon will show as a simple line).&nbsp; After that, it
will look for polygons that will split up the remaining uninserted polygons
the least.&nbsp; The bsp animation with the darker gray border is the one
much more in line with what qbsp3 will actually do.&nbsp; However, for
this tutorial, I am going to use the one with the lighter gray border for
illustrative purposes.
<p>Both the thick blue and thin black lines lie on what are known as bsp
split planes.&nbsp; They break the map up into small (or sometimes, not
so small) regions.&nbsp; Each of these regions is a bsp node.&nbsp; You
will never find a world polygon in the middle of a bsp node.&nbsp; They
all lie on a bsp node edge/side.&nbsp; Moving objects, etc. are not part
of the bsp tree and are handled separately.

<p>The thick blue lines are your solid polygons.&nbsp; You can't move through
them.&nbsp; They are almost always visible.&nbsp; If it is not visible
for whatever reason, you will probably wind up with what is known as the
Hall Of Mirrors (HOM) effect or see other, further parts of your level
through it.
<p>The thin black lines are what become your portals.&nbsp; Portals separate
bsp nodes where there is no solid polygon.&nbsp; They are not visible,
but polygons generated with a mist-ed brush, or other non solid brush can
overlap them.&nbsp; They do not block movement.&nbsp; There are actually
2 between any 2 bsp nodes (where there is no solid polygon).&nbsp; Each
of those 2 portals is attached to its respective bsp node.&nbsp; See image
below (if this image is not animating, reload the page and don't stop the
loading of the page, or open image up in a separate browser window):

<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_twin_portals.gif"  height=190 width=380></center>
<p>The arrows indicate which way the portal faces.&nbsp; The shaded node
is the node the portal is attached to.
<p>When a polygon is inserted that is inside 2 or more bsp nodes, it gets
split into several pieces such that each piece is in a single node.&nbsp;
However, qbsp3 will later to try to merge faces with identical properties
together if possible (so you may have a single polygon attached to multiple
bsp nodes), so you often wont see evidence of this effect if you turn on
gl_showtris (see discussion of gl_showtris below).
<p>The following is a 3d representation of this map in Quake II:
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_quake2view2.jpg" ></center>
<p>The thin semi-transparent windows represent the portals which you can't
normally see.
<p><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/q3a.jpg" HSPACE=5 align=LEFT>Unlike qbsp3
which breaks up polygons to fit into polygon nodes, then tries to merge
them again later, q3map for Quake 3 Arena leaves polygons unbroken, and
makes no attempt to merge later.&nbsp; The ultimate effect is roughly the
same.&nbsp; The bsp tree itself is still built as normal.
<p>

<br><a NAME=VisibilityNodes></a>(<a href="/node/266#TOC">Table of
Contents</a>)
<h3>
VISIBILITY NODES</h3>
Lets take the following possible final bsp arrangement (from one of the
example bsp-ings above):
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_final1.gif" ></center>
<p>As mentioned above, each of the white areas is a bsp node.&nbsp; These
bsp nodes are also used for visibility determination.&nbsp; Qvis3 goes
through and determines which nodes are visible from which nodes.&nbsp;
Lets take the following 2 points, one being an observer, another being
a point on a wall that is being looked at:
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_view1.gif"></center>

<p>As you can see by the red line, the two points are not visible too each
other.&nbsp; However, with this bsp, qvis3 (and thus Quake II) will think
they are.&nbsp; Why is this?&nbsp; Because the nodes they are in are visible
to each other.&nbsp; Qvis3, when checking for visibility, checks each portal
against each other portal.&nbsp; If it finds 2 portals that can see each
other, then the 2 bsp nodes they are part of can see each other.&nbsp;
In the following image, the portals currently being looked at are marked
in yellow.
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_portal1.gif"></center>
<p>Since they can see each other (1 of the infinite number of possible
lines of sight is marked in a dashed red line), the bsp nodes the black
dots are in can see each other.&nbsp; This means that as far as qvis3 and
Quake II are concerned, the observer can see the point on the wall.

<p>This, by the way, is where the infamous "Leaf portals saw into leaf"
warning comes from.&nbsp; When this happens, it means it tried comparing
2 leaf portals that belongs to the same visibility node.&nbsp; There was
a nasty bug in the original qbsp3 (yes, qbsp3.&nbsp; It wrote out a bad
bsp that qvis3 had problems with) that resulted in seeing this error often.&nbsp;
Seeing it often meant that there were serious problems with the map.&nbsp;
However, a number of rewritten qbsp3's fixed this problem.&nbsp; In the
<a href="/node/266#Files">files</a>
section below is a link to my <a href="/node/266#Files">gddqbsp3</a> which has this
fix.&nbsp; Even with fixed qbsp3's, you may still see the warning.&nbsp;

Take a look at the following:
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_leaferror.gif" height=190 width=380></center>
<p>The red and yellow portals were originally 1 portal that got split into
2.&nbsp; Normally, qvis3 takes steps to prevent unnecessary portals from
being checked against each other, but this can fail.&nbsp; Both the shown
portals should lie on the same plane, but due to limitations of floating
point numbers as they are represented in computers, they may be slightly
bent with respect towards each other (by a real small amount you could
never hope to see with the naked eye).&nbsp; If this happens, and they
bent in a concave fashion, you will get this error.&nbsp; The following
picture shows what this looks like (if this image is not animating, reload
the page and don't stop the loading of the page, or open image up in a
separate browser window):
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_leaferroranim.gif" height=190 width=380></center>
<p>The angles are highly exaggerated.&nbsp; The dashed line shows how the
node saw itself.&nbsp; In this situation, the warning is harmless.&nbsp;

There are several other similar situations where you might see this warning,
all the result of a computer's finite precision floating point math.&nbsp;
If you have a fixed qbsp3, do not worry about this warning.
<p>If the portal in question is axial, this should not happen.
<p>

<br><a NAME=CheckingVisibility></a>(<a href="/node/266#TOC">Table
of Contents</a>)
<h3>
CHECKING VISIBILITY</h3>
So you have your map up and running and want to see how visibility worked
out where you have speed problems.&nbsp; The primary way of doing this
is using one of the OpenGL rendering modes, then setting gl_showtris 1.
Take the following view from base64 (deathmatch compilation of base1, base2,
and base3 from the single player game):
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/notris.jpg" ALT="gl_showtris 0"></center>

<p>And now with gl_showtris 1:
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/tris.jpg" ALT="gl_showtris 1"></center>
<p>This shows us that Quake II believes that a lot of polygons are visible
when they really are not.&nbsp; It is showing all the polygons in all currently
visible nodes.&nbsp; In case you are wondering, I removed the player weapon
by typing "hand 2" at the console.
<p>The triangles are not part of the bsp.&nbsp; When polygons are rendered,
they get broken up into triangles in the engine.
<p><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/warning.jpg" HSPACE=5 align=LEFT>In either
Quake II or Quake 3 Arena, it is possible to have polygons cross node boundaries.&nbsp;
Thus gl_showtris is not useful for showing where your portals are.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
3Dfx Cards</h3>

The 3dfx minidriver does not support gl_showtris.&nbsp; You can use the
default OpenGL drivers, but if you are using the software OpenGL (Microsoft's
or SGI's), it will be really slow, and possibly somewhat unstable.&nbsp;
You can also load the MesaGL driver for 3dfx cards.&nbsp; A link to these
drivers can be found in the <a href="/node/266#Files">files</a> section below.&nbsp;
Once you have the drivers, put it in your Quake II directory (DO NOT put
it into your system/system32 directory).&nbsp; Make sure it is named opengl32.dll
if it isn't already.&nbsp; Now when you use default opengl drivers, it
will use the Mesa drivers (which the above screenshot was taken with).
<p><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/warning.jpg" HSPACE=5 align=LEFT>This data
was acquired in early 1999.&nbsp; Later versions of MesaGL may not support
gl_showtris.&nbsp; However later versions of 3dfx's drivers might.

Still Not Seeing Triangles?</h3>
If you do not see triangles, you may need to issue the following commands
at the console:
<p>gl_ext_multitexture 0
<br>vid_restart
<p>As this may involve performance degradation, you will want to do the
following when done using gl_showtris:
<p>gl_ext_multitexture 1

HINT BRUSHES</h3>
In the example bsp, there are only 4 pairs of bsp nodes that are not visible
to each other (shown marked below):
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_nonvis1.gif"></center>
<p>There are 21 possible pairs of bsp nodes, only 4 of which are hidden
from each other. This is not good.&nbsp; It will result in problems similar
to above in the base64 map.&nbsp; The base64 scene above is actually not
too bad but you can get more extreme examples where you may be drawing
the same part of the screen 3, 4, 5, or more times.&nbsp; In the original
Quake, mappers were forces to go through various games to keep visibility
reasonable.&nbsp; Fortunately, Quake II gives us a tool with which we can
control bsp-splits: the hint texture.&nbsp; What does the hint texture
do?&nbsp; The hint texture is a texture that forces a bsp split even though
the hint texture is not visible.&nbsp; Another feature of the hint texture
is that qbsp3 will not chose a polygon insertion order that will result
in a non-hint polygon splitting a hint polygon.

<p>The hint texture is typically used in conjunction with the skip texture.&nbsp;
The skip texture polygons are not inserted into the bsp-tree and thus,
not used by Quake II.&nbsp; The idea is to take a brush, apply the skip
texture, then apply to a single side of the brush the hint texture.&nbsp;
This will result in a single hint polygon inserted where the brush is,
which is generally all that is necessary.&nbsp; However, you can use an
entire hint brush, but this will make the bsp-splits a bit more complicated.
<p>When you lay out your hint planes, you have to place them such that
two areas you intend to keep hidden from each other don't have the hint
planes facing each other.&nbsp; For the example map, we will try a grid
as follows:
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_myhints.gif"></center>
<p>In an editor (this particular shot came from Qeradiant), it will look
something like this (except for the inset):
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_quake2hint.jpg"></center>
<p>The inset shows the area at the base of the line from another angle.&nbsp;

These brushes all have 5 skip faces, and 1 hint face.&nbsp; The skip faces
are completely ignored, only the hint faces are processed.&nbsp; We could
reduce the number of hint/skip brushes down to as few as 3 by using more
than one hint face per brush but for this example, we will use 1 hint face
per brush (for one thing, by keeping the brushes thin, they don't clutter
up the view in the editor as much).
<p>The 2 points we used above are still going to be visible to each other
as the new nodes they will be in will still be visible to each other:
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_portal2.gif"></center>
<p>However, there are more areas hidden from each other.&nbsp; None of
the areas marked with the same letter will be visible to each other. There
are additional areas not visible to each other (for example, the nodes
in each set of opposite corners) which would have made the diagram too
complex and confusing if completely listed.&nbsp; Visibility will never
be perfect. At any given point in your level, there will be parts of your
level that are not visible but will get drawn anyway (with a few exceptions
like facing an outside wall with nothing behind it).
<p>It will take some trial and error to get a feel for what works well.
Deciding where to place hint planes can be something of an art form.&nbsp;
One good use for hint brushes is in hallway bends as follows:
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_hall1.gif"></center>
<p>You can keep people from seeing too far around the bend by laying a
hint brush across the corner like this:

<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_hall2.gif"></center>
<p>This way you make sure you can only see down both hallways at once if
you are in the corner.
<p><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/warning.jpg" HSPACE=5 align=LEFT>One thing
you have to watch for is that the hint brush must make contact with all
edges.&nbsp; Otherwise, if qbsp3 puts a split plane between a surface and
your hint brush, you are not going to get the results you expect.&nbsp;
You may want to even extend them into the adjacent surfaces slightly.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/warning.jpg" HSPACE=5 align=LEFT>It is
possible for portals lying on the same plane to cause problems.&nbsp; We
can trust that nodes of the same letter in the above example are not visible
to each other in spite of the fact they share portals on the same plane
because they are axial, but look at the following 2 nodes:
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_nonvis2.gif"></center>
<p>The portals on the planes shared by both shaded nodes are not axial.&nbsp;
As a result, slight numerical errors due to the limits of the floating
point unit on your CPU may cause them to be visible to each other after
all as shown:
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_unaligned.gif" height=190 width=380></center>
<p>The angle of error shown here is extremely exaggerated.&nbsp; When forcing
a split on a non-axial plane, a single hint plane may not be enough.&nbsp;

You may want to use a double sided hint brush about 8 or 16 units, with
the ideal portal running through the middle as follows:
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_double.gif"></center>
<p>The red/yellow/black striped lines are the hint brushes.&nbsp; The 2
red parts on the edges would be the hint surfaces of the hint brush, the
rest of the surfaces of the hint brush would be marked as "skip".&nbsp;
The black line running down the center is where the original portal was.&nbsp;
This will trap any errors between the two planes.&nbsp; You can use either
2 hint brushes, or opposite sides of the same thin hint brush.&nbsp; This
is only necessary when you care about how 2 or more portals that lie on
the same plane interact with each other.
<p>In addition to placing hint brushes where you want portals, you can
place them in the void or in geometry to separate parts of the level from
each other.&nbsp; For example, if your map consists of 2 separate parts
connected only by teleporters, putting a huge hint brush (such that you
cannot connect any 2 points, one from each part, without going through
it) between the 2 parts will keep brushes in either part (except for other
hint brushes) from causing bsp splits, etc., in the other.
<p><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/warning.jpg" HSPACE=5 align=LEFT>In reality,
due to either face merging in Quake II, or not being split in the first
place in Quake 3 Arena, the polygons on the perimeter would span multiple
nodes, and if a polygon is visible in any of the nodes, it is completely
visible.&nbsp; In this example, it would make hint brushes practically
useless.&nbsp; In a real map, with a much higher density of polygons per
major area you want to partition off, this is hardly a problem.

<p><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/warning.jpg" HSPACE=5 align=LEFT>It may
be tempting to break up your map into a bunch of real tiny areas with hint
brushes but while this will certain help visibility, this will greatly
increase the amount of time qvis3 takes to run, and you will probably run
afoul of the 1 megabyte limit for the map's visibility data (see section
on detail brushes below for more information on how to reduce visibility
complexity).&nbsp; You generally want to take steps only when you have
speed problems.&nbsp; Often the level geometry itself will be sufficient.

3 Arena has a skip texture, but it does not work.&nbsp; In fact, due to
the way q3map processes the map, this cannot be represented at all.&nbsp;
The entire brush will have to be a hint brush.

Quake 3 Arena, hint brushes do not get preferential treatment when being
inserted into the bsp tree.&nbsp; This means that hint brushes can only
be used to create portals,&nbsp; The tip above about separating map parts
will not work.

<h3>
DETAIL BRUSHES</h3>
Lets take our previous map, and add a few small brushes.&nbsp; The final
bsp might look something like this:
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_splits.gif"></center>
<p>As you can see, the number of bsp nodes has increased from 7 to 13.&nbsp;
The number of nodes to run bsp calculations has almost doubled and will
cause the size of the visibility information to nearly quadruple.&nbsp;
However, the new brushes do practically nothing to block visibility, making
the visibility information needlessly complex.&nbsp; In the original Quake,
this was a fact of life you pretty much had to live with.&nbsp; With Quake
II, like the hint texture above, we get a tool to help us out: the detail
brush.&nbsp; Unlike the hint texture, which is applied to individual brush
faces, detail is a property that applies to the entire brush.

<p>What happens with detail brushes, is that the polygons making it up
are inserted into the bsp tree last.&nbsp; Additionally, when detail brush
polygons are inserted, they do not create portals, and the bsp nodes they
cut up are treated as one single visibility node.&nbsp; Lets make the 3
triangular brushes detail brushes.&nbsp; Then we will end up with something
like:
<p><center><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/bsp_detail.gif"></center>
<p>The dashed lines are bsp splits, but do not contain portals.&nbsp; Qvis3
treats the entire shaded area as a single node for visibility calculations.&nbsp;
This greatly simplifies the qvis3 process and makes it a lot faster.&nbsp;
When deciding if a brush should be a detail brush or not, you should pick
those that look like that could be seen around easily.&nbsp; Good candidates
for this are things like beams, light fixtures, computer terminals, pretty
much anything small that doesn't do a good job of blocking visibility.&nbsp;

This can be tricky and will some take some trial and error to get a good
feel for.&nbsp; You will want to use gl_showtris mention above as an aid
to this process.
<p><img SRC="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/warning.jpg" HSPACE=5 align=LEFT>Make sure
all sides of your detail brush are either detail or structural.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If this is not the case, you will get mixed face contents warnings.&nbsp;
If your editor has an option to make a brush structural or detail, you
may want to use that instead of using the editor's surface properties dialog
box.

brushes work differently in Quake 3 Arena then they do in Quake II.&nbsp;
They are still used in the same situations, but hidden sides are not removed
by CSG operations.&nbsp; This means that you will have to remove them manually
by applying the "caulk" texture to all hidden surfaces to keep unnecessary
drawing down.

DETAIL HINT BRUSHES</h3>
Detail hint brushes are not part of id's original compiling utilities.&nbsp;
If you are using those, you will not be able to use this feature.&nbsp;
In my <a href="#Files">gddqbsp3</a> (see <a href="#Files">files</a> section
below), they are implemented such they are hint brushes that only affect
detail brushes.&nbsp; They were primarily implemented as an aid to terrain
generators to keep detail brush based rolling terrain from cutting itself
up.&nbsp; <a href="#Files">Gensurf</a> (see <a href="#Files">files</a>

		Timing in Quake 2 - <a href="mailto:demolisherfx@usa.net">DemolisherFX</a>
	</blockquote>

<br><br><b>TECHNIQUE #1</b>: 

<p>I've played a few quake2 maps and haven't seen any timing implemented. People just use direct triggers in their maps. 

<p>I will tell you in this tutorial how to implement timing using two techniques that I have perfected. 

<p>First of all lets start of with the simple way. Now lets say you have a room with four lights in it and you want the second to turn on 1 second after the first, the third 1 second after the second, and so on. 

<p>On top of this you want them triggered with one switch. Now a trigger_relay has no delay build in so you have to use something else. Most of you probably don't know this but a trigger_multiple has a targetname for a reason. The obvious reason is that it can be triggers both when the player walks in or if it is triggered by another event. 

<p>As for the lights lets create a small room with four light. Give each light a different targetname: Light1 for the first, light2 for the second, and so on. 

<p>Now create a button or trigger that will turn on the light. Give the button or trigger a target of start. 

<p>Now create a very small brush, make it a trigger_multiple, and place it at the upper left corner of both the top and back view. The placement is not necessary but you want to have the triggers out of reach so the player doesn't trip them accidentally. 

<p>Now give the trigger_multiple a targetname of start and a target of light1. You can use the delay field to choose when you want the first light to turn on. 

<p>Create 3 more trigger_multiple for the rest of the lights and follow the step above. Just set different delays for them and then you got four independent lights turned on at different times.


<br><br><br><b>TECHNIQUE #2</b>: 

<p>This is not really necessary but this way is good if you don't expect to use the triggers twice. 

<p>The technique is almost the same. The first step is to create a room with 4 lights with different targetnames. Also create a button or trigger that will turn on the lights and give it a target of start. 

<p>The second step is to create a func_timer with a targetname of start and a target of start1. 

<p>The third step is to create a trigger_count with a targetname of start1 and a target that point to the first light. I don't think it matters where you put a func_timer. 

<p>Don't forget that the counters themselves don't have a delay but you can set a wait time for the func_timer. Lets say its 1. 

<p>Now follow the third step for the rest of the lights that need to be triggered. You have to give the trigger_count for the first light a count of 1 and for the second a count of 2, and so on for all the lights. 

<p>What this does that each light will be triggered every value of second that you put for the wait field in the func_timer. As for this func_timer there is a wait of 1, so the first light will tun on instantly. The second one in one second. The third in two and so on. 

<p>That should be it. I think this will broaden the range of effects that could be created in quake2. 

<p>If you find a better way for timing without coding anything please email me at DemolisherFX@usa.net or jmario1002@hotmail.com.

<br><br>	

 <p><b>turret_breach</b>, <b>turret_base</b>, and <b>turret_driver</b> all must be 
	used together to create those cool gun turrets that are in 2 of the quake2 
	levels. These entities are by far the hardest I have come across to use in a 
	level and only advanced level editors should attempt this. I would of never of 
	figured it out if it wasn't for steve at the 
	<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/QuakeLab/QuakeLab2/"><b>quakelab</b></a> 
	telling me to specify an origin for the turret_breach and turret_base. We will 
	get to that though in due time.</p>

 <p>The first thing you need to do is to <b>create the gun</b>. This might take 
	awhile to make it look good. Here is a shot of the id one:</p>

<center>
	<img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/turret/gunpic1.JPG" width="250" height="143" border="0" alt="gunpic">
</center>

 <p>You must also make everything <b>orientated towards angle 0</b>(straight right 
	from a top view), The trick is to kind of <b>make it into 2 parts. The barrel 
	and the base.</b> the barrel is the part that is going to be the turret_breach 
	and the base is going to be the turret_base. Also take into consideration that 
	the creature driving the gun will be standing on the turret_breach so actually 
	<b>the turret_breach will include the barrel and the platform that the 
	turret_driver will be standing on.</b> Here is another visual example to show you
	what the hell I am talking about:</p>

<center>
	Here is the barrel which includes the barrel and the platform for the driver to 
	stand on(<b>turret_breach</b>):<br>
	<img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/turret/barrel.jpg" width="250" height="52" border="0" alt="barrel"><br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Here is the base(<b>turret_base</b>):<br>
	<img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/turret/base.JPG" width="250" height="146" border="0" alt="turret_base"><br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Here is the barrel(<b>turret_breach</b>) and the base(<b>turret_base</b>) 
	together:<br>
	<img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/turret/both.jpg" width="250" height="70" border="0" alt="turret_breach and turret_base">
</center>

 <p>Once you get these 2 parts made then you must <b>select the barrel and make it a 
	turret_breach, and select the base and make it a turret_base.</b> Now you must 
	<b>give the turret_breach a targetname</b>. So for this example lets give it a 
	targetname of breach. <b>targetname=breach</b>. The turret_breach and the 
	turret_base go together so <b>they must be teamed</b>. To do this give each of 
	these entities the key value pair <b>team</b> with the same value. For this 
	example lets give them a team name of gun. So on <b>both</b> the turret_breach 
	and the turret_base there should be a key value pair of <b>team gun</b> Now you 
	must decide which direction you want your gun to point in the game and <b>set the
	key value pair angle to what ever direction you want the gun to point.</b> 
	<b>BOTH</b> the turret_breach and the turret_base should have the same angle. For
	this example we will set the angle to be 180. <b>angle 180</b>.</p>

 <p>Next thing you must do is create the target that the gun will shoot at. To do 
	this you must <b>create an info_notnull entity and place it at the tip of the 
	barrel and give it a targetname.</b> For this example our info_notnull will have 
	a targetname of tip. <b>targetname tip</b>. Then <b>set the target of the 
	turret_breach to the info_notnull</b>. <b><b>target=tip</b></b>.</p>

 <p>Next thing you need to do is to <b>create the turret_driver and target it to the 
	turret_breach.</b> target=breach. Place the turret_drive where you want him to be
	standing(on the platform you made him on the turret_breach).</p>

 <p>Now to the part that I couldn't figure out but steve at the 
	<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/quakelab/quakelab2/">quakelab</a> helped me 
	out on. For the turret_breach and the turret_base <b>you must have a brush set as
	an origin brush</b>. These will keep gun from rotating all around the room and 
	looking really messed up. So the turret_breach <b>must</b> have an origin brush 
	and the turret_base <b>must</b> have an origin brush. To make a brush an origin 
	brush you must <b>change the surface property</b> of that brush and set the 
	origin flag. This is done differently for each editor. Check your manual. It is 
	better to select origin brushes that for breach and the base that are near each 
	other. Here is a diagram of what brushes i made into origin brushes.</p>

	entity to use. Not very fun at all. I urge you to download my

	<blockquote>
		Using Clip Brushes - <a href="mailto:dmm2editor@aol.com">Richard Neff</a> and <a href="mailto:rascal@magnolia.net">David Hyde</a>
	</blockquote>
	
<br><br>

<p>One of the signs of a quality map maker for any game is creating maps that do two things:

<ul>
<li>Create visually exciting areas for the player 
<li>Create a level that is interesting to play 
</ul>

<p>This tutorial is going to concentrate on the latter concept.  More precisely, the use of Clip brushes to help keep the player from being "snagged" on small brushes used to help with the first concept above.

<br><br><b>"Oh no! I'm stuck"</b>

<p>One of the things you'll notice if you fire up any of Id Software's original Quake 2 levels, is that there are a lot of columns and uneven surfaces running along walls.   This creates an exciting visual impact, however, you should notice that the player can run along those walls backwards and not stop until they reach another wall.

<p>To be more precise, let's look at the following screenshot from one of those levels, base1.bsp (the first level in single player.)

<p><div align="center"><img border="0" width="450"  src="/content/quake2/tutorials/clip/clip_img1.jpg"></div>

<p>Towards the end of the level, you'll see this wall near the stairs.  Note that there are both columns and light fixtures running along this wall.  Yet, if you press yourself against this wall and run all the way to the next wall, you don't get "snagged."  A <b>very</b> useful thing when you're being pursued by a Quake 2 monster, or worse yet, a real live Deathmatch opponent!

<br><br><b>So, how is this done?</b>

<p>Ok, the answer is pretty obvious given the title - It was done using Clip brushes.   But, in this tutorial we'll look at the two methods of using Clip brushes to keep players from being "snagged" while playing your levels.

<p>Clip brushes themselves are pretty easy to create.  Simply create a brush with the Clip texture on all sides of the brush.  It's totally invisible in the game and it won't have any effect on the poly count (r_speeds) of the level.   Essentially, they're like invisible "force fields" that prevent the player from getting to an area (useful for more than "snagging" problems also.) Some editors may require that you manually specify the Clip content property, but most will automatically create the Clip brush.  If you run your map and see the Clip texture, then you probably haven't applied that texture to all sides of the brush.

<br><br><b>The Two Techniques</b>

<p>Truthfully, none of this is rocket science - it's pretty straightforward.   However, there are two ways to handle not getting "snagged."   Consider the image above showing base1.bsp.  One way to help the player from getting snagged is to put an angled brush on both sides of the columns or lights.   For example, here's a screenshot in my editor of a light fixture that hangs on a wall:

<p><div align="center"><img border="0" width="450"  src="/content/quake2/tutorials/clip/clip_img2.jpg"></div>

<p>In this example, you'll notice that the clip brushes on each side are designed to gently let the player get around the protruding light fixture by forcing them along an angle between the wall and the fixture itself.  The slope of the angle is something you sometimes have to work with, but typically a 45 degree angle between perpendicular surfaces works well.

<p>So, what's the drawback to this method?  Two primary drawbacks come to mind.   One involves the player, the other often involves you, the editor.  First, if a player is running on the surface of a such a wall, their direction will change slightly.   For those players that like to run backwards against a wall while firing, this will affect those shots when the light fixture is hit.  And, as well all know, this could mean life or death in a deathmatch game!

<p>The next drawback is with editing.  If you wanted to do this along a wall with a lot of columns or light fixtures, you'd have to create 2 clip brushes for each object that protrudes from that wall.  Needless to say, this makes an already tedious process more painstaking!  So, this method is best used for any light fixtures or the like that you've created as a prefab in your editor.

<p>So, what's the easiest way to handle a wall like the base1.bsp figure that won't take a lot of time to create, yet still allow the player good movement along the wall?  The answer is actually quite simple -- make a Clip brush that covers all the protruding objects along that wall. (And what Id actually did in that particular area.)

<p>Here's some screenshots to help you out:

<p>In this figure, here's a room with some columns

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/clip/clip_img3.jpg"></div>

<p>If the player were to run along the wall on the right, they'd get snagged on every column and I'd need to make 6 total clip brushes using the first technique.

<p>However, if I make the Clip brush (the red box) like so:

<p><div align="center"><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/clip/clip_img4.jpg"></div>

<p>Then, the player will run along the entire wall without getting snagged or being moved.   Plus, the added benefit to the level maker is that it is a much simpler job to create 1 rectangular brush than 6 triangular ones!

<p>So, why not use this method all the time?  Well, one word -- doors.  If we had a door on the right side we couldn't have the Clip brush covering the door, the player would never be able to pass through the door.  In this case, a combination of the above methods would need to be used.

<br><br><b>Pretty Simple Huh?</b>

<p>Well, that's pretty much the main points about Clip brushes.  See, that wasn't very hard, was it?  However, putting Clip brushes in your level will make a big difference for those people playing your maps (especially if you're designing DM or CTF maps.)  So, it's worth the extra time placing Clip brushes in your level.

<blockquote>by Ricebug</blockquote>

<p>You've been working on this huge map and have just discovered
that about a thousand brushes need the <i>detail</i> property applied to them.
This job would be tedious in the best of
circumstances, not to mention the possibility of missing a few brushes.&nbsp; Or let's
say you need to change all the _focus values for a certain light entity. Those
mine lights are a bitch to select due to their size. Again, an exercise in
tedium.</p>

<p>Lucky for us, the standard .map format is nothing more than
simple ASCII---in other words, plain English. So opening it up in a text editor
provides us with the ability to use the <i>Search &amp; Replace</i> functions to
do sweeping changes in a map, thus removing the drudgery. Doing so requires some
preparation, however.</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">1. Back up the map file! There's nothing worse than destroying a
map with the click of a mouse.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">2. Get a text editor. I'd recommend <a href="http://www.jgsoft.com/"><b>EditPad</b></a>.
It's free, it will do operations on multiple files, and will not contaminate the
map file with unnecessary (and fatal) characters. If you like more muscle, <a href="http://www.idmcomp.com/index.html"><b>UltraEdit32</b></a>
is also a good choice. Do not use Windows' <i>Notepad.</i> It has the nasty
habit of inserting or deleting carriage returns. Besides, it has a limited
filesize buffer. Same for any high-end word processor. Unless you really
understand the different .txt formats, (there are 4) it's safer to use EditPad.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">3. If you're using a map editor that saves its maps in a
proprietary format, such as WorldCraft or QOOLE, you'll have to export the map
as a <i>.map</i> file. Once the changes have been made, you can then re-load the
repaired map and press on.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">This is all the info describing a 64<sup>3</sup> brush with the <b>c_met11_2</b>

texture applied to it. If you care to check, one corner of this brush sits at
the center of the world (0 0 0). Imagine having to construct an entire map using
a text editor! Believe it or not, the first CAD programs were done exactly in
this manner. Lucky for the users, they only had to worry about drawing a 2-dimensional world.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">What we're really interested in are the numbers following the

first line would be <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF">0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0</span>.
These are all of the texture values and spawnflags. The fact that there are
mostly zeros means the texture has no surface or content flags set for it; it's
just a plain old texture. The two 1's are the texture's dimensions, which mean
that it has been applied with it's default size.&nbsp;</font></p>

100</span></font> means that you've get a light value of 100. However, since the
light flag is normally set for a situation like this, it would read <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF"><font color="#000000">0
0 0 1 1 0 1 100.</font></span> Reason being, is that 'light' is the first item
in the surface property list, and therefore has a spawnflag value of '1'.
'Slick' is '2', sky is '4' and so on, following the numerical convention used
for spawnflags. Here's a handy reference showing all of the spawnflags:</font></p>

Some suggestions:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In some map editors, applying the ladder flag can be a tedious process.
Suppose your ladder is using a texture named <b>eggwhite</b>. Open the map in

property spawnflag total of light (1) + sky (4) + nodraw (128). The '50' at the
end is the light value I applied to the sky texture. Since 100 would give me
better results, changing this last number via EditPad on all sky brushes would
be a piece of cake.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">I had a large warehouse whose ceiling used a light-emitting

<h3 align="left"><font face="Arial">A Note Concerning Non-Radiant Editors</font></h3>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Mad Dog had some input on this issue which is relevant to
Worldcraft, QOOLE, and QuArk users. If you're thinking of replacing textures
globally with new properties using a text editor, do not export not the entire
map as a .map.&nbsp; Instead, first determine which groups are affected, and
then export each group<br>

individually as a separate .map. Then, after changing things, copy the contents
of each of those new &quot;maplets&quot; into your primary map, make each a new
group, and replace each old group with the new ones. That way the grouping is
preserved.</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Map making should be fun and not tedious. Hopefully, I've
enlightened you on how to be more productive in your endeavors and put the fun
back into creating those worlds.&nbsp;</font></p>

	<a name="func_areaportal"><h3>func_areaportal</h3></a>

<hr color=black noshade width=75%>	

	<p>A <b>func_areaportal</b> is a strange entity but does some bad ass things. If you have done any extensive quake editing then you know that the quake engine can see right through a door and draws all the polys beyond that door. This causes the framerate to increase and cause map makers much havoc. Well in quake2, John Carmack has given us a solution to this problem and it's the func_areaportal entity. What it actually does is when used it will make it so the engine cannot see through the door and keeps the framerate low. I could go into a bunch of tech talk explaining exactly what it does but you don't want to hear all of that and I really don't want to type it all so I will simply tell you how to use it.<br><br>
	
	<b>How it works</b><br>A <b>func_areaportal</b> will only work when it <b>is enclosed within a portal such as a door</b>. It is actually very simple to use. First you make the doors of course. Then you create a brush that is enclosed within the door and completely covers the area of the door so engine can't see through it at any areas. What I usually do is make it just a bit taller and wider then the door just to make sure. Next thing you need to do is turn this brush into a <b>func_areaportal</b>.<br><br>
	
	<b>Next you need to link the func_areaportal and the door so that when the door is opened the func_areaportal will disappear and when it is closes it will reappear</b>. This is done by giving the func_areaportal a targetname and then targeting the func_areaportal with the door. For example, if the func_areaportal has a targetname of ap1, <b>targetname ap1</b>, then the func_door would have a target of ap1. <b>target ap1</b>. If you don't target the func_areaportal then you will get this weird hall of mirrors effect when the door is opened.<br><br>
	
	Here are 2 example shot of that i took to show you the effect of using the func_areaportal does. The shots are from the doors tutorial example map with and without using area_portals. I simply turned on r_speeds right when the player enters the level and is standing in front of a hallway with 4 doors in it. <br><br>

	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>
	
	<p>As you can see there is a huge difference with that first number which is the number of polys in the current view. This is from a small simple level. Just think of the improvements that could be made on a huge level.<br><br>

	<p><b><a href="/content/quake2/entity/samples/func_button.zip">Download Sample Map</a></b><br><br>
	
	<a name="func_button"></a><h3>func_button</h3><p><hr color=black noshade width=75%><p>The <b>func_button</b> entity is a very simple entity that is used for for triggering other entities such as doors to open, platforms to rise, etc, etc. In many ways it acts like a regular trigger_ entity but there are a few more options and differences that you may notice.<br><br>
	
	<b>Creating the func_button</b><br>First thing you need to do is create the brush/brushes that will be the func_button and then turn it into a func_button. Pretty straight forward and simple.<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%><p><br><br>
	
	<b>Key Value Pairs</b><br>
	
	<b>Angle</b> - Angle determines the direction that the button will move when it is pressed. In most cases you will set the angle towards the wall that the func_button is up against to give the impression that it is being pressed into the wall. There are also cases in which you would have the angle set differently then towards the wall that it is up against. For example: You could have a button on the floor that the player would step on to trigger. Another advanced use of the angle key is for creating a lever. This would just be made by creating a thin lever shaped brush that has the angle set parallel to the wall.<br><br>
	
	<b>Target</b> - It should be set to the corresponding targetname that the func_button will trigger. A func_button MUST have a target or it would be useless.<br><br>
	
	<b>Targetname</b> - A targetname on a func_button is very strange, but it still works fine and can be useful. When a func_button has a targetname and is triggered the button will be set off just like it was pushed by the player, setting off it's own targets in the process.<br><br>
	
	<b>Speed</b> - Speed is pretty self explanatory. It determines the speed in which the button moves when it is pushed.<br><br>
	
	<b>Wait</b> - Wait is the amount of time that the button will pause before becoming active again. If you don't want the button to return then set the wait to -1.<br><br>
	
	<b>Lip</b> - Lip is the length of the button that is offset after being activated. So if you have a large lip value then more of the button will stick out after being pressed in.<br><br>
	
	<b>Health</b> - A value for health can be set if you want the button to be activated when shot. The button MUST be killed to be activated. Pushing it won't do anything after a value for health is set. The higher the value for health the more damage is needed to trigger it.<br><br>
	
	<b>Sounds</b> - The key value pair sounds works the same way for the func_button entity as it does for func_door and func_door_rotating:<br><br>
	
	1. There are no choices for different sounds, only one sound is available.<br><br>
	
	2. If you set this key to anything else than 1, you will always get the same standard button sound. If you set it to 1, you will have no sound.<br><br>So the "sound choices" list in the source code comments are outdated and probably just left over from Quake1. You do NOT have to use this key value pair unless you want your button to be silent.
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%><p><br><br>
	
	<b>Spawnflags</b><br>There are no spawnflags that are required or used for the func_button
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%><p><br><br>
	
	<b>Animated Textures</b><br>There are lots of animated textures that can be used for buttons. Animated textures are not something new but in Quake2, they behave a bit differently and this is one of it's coolest features. The best choice for these are 4 frame texture sets: To make a long story short, the button's face will toggle between the first 2 when idle and between the last 2 when pressed. Here's an example:<br><br>
	
	Suppose you make a button and apply the <b>e1u1/arrow0</b> texture, when the button is idle, the button face will cycle between the arrow0 and <b>arrow1</b> textures. While the button is pressed, the button face will cycle between the <b>arrow2</b> and <b>arrow3</b> textures.<br><br>
	
	This will work with all textures that follow one another in alphanumeric order and which end with the numbers <b>0 to 3</b>. If you use a set which has only 2 textures in a row in the list, the button face will cycle between these 2 textures <b>both</b> in the idle and pressed states. Note that if there are more that 4 textures in the set, the ones after 3 will simply <b>not</b> be used. For instance, there is a <b>e1u1/arrow4</b> in the last example: well, it is not used in the animation sequence. If you apply it to the button face, the texture will <b>not</b> be animated.<br><br>
	
	Also note that whether you apply the first, last or any other texture in the set makes no difference, the button face's texture will still be animated. If you use a 4 texture set, changing which one of the 4 you apply to the button face will change the sequence of which pair is displayed in the idle and pressed state. Let's pick up the previous example with a slight modification:<br><br>
	
	Also note that whether you apply the first, last or any other texture in the set makes no difference, the button face's texture will still be animated. If you use a 4 texture set, changing which one of the 4 you apply to the button face will change the sequence of which pair is displayed in the idle and pressed state.

	Most animated "4 frame sequence" textures usually look and operate better when you apply the <b>first</b> texture (no. 0) in the set to the button face but that's not a fixed rule. Experiment and see what works best for you.<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%><p><br><br>
	
	<b>Uses of the func_button</b><br>In most cases you are going to use the func_button for easy tasks such as opening a door or triggering a lift of some sort. Which is very simple. Just make the func_door or platform give it a targetname, then target it with the func_button.<br><br>
	
	There are also some more advanced uses of a func_button such as a platform or a lever. Remember that although it is called a func_button you can use it for anything that you want to use it for.<br><br>

<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>

<p>These entitys are probably the one that gave me the most trouble out of any of them. They are not easy to use(except for the target_explosion). The <b>func_clock</b> acts like a time of day clock and in most instances it will be used with a <b>target_character</b> and <b>target_string</b>. It was used in the biggun level and the last level where you have to escape before in a certain amount of time.<br><br>
	
	In this example we will make a button that you press and it will make a counter appear on the wall that will count down from 10 and when it gets to 0 then the room will explode killing you and everything else..<br><br>
	
	The <b>first</b> thing you need to do is make a somewhat small room and put a player_start and a light in it.<br><br>
	
	Next you need to create a <b>func_clock</b> entity. You can put this entity anywhere you want. It will not show up in the level. This will control the clock. The key value pairs that you can set are <b>count</b>, <b>pathtarget</b>, and <b>style</b>. count determines the amount of time that the func_clock will count. Pathtarget is the target that will be triggered once count runs out. Style is for the actual visual clock that we will explain later. There are 3 styles. 0(xx), 1(xx:xx), and 2(xx:xx:xx). In this example we are going to set <b>count</b> to 10 and we are going to use style 2. We also need to specify the <b>pathtarget which we will set to bang</b>. Pathtarget bang. This will be the targetname of the <b>target_explosion</b> that we will make later that will kill everything. Now set the target to string which will be the <b>target_string</b> that we will make next. Also give the func_clock a <b>targetname of clock</b> so we can use a button that we will make later to trigger it into action.<br><br>
	
	There is also a variety of spawnflags for the func_clock. They are <b>timer_up</b>, <b>timer_down</b>, <b>start_off</b>, and <b>multiuse</b>. <b>Timer_up</b> makes it so the counter will count up and <b>timer_down</b> makes it so the counter will count down. This is basically just for looks. It does'nt effect the outcome. <b>Start_off</b> should be set if the clock will be triggered into starting. If this is off then the func_clock will start when the level starts. <b>Multiuse</b> should always be on. I'm not sure what it does but I do know that I have never ran into any problems when I keep it on. For this example we will set the timer_down, start_off, and multiuse spawnflags.<br><br>
	
	The next thing we will do is make a <b>target_string</b> entity. It doesn't matter where this entity is placed either. It will not be shown. Give it a <b>targetname of string</b> so that the func_clock will be targeted to it. Also give it a <b>team key value pair of countdown</b>. team countdown. This is all you have to do for the target_string.<br><br>
	
	Now we need to make 8 small brushes 8x16 right next to each other. These will represent the 8 characters that will be used from the <b>style</b> key value pair that we set on the func_clock. xx:xx:xx<br><br>You then need to turn all of these 8 brushes into <b>target_strings</b>. There are 2 key value pairs that you can set. They are <b>count</b> and <b>team</b>. The count is the position of the string that this the brush is and the team is the team that the entity is on. So on all 8 of these target_strings the team needs to be countdown. The count must be different for each of the 8. The one on the far left needs to start with 1. count 1. and the one on the far right needs to be set to 8.<br><br>
	
	Now the tricky part that I could'nt figure out till EutecTic told me. Y<b>ou must have the texture of all these target_strings set to num_0 that is in the test.wal file</b>. If you don't have this texture set then the countdown will not be printed.<br><br>
	
	Now we have to make the func_button that will trigger the func_clock into action. Make a button on the wall and set the target of it to clock and the wait to -1 so you will not be able to press the button again.<br><br>
	
	Now we have to make the <b>func_button</b> that will trigger the func_clock into action. Make a button on the wall and set the target of it to clock and the <b>wait to -1</b> so you will not be able to press the button again.<br><br>
	
	The final thing we need to do is to make the explosion that will kill everything. For this we will use a <b>target_explosion</b>. What a target_explosion does is when triggered creates a visual explosion that can be set to do any amount of damage. There are 2 key value pairs that you can set. <b>Dmg</b> and <b>delay</b>. Dmg is the amount of damage the explosion will cause and delay is the amount of time after triggered that the explosion will take place. For this example we will put the target_explosion in the middle of the room and give it a targetname of bang and a damage of 10000. This extreme high value will make sure everything is dies when it is triggered. If you have a larger room or a huge level then you will need to use multiple target_explosions all with the same targetname. and we are done. Be sure to check out the example map.<br><br>
	
	You can also use a func_clock without the visual countdown, just don't create any target_strings. You still must have a target_character though. As you can see this is a somewhat difficult entity to master but can come in handy for quite a few things<br><br>

	<a name="func_door"><h3>func_door</h3></a>

<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>

<p>To me I think that doors are one of the hardest entities to master. There are just so many different options and uses for a door. Now doors have even more options since there are rotating doors in Quake2.<br><br>
	
	The First thing you need to do is make brushes that are going to make up the door and turn it into a func_door. Then you need to decide which way the door is going to open and <b>set the angle</b>. After you have done this your door will be in working order. As of now the door will open when you touch it. If you want to set it so that you have to set off a trigger to open it then just give your <b>func_door a targetname and target it with a trigger</b>.<br><br>
	
	There are a ton of key value pairs and spawnflags for func_doors that do a variety of cool things. We will go over all the spawnflags first. They are: <b>message</b>, <b>angle</b>, <b>health</b>, <b>speed</b>, <b>wait</b>, <b>lip</b>, <b>dmg</b>, and <b>sounds</b>. <b>Message</b> will print a message when the door is touched <b>ONLY</b> when it is triggered open. Message won't do anything if your func_door does'nt have a targetname. <b>Angle</b> is of course the opening direction. If <b>health</b> is set then the door must be shot to open. <b>Speed</b> determines how fast the door moves. <b>Wait</b> is the length of time between opening the door and when the door closes. If you never want the door to close then set wait=-1. <b>Lip</b> is the length remaining after the door opens. I get a lot of question asking for this. <b>dmg</b> is of course the amount of damage the door will give off when blocked by an entity like the player. Damn! I sure made that sound difficult. hehe. Sounds determines the sound the door with put out when opened. Choices are 1)<b>silent</b>, 2)<b>light</b>, 3)<b>medium</b>, 4)<b>heavy</b>.<br><br>
	
	The <b>spawnflags</b> that you can set for a func_door are: <b>start_on</b>, <b>crusher</b>, <b>nomonster</b>, and <b>toggle</b>. <b>Start_on</b> will make the door operate in reverse. So the door will be open and then close. By default when a door crushes you again a wall it will take off damage and then go back a bit and then take off damage again. If <b>crusher</b> is on then there won't be that little pause between trying to close again. It will just keep trying to close and crush you. No matter what, if crush is turned on or turned off a door will take off damage and eventually kill you. Crusher will just do it quicker. <b>nomonster</b> makes it so a creature can not open the door. By default a monster can open a door. <b>Toggle</b> will only make a difference when a door has a opened by a trigger. It makes it so it wait until triggered in both the opening position and the closing position.<br><br>

	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>
	
	<p>Those are all the different spawnflags and key value pairs that are available for a regular func_door.<br><br>

	<p><a name="func_door_rotating"></a><h3>func_door_rotating</h3>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>
	
	<p>Now to the amazing <b>func_door_rotating</b>. A func_door_rotating basically works the exact same way a normal door does except for a few minor things. A func_door_rotating <b>must</b> have an <b>origin brush</b> as part of the brush. This is the actual part that the door rotates around. So the first thing you have to do is make the brushes that will make up the func_door_rotating and the brush you want as the origin brush. Then select the brushes for the actual door and the origin brush and make them into func_door_rotating.<br><br>
	
	Next thing you have to do is <b>select the brush that is going to be the origin brush and change the surface property of this brush to an origin brush</b>. All the editors have different ways of setting the surface properties. Hit the 'S' key in BSP and Qed4. Alt T will do it for QOOLE. Check your editor documentation if you don't know.<br><br>
	
	There are also a few additional key value pairs and spawnflags for a rotating door that I will of course tell you about.<br><br>
	
	There is only 1 new key value pair called <b>distance</b>. Distance determines the degrees the rotating door will travel. So a distance of 90 will make the door rotate 90 degrees. There are also 3 new spawnflags. <b>reverse</b>, <b>x-axis</b>, and <b>y-axis</b>. <b>Reverse</b> will make the door rotate in the opposite direction. <b>X-axis</b> will make the door rotate along the x-axis and <b>y-axis</b> will make the door rotate along the y-axis. By default the door will rotate along the <b>z-axis</b> so there isn't a spawnflag for that. Everything else about a func_door_rotating is exactly like a regular door so to save me from typing all that over again like....just go up and read it there. =)<br><br>
	
	Now I am going to try to explain how to make a door that must have a key to be opened. This is kind of nasty.<br><br>
	
	First you need to make the door. I already explained all that. Next you need to give the door a <b>targetname and a message</b>. The message should be a message that tells what item the player needs to open the door. Now you must place a <b>trigger_key</b> somewhere. It really doesn't matter where. The <b>trigger_key</b> entity only has one key value pair...<b>item</b>. Set this to the name of the entity that is required to open the door. Now you must target the door with the <b>trigger_key</b>. Now here is the trick. The trigger_key entity must be triggered by another trigger to work. So you must make another trigger that will be targeted to the trigger_key. Kind of nasty huh? If you want the door to open only once and stay open then you should use a <b>trigger_once</b> entity and target the <b>trigger_key</b>. So therefore the trigger_key must also have a targetname.<br><br>
	
	<p><a name="func_door_secret"></a><h3>func_door_secret</h3>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>
	
	<p>The final type of door is a <b>func_door_secret</b>. These of course are the doors that usually look like walls and when you shoot them they slide forward or back and then to the side. I'm sure you've seen them before. They are actually pretty simple to use. First you need to make the door of course then make it into a func_door_secret entity. There are 3 key value pairs. <b>angle</b>, <b>dmg</b>, <b>wait</b>. <b>Angle</b> is the direction the door will slide open. <b>dmg</b> is the amount of damage the door will give off when the player blocks the progress of the door. <b>wait</b> is the duration of time that the door stays open before closing. There is also 4 spawnflags. <b>once_open</b>, <b>1st_left</b>, <b>1st_down</b>, and <b>always_shoot</b>. <b>open_once</b> makes the door open once...duh. <b>1st_left</b> makes the door move a small amount to the left and then go the angle of the door. <b>1st_down</b> does the same thing but it goes down instead of left. <b>Always_shoot</b> makes the door always open when shot even where the door is targeted to open my another trigger.<br><br>

	<p>This is a pretty easy entity to use. func_explosive is an object that when triggered explodes.<br><br>
	
	Just make the brush you wish to explode and make it into a func_explosive. Yep, thats it. If you want a visual explosion then you will have to set the <b>dmg=value</b>, value being the amount of radius damage. There are also <b>health</b> and <b>mass</b> key value pairs. Health determines the amount of damage the brush can take before exploding and mass determines the amount of rubble that is produced when the brush explodes. That's all there is to a func_explosive.<br><br>

	<p>A <b>func_object</b> is a pretty cool entity plus its easy to use. Its a object that when triggered falls down. There are no key value pairs that need to be set for the func_object except for the targetname. Just create the brush you want to fall, give it a targetname, and set the trigger_spawn spawnflag. To make it easier to understand for you beginners here is a pic of the func_object entity dialog box from BSP.<br><br>

	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>
	
	<p>A good way to use a func_object is to team it with a func_explosive. In the example map I made I created a column that when shot the base of it explodes and the top part falls to the ground. So the exploding part of the column would be the func_explosive and the top part that falls to the ground is the func_object. To get this to work all you have to do is give the func_object a target_name and set the target of the func_explosive to the func_object. Be sure to set the trigger_spawn spawnflag of the func_object though.<br><br>
	
	Another good example of a func_object and func_explosive is on the level biggun. After you kill the boss and stop the computer or whatever and your trying to escape the ceiling is falling down and explosions are going off, etc. Hope all this helps.<br><br>

I had already put on the tutorials page that the func_killbox did nothing, so this tutorial is here all because of him. <b>Thanks EutecTic</b>. This guy is good!<br><br>
	
	What the func_killbox does is kill everything inside of it. It is actually a pretty simple entity to use, but there is a trick to it that gave me all my problems.<br><br>
	
	The <b>first</b> thing you need to do is decide where you want the func_kill box and create the brush. If you want it to kill everyone in a room then you need to make sure that the box is covering that whole room or it will be at least hitting every entity. Once you get the brush the size you want it then make it into the func_killbox.<br><br>
	
	The <b>next</b> thing you need to do is give the <b>func_killbox a targetname</b>. This is the only key value pair that you will need. For this example lets just give it a targetname of die.<br><br>
	
	Now you must make the trigger that is going to set off the func_killbox. In this example lets make it a button on the wall. So create the button and make it into a func_button. G<b>ive the func_button a target of the func_killbox. target=die</b>. Now here is the trick that I was I couldn't figure out. <b>You must also give the trigger that will set off the func_kill box a pathtarget of the func_killbox</b>. So in this example we would give the func_button a key value pair pathtarget and set it to die. pathtarget=die.<br><br>
	
	Thats it for a func_killbox. Your probably laughing at me right now cause this one was so easy. =) I wouldn't have such a problem if there were more comments in the code.<br><br>

	<p><b>Introduction to Quake 2 platforms</b><br>
	
	Platforms in Quake 2 work pretty much the same as in Quake 1 with a few minor distinctions. Let's first take a look at what is unchanged and clarify a few things at the same time:<ul><li>Platforms can only be made to go up. IOW, their normal idle position is the lowered position unless they are targeted (more on this later).<li>Plats must be drawn in the raised position in the map editor so the lighting can be calculated properly by the compiling utility (Qrad3).<li>BUT, a platform will initially be drawn in the lowered position in the game unless it is targeted.</ul><br><br>
	
	Now, let's take a look at what has changed from Quake 1 to Quake 2 about platforms. Unfortunately, these differences are not really an improvement. IMO, it's quite the opposite, here's why:<br>
	
	<ul><li>In Quake 1, when you wanted a plat to start in the raised position, you simply set the "Plat Low Trigger" spawnflag (who knows why they called it that?). Once the plat was touched or triggered and brought down the first time, it would thereafter function like a normal platform.<li>In Quake 2, if you want the platform to start in the raised position, you have to target it with a trigger, independently of the state of the "Plat Low Trigger" spawnflag. If you set the spawnflag without targeting the plat, nothing will happen and it will just behave as a normal plat. IOW, the spawnflag is useless by itself. This is the first setback compared to Quake 1.<li>For platforms in Quake 1, you had 2 choices of sounds or no sound at all if you wanted them to be silent.<li>In Quake 2, platforms not only don't have any choice of sounds, but you can't even make them silent either. This is what I call "major setback No. 2" in platforms. Funny, I somehow expected more from Quake 2 plats than Quake 1 plats, not less!... Oh well...</ul><br><br>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>
	
	<p><b>Ok, how do I make these work? Do I use height and lip?</b><br>
	
	There are 2 basic ways to make and set platforms to operate exactly the way you want (that is within their basic limitations):<br><br>The first and most common way is to use the physical dimension of the brushes that are part of the platform to set it's up-down travel distance. In this particular case, the <b>height</b> key pair is not used but the <b>lip</b> key pair is and can be extremely useful. The basic setup formula in this case is as follows:<br><br>
	
	(Total platform height - <b>lip</b> value) = platform travel distance<br><br>
	
	<b>Total platform height:</b><br>
	
	This is the overall height of all the brushes that are part of the <b>func_plat</b> entity when measured from the <b>lowest</b> point to the <b>highest</b> point. You're probably thinking: hey! This definition is overkill. I could have figured that out for myself long ago! All I have to do is add up all the individual heights of all the brushes that are part of my plat and I'm in business right?... Well, as long as <b>none</b> of your brushes <b>overlap</b> heightwise. Otherwise, you'll have to <b>measure</b> the distance from the highest to the lowest point.<br><br>
	
	<b>Lip value:</b><br>
	
	The height or amount by which your platform will be raised from the floor when it's in the lowered position.<br><br>
	
	<center><img src="/content/quake2/entity/images/func_plat1.gif"><br>
	
	First method of evaluating platform travel</center><br><br>

<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>

<p>The second and easiest, most predictable way to set your platforms is to use the <b>height</b> key pair. In this case, the <b>physical dimensions</b> of the brushes that are part of the platform have no importance and the <b>lip</b> key pair has no effect and needs not be used. The basic setup formula is as simple as it gets:<br><br>
	
	<b>height</b> value = platform travel distance<br><br>
	
	I bet you're saying: what?... that's it?... Yep! That's it! That's all there is to it. Just make the platform and turn it into a <b>func_plat</b>. Measure the <b>distance</b> between the <b>start</b> and <b>end</b> position of the <b>top</b> of your platform and transfer that value straight to the <b>height</b> key pair and you're all set. It makes no difference what size or shape the brushes of your platform are or whether they overlap or not when using this method. The only restriction is that the plat has to be drawn in the raised position as always.<br><br>
	
	<center><img src="/content/quake2/entity/images/func_plat2.gif"><br>
	
	Second method of evaluating platform travel</center><br><br><p><hr color=black noshade width=75%><p>So in conclusion, both methods work fine. Choosing which one to use at this point depends mainly on design particulars and personal taste.<br><br>
	
	You can also specify the speed, acceleration and deceleration of the platform. <b>Speed</b>, <b>acceleration</b> and <b>decelaration</b> are self explanatory.  If you want to have the platform triggered then just give it a targetname and target it with a trigger.<br><br>

	<p>Rotating brushes were first showcased in hipnotic's quake mission pack and they were <b>extremely</b> difficult to get to work. They required a ton of work to get them to turn out right. Well quake2 fixed all this. Rotating brushes are very easy to use now.<br><br>
	
	The first step in making your rotating brush is to make the actually brushes that will be rotating. There are basically 2 parts to a rotating brush. First part is the object that will <b>rotate</b> and the second is the object that part 1 will <b>rotate</b> around. We are going to call this the <b>origin brush</b>. Think of it as the part that won't be moving. For example...picture a fan with 2 blades that are spinning around. The middle part that the blades are connected to would be the origin brush.<br><br><center><img src="/content/quake2/entity/images/func_rotating.jpg"><br>rotation explanation</center><br><br>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%><p>After creating the brushes that will make up your <b>func_rotating</b> then select all the parts of the object and turn it into a <b>func_rotating</b>. Now <b>select</b> the part of the object that will be the non moving center(<b>origin</b>) of the object and change the surface property of it to an origin brush.<br><br>
	
	By default the object will rotate on the z axis. To change this just set the spawnflag to either <b>x_axis</b> or <b>y_axis</b>. <b>Z axis</b> rotation is parallel to the floor. <b>X axis</b> rotation will be parallel to the wall at 90 or 273 degrees. <b>Y axis</b> rotation is parallel to the wall at 0 and 180 degrees.<br><br>
	
	There are a few more spawnflags that you can set for a <b>func_rotating</b>. They are <b>start_on</b>, <b>reverse</b>, <b>touch_pain</b>, and <b>stop</b>. <b>Start_on</b> will make the rotating object start rotating when the game begins. Reverse makes the brush rotate in the opposite direction. By default the rotating object will only cause you pain if you are stuck between the object and a wall or something. If <b>touch_pain</b> is turned on then it will cause damage to any entity it touches. <b>Stop</b> makes the rotating object stop completely when the an entity such as the player blocks its way. It will still take your health away though. By default a func_rotating will push you around with it. With stop set it will not push you just give damage.<br><br>
	
	You can also specify the <b>speed</b> of the object and <b>damage</b> it will give out. Just set the key value pairs speed and dmg to change these. So if you made a fan and you wanted it to kill the player very quickly when touched then you would set dmg to something like 200. dmg=100. Likewise with speed.<br><br>

<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%><p>A func_train is moving object that travels along a specified path. For those of you familiar with quake1 editing then your probably familiar with func_trains. They are not the easiest entity to use but they are not extremely difficult.<br><br>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>
	
	<p><b>How do I get the dang thing to work?!</b><br>
	
	It takes at least 2 entities to get a func_train in working order. The actual func_train and more then 1 path_corner. The <b>path_corners</b> specify the actual path that the func_train will follow. We will get to that in a little later though.<br><br>
	
	<b>First</b> thing you need to do is to build the actual object that will be the func_train. This can be one single brush or multiple brushes, it all depends on what you want the train to be. After you have build the object then you will need to turn the object into a func_train entity. It does not matter where you place the func_train because it will automatically spawn at the first path_corner.<br><br>
	
	The <b>second</b> thing that you need to do is to make all your <b>path_corners</b>. These will be the actual path that the func_train will follow as mentioned above. Each path_corner will link to the next. So if I made a lift that would travel around the corners of a square room then I would have 4 path_corners. The first one would have a <b>targetname p1</b>, and a <b>target p2</b>. The second one would have a <b>targetname p2</b> and a <b>target p3</b>. Third one would have a targetname p3 and a target p4. The fourth one would have a targetname p4 and if you wanted the lift to continuously travel around the room then you would give it a <b>target p1</b>, which is the targetname of the first <b>path_corner</b>. Now I am going to go into more detail on all the different key value pairs and spawnflags.<br><br>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%><p><b>Key Value Pairs of the func_train</b><br><b>speed</b> - speed is simply the speed that the func_train will travel from path_corner to path_corner.<br><br>
	
	<b>dmg</b> - dmg is the amount of damage the train will inflict when it crushes you up agaist a object. What I mean is it won't take off damage by just touching you...only when you are like...trapped up against a wall and the func_train.<br><br><b>noise</b> - noise is the sound that will be played when the func_train is moving. Here is a list(<b>please link to list</b>) of sounds that you can use. Don't forget to include the directory along with the sound name. Example: <b>noise</b> world/pump1.wav.<br><br>
	
	<b>target</b> - target will be set to the first path_corner. A func_train MUST have a target key and it MUST be a path_corner.<br><br>
	
	<b>targetname</b> - If a func_train has a targetname then it will have to be triggered before it will be become active.<br><br>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%><p><b>spawnflags</b><br>
	
	<b>start_on</b> - By default a train will only start moving when triggered by another entity. If you set the start_on spawnflag then the func_train will start moving when the level starts.<br><br>
	
	<b>toggle</b> - toggle will allow the func_train to be toggled on and off numerous times. It will only work when a func_train is triggered into action multiple times by another entity such as a func_button. This is useful in making moving elevator type platforms.<br><br>
	
	<b>block_stops</b> - When the spawnflag block_stops is set the func_train will stop completely when an entity like the player is blocking its way and it won't take any damage off. EVEN if the dmg key is set.<br><br>
	
	<b>Other misc. things you might like to know about the func_train and path_corners</b><br>
	
	func_trains are very useful entities and can be used for a variety of cool effects. To get some of these cool effects you need to be familiar with some of the spawnflags of a path_corner like, <b>teleport</b>, <b>pathtarget</b>, and <b>wait</b>.<br><br>
	
	<b>teleport</b> will actually teleport the func_train to the next path_corner that is targeted. This was used in the id levels to create the cool conveyor belts in some of the levels. It can also create the effect of moving crates. Just use one func_train that looks like a crate, target it to 2 path_corners, have teleport on for the second one.<br><br>
	
	<b>pathtarget</b> corresponds to a targetname of an entity that will be triggered when the func_train arrives at that path_corner. This can be used for a variety of cool effects. I remember seeing this in the id level where a machine is carrying a barrel from the ceiling and it smashing into the wall and blows a hole in it. This effect was created by placing a path_corner very close to a wall that is actually a func_explosive. Then the pathtarget of that path_corner is set to the targetname of the func_explosive. Pretty cool.<br><br>
	
	<b>wait</b> will make the func_train wait at that path_corner for the specified amount of time before preceding to the next path_corner.<br><br>

	<a name="func_wall"><h3>func_wall</h3></a>

<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>
	
	<p>A <b>func_wall</b> is a very strange entity. It's basically a wall that can be triggered into or out of existance. id used func_walls on a number of levels to make a wall <b>disappear</b> and let creatures out to surprise you. If you have played single player quake any then you know what I'm talking about. Well they are real easy to use. Func_walls that is.<br><br>
	
	First thing you do is make the wall. Then you turn it into a func_wall. Currently this wall will not show up in your level. It must be triggered to work. So give the func_wall a targetname and create some sort of trigger like a func_botton or whatever and set the target of the trigger to the func_wall. So lets say you give your func_wall a targetname of wall1. Then you make a trigger_once to trigger it open. You would give the trigger_one a target of wall1. Now whenever the player comes in contact with this trigger_once then the wall will suddenly blink into existance killing anything blocking it. Cool huh?<br><br>
	
	There are a few spawnflags that you can set that will change the actions of the wall. They are <b>trigger_spawn</b>, <b>toggle</b>, and <b>start_on</b>. <b>Trigger_spawn</b> must be set if you have triggered the func_wall. In all the possible uses that I can think of for the wall I can't think of one in which you wouldn't have trigger_spawn set. s<b>tart_on</b> makes the wall work in reverse. Instead of the wall blinking into existance it will blink out of existance. This is how id uses func_wall in a lot of their levels to let monsters out of a secret room to surprise the player. If <b>start_on</b> is set then toggle must be set also. I actually don't think it has to be set but if you don't set it then you will get a error message when entering your level. Probably a bug in the code but it doesn't hurt anything.<br><br>

	<p></a><b><a href="/content/quake2/entity/samples/func_water.zip">Download Sample Map</a></b><br><br>
	
	<a name="func_water"><h3>func_water</h3></a>

<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>

        <p><b>Func_water</b> is kinda an easy entity to use and its pretty damn cool. What it does is creates a water brush(lava, slime, etc) that can move. Like a pool of water slowly bobbing up and down. You can also use it to make some other cool effects like a trap that when triggered an area fills up with lava. IF you really want to get fancy you can make a func_water brush without a solid non-water brush to make some kick ass effects that i have included in the examples zip file at the bottom of the page.<br><br>
	
	First thing you need to do is create the brush you want to be the moving water and make it a <b>func_water</b> entity. One thing to remember is that the water must not be <b>translucent</b>. For some reason only non-translucent water will work with a func_water. A func_water entity must be triggered to work so therefore it must have a <b>targetname</b>. So lets give it a targetname of <b>water1</b>.<br><br>
	
	Next you need to specify the <b>angle</b> of the water movement. For most purposes you will only need the water to move up and down but if you can find a purpose to make the water move left or right then go for it. So lets set the angle of the movement to be down. angle=-2.<br><br>Now you need to set the <b>sound</b> of the water brush. You can either have 0)no sound, 1)water, 2)lava. lets make it have a water sound. sounds=1<br><br>
	
	You can also specify the <b>speed</b> of the movement, the wait before returning, and the lip remaining at end of the move.<br><br>
	
	Okay, the final thing to do to get your <b>func_water</b> to work is to make the <b>trigger</b> that will start the movement of the water. Any kind of trigger will work. If you want the water to bob up and down continuously you will need to use a <b>func_timer</b>. If you want to make a lava trap you will need to use a <b>trigger_once</b>, <b>trigger_multiple</b>, or a <b>func_button</b>.<br><br>
	
	so all that is left to do is choose what you are going to use the func_water for and pick the trigger entity that you wish to use and set the target of the trigger entity to the name of the func_water.target=water1<br><br>

They are a little hard to get used to, but after you know the basics, you should do fine.<br><br>
	
	There is only one key/value pair you need to know with the info_player_intermission, and that is <b>"angles"</b>. Most entities have an <b>"angle"</b> key, but in the case of the <b>info_player_intermission</b>, you need three (hence, the 's'.) Here's the breakdown:<br><br>Create an info_player_intermission where you want your intermission camera to be, and give it a key of "angles". Now, you want to put three numbers in as your value. Each one of these numbers is an angle. The first is the pitch, the second yaw, and the third roll. Chances are you won't be using the third number (roll) much, since it tilts you side to side, but hey, you can do what ever you want. Heres a little picture illustrating <b>pitch</b>, <b>yaw</b>, and <b>roll</b>:<br><br>
	
	<center><img src="/content/quake2/entity/images/info_player_intermission.gif"><br>xyz</center><br><br>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%><p>The <b>pitch</b> angle (first number of the three) controlls the up/down angle of the camera. Lets say you would like your camera to look down about 15 degrees. In this case, you would make the first number a 15.<br><br>The <b>yaw</b> angle (second number) controls how much the camera is turned from the zero angle (pointing east, on a top-down view of your map.) If you want the camera to look to the west (again, we're talking about a top-down view relative to the map in your editor, and not relative to the actual camera view,) you would give it an angle of 180. If you wanted it to look south, you would use 270.<br><br>The <b>roll</b> angle controls the side to side tilt of the camera. Chances are, you will want to leave this at zero, unless you're going for the "just got shot, laying on your side" look, in which case you could give it 90 or 270. If you want the "hanging by your feet" look, then 180.<br><br>So, an info_player_intermission that looks 30 degrees down, southwest, and standing on it's "feet" (or hanging by it's "hair", it's all relative) would have an "angles" key with a value of "30 225 0".<br><br>

	<p>You might be thinking thinking why the hell I did a tutorial over keys cause they are just items that you can place anywhere and they have no spawnflags or key value pairs to mess with. Well you are right. They are very simple to put in your level but getting some use out of them is a different story.<br><br>
	
	There are 9 different kinds of keys. They are <b>key_airstrike_target</b>, <b>key_blue_key</b>, <b>key_commander_head</b>, <b>key_data_cd</b>, <b>key_data_spinner</b>, <b>key_pass</b>, <b>key_power_cube</b>, <b>key_pyramid</b>, and <b>key_red_key</b>.<br><br>
	
	All of them act in exactly the same way, they just look different. What's cool about the keys is that they can be used to trigger anything you want them to, not just doors. You could have a key stop a turbine or make a computer explode. The possibilities are endless.<br><br>To get the keys to do these kind of things you must use a few different entities. For example:<br><br>
	
	Lets make it so that you have to use a <b>key_data_spinner</b> to turn off a big fan. <br><br>
	
	<ul><li>First we would make the fan of course and make it into a func_rotating and then make the computer that you will stick the key_data_spinner into that will turn off the fan. If you don't know how to do this then I suggest you check out my tutorial on the func_rotating entity. You also need to give the func_rotating a targetname. Lets give it a targetname of fan. targetname=fan.<li>The next thing we want to do is to place a trigger_key somewhere in the level and target it to the fan. target=fan. You should also give the trigger_key a targetname. Lets give it a targetname of key. targetname key<li>Next we need to specify what item will be needed to trigger the func_rotating and turn it off. You do this by setting the key value pair item to the name of the key. So in this example we would set item=key_data_spinner on the trigger_key entity.<li>There is one more thing to do and that is there must be a trigger where you want the key to be used that will trigger the trigger_key entity. So we would go to the area we made where the key_data_spinner will need to be placed and put a trigger_multiple right in front of the area. The closer and smaller the better. Then target the trigger_key with the trigger_multiple. In this example we would set target=key for the trigger_multiple.</ul><br><br>
	
	<center><img src="/content/quake2/entity/images/key.gif"></center><br><br>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>
	
	<p>Hope this clears everything up for ya. Now this is just one little example. There are unlimited uses for these keys. Instead of turning off a fan the key to make some computers explode. One of the more noticable uses of the keys that is in the id maps was the airstrike, which is just the key_airstrike_target and a trigger_key that triggers the misc_viper_bomb to fly by and a big explosion. I will definitly explain this in a future tutorial.<br><br>

	<p><a name="light"></a><b><a href="/content/quake2/entity/samples/light.zip">Download Sample Map</a></b><h3>light</h3>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>
	
	<p>Ask any level designer what the most time consuming part of level design is, and they will most likely answer: lighting. The fact is, lighting isn't that difficult in implementation, but rather in choices of lighting, and the amount of options available. We'll try to break down the choices here.<br><br>
	
	Lights, since they are just point entities with working defaults, are among the easiest entities to add, but the actual method varies from editor to editor, so check the docs for yours.<br><br>
	
	Now, on to the good stuff. Here are the flags and fields, and their uses:<br><br>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>
	
	<p><b>LIGHT</b><br>
	
	This is the brightness of the light. Default is 300. The fall-off distance of the light is proportional (the brighter the light, the further it shines.)<br><br>
	
	In order to change the light value, simply add a key of "<b>light</b>" with the desired keyvalue.<br><br>One thing worthy of mention. Light entities differ from lit surfaces, in that the amount of light that a surface emits is dependent on the size of the face, whereas two light entities with the same "<b>light</b>" keyvalue will always emit the same amount of light, regardless of color. (which is why software Q2 always looks so bright)<br><br>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>
	
	<p><b>_COLOR</b><br>
	
	(Note, a value prefixed with an underscore means that the key will be ignored if the default is not applicable. This is why "color" works here as well. It's good practice to always include the underscore, even if it works without it.)<br><br>
	
	This is the color that the light entity will emit. The actual color is determined by a set of three numbers between 0 and 1, representing red, green, and blue, respectively. The _color values are proportional, meaning that a value of "<b>0.1 0.1 0.1</b>" would give you exactly the same thing as "<b>1 1 1</b>", and "<b>0.5 1 1</b>" would give you the same as "<b>0.25 0.5 0.5</b>"<br><br>
	
	<b>Example</b><br
	
	>"_color" "0 0 1" would emit blue light in gl<br>"_color" "1 1 1" would emit white light in gl<br>"_color" "0.5 0.5 0.5" would emit white in gl<br>"color" "1 0 0" would emit red light in gl, but kick out a "color is not a field" warning in software. (moral: use the underscore)<br><br>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%><p><b>STYLE</b><br>
	
	The style key determines whether or not the light will be a dynamic light, and if so what pattern it will follow. The default is 0 (static).<br><br>Here are the values, and their patterns. 'a' represents total darkness, and 'z' represents double brightness. 'm' is normal brightness (nabbed from the gamex86 source):<br><br>
	
	<ul><li>FLICKER (first variety): "mmnmmommommnonmmonqnmmo"<li>SLOW STRONG PULSE: "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba"<li>CANDLE (first variety): "mmmmmaaaaammmmmaaaaaabcdefgabcdefg" <li>FAST STROBE: "mamamamamama" <li>GENTLE PULSE 1: "jklmnopqrstuvwxyzyxwvutsrqponmlkj" <li>FLICKER (second variety): "nmonqnmomnmomomno" <li>CANDLE (second variety): "mmmaaaabcdefgmmmmaaaammmaamm" <li>CANDLE (third variety): "mmmaaammmaaammmabcdefaaaammmmabcdefmmmaaaa" <li>SLOW STROBE (fourth variety): "aaaaaaaazzzzzzzz"<li>FLUORESCENT FLICKER: "mmamammmmammamamaaamammma" <li>SLOW PULSE NOT FADE TO BLACK: "abcdefghijklmnopqrrqponmlkjihgfedcba" </ul><p><br><br>
	
	12-31 open for modification<br><br>
	
	32-62 reserved by QRAD3 for switchable light styles, and 63 is reserved for testing<br><br>
	
	In order to make a dynamic light, simply add a key of "style" and the appropriate value. (ex: "style" "5" will make a pulsing light.)<br><br>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%><p><b>TARGET/INFO_NULL/SPOTLIGHTS</b><br
	
	>A light entity can only target one thing: an info_null. What happens when you target an info_null? a spot light happens. (woo) Personally, I dig spotlights, and use them a lot. Here's how you do it.<br><br>
	
	Create a light. Give it a "target" key, and a keyvalue (we'll use "spot1".) <b>Create an info_null at the place at which you want the spotlight to point</b>. Give the info_null a "targetname" key, and keyvalue (again, "spot1".)<br><br>
	
	Now, what if you want a wider spotlight? Well, that's why we have...<br><br>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>
	
	<p><b>_CONE</b><br>
	
	The default _cone value is 10. The higher the value, the wider the spot. To use it, add the "<b>cone</b>" key, and the desired value to the light entity.<br><br>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>
	
	<p><b>Switchable lights</b><br>
	
	Let's say we wan't a light to be turned on or off by some other event (be it a button, trigger, etc..) What we need to do in this case, is to set up the triggering event (in this case, a <b>func_button</b>) and give it a "<b>target</b>" (we'll use "<b>lt1</b>".) Now, we need to create a light, and give it a "<b>targetname</b>" of "<b>lt1</b>". We now have a light that turns off when we hit the button. If you would like the light to turn on when you hit the button, set the <b>start_off</b> spawnflag for the light.<br><br>
	
	<p><a name="light_mine1"></a><h3>light_mine1</h3>
	
	<p><a name="light_mine2"></a><h3>light_mine2</h3>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>
	
	<p>The light mines are simply predefined lights that are the lights that were used on the mine levels in quake2. They act like normal lights they just have a predefined shape. Here are pics of them.<br><br>
	
	<center><img src="/content/quake2/entity/images/light_mine1.jpg"><br>light_mine1<br><br><img src="/content/quake2/entity/images/light_mine2.jpg"><br>
	
	light_mine2</center><br><br>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%>
	
	<p>NOTE: If you want to rotate a light_mine (1 or 2) you have to give it an "angle" key. <br><br>
	
	<p><hr color=black noshade width=75%><p>
	
	<b>_minlight</b><br>
	
	_minlight is a very strange key value pair that can be used with certain entities like func_door, func_button, func_rotating, etc, etc. Basically any visual entity except the item entities. What it does is makes the object glow. Lets say you have a very dark room and there is a button the player has to press but it is so dark that the player is not going to be able to find it. Well, this is where _minlight can come in very handy. Select the func_button entity and give it a key value pair of _minlight and a value of 1. This will make the func_button glow a faint white so it will be more visible. <br><br>
	
	The glow from _minlight does not make the surronding area any brighter, just the object that has the _minlight value. <br><br>
	
	The values for _minlight should be between 0 and 2. I have not noticed any difference with exteremly high values. 2 seems to be the max.<br>

	<p><a name="#misc_bigviper"><b>misc_bigviper</b></a> - The misc_bigviper is the ship model that you can see in the quake2 intro that can be placed in a level but acts very differently then the other ship entities. It does absolutly nothing at all!<br><br>
	
	<p><a name="#misc_blackhole"><b>misc_blackhole</b></a> - There are no flags or options for misc_blackhole. It just spins. The only thing worthy of mention is the fact that, while the entity in your editor is about the size of a light, the in-game misc_blackhole is very, very big. Allow at least 256 units in all directions.<br><br>
	
	<p><a name="#misc_deadsoldier"><b>misc_deadsoldier</b></a> - Not much to say about these. Pretty self explanatory. There are six varieties, determined by spawnflags: <b>on_back</b>, <b>on_stomach</b>, <b>back_decap</b>, <b>fetal_pos</b>, <b>sit_decap</b>, and <b>impaled</b>. Obviously, only one flag can be set for each <b>misc_deadsoldier</b> (a guy would have to be pretty badly worked over to be on his back and his stomach at the same time.) Insert one in your map, and voila! Instant dead guy! Two things worth of mention, however: 1) <b>misc_deadsoldier</b> entities will not drop to the floor, so if you don't want them to float, align them on the floor. 2)a <b>misc_deadsoldier</b> with the <b>impaled</b> flag just won't look right unless he's suspended or impaled somehow. (in water, on a hook, etc).<br><br>

	<ol><li>Make sure that your editor is zoomed in pretty close with a grid or maybe 8 or so.  This way you can be sure that you line everything up right.<li>Place the <b>misc_eastertank</b> along the floor.<li>Put the <b>misc_easterchick</b> so that it's bottom side is aligned with the bottom side of the <b>misc_eastertank</b>.<li>Now put the misc_easterchick2 in the same place as the misc_easterchick.

	<p><a name="#misc_insane"><b>misc_insane</b></a> - The <b>misc_insane</b> are the marines you see wandering around in the game. They're extremely easy to use. They act a bit like monsters, in that if they don't have a specific path, they will follow you around.<br><br>
	
	There are a few spawnflags and keys for misc_insane:<br><br>
	
	<b>ambush</b>: A misc_insane with this flag set will not react to you until it has a direct line of sight, or until you do damage to it. Then it will follow you around. If the misc_insane is set to follow a path, it will only react when shot.<br><br>
	
	<p><a name="#misc_satellite_dish"><b>misc_satellite_dish</b></a> - The <b>misc_sattelite_dish</b> can be either placed in a map on its own, in which case it will just sit there and look...well...like a sattelite dish; or it can be triggered by another event, such as a func_button. If the dish is triggered, it will tilt up, and then rotate to the left. One thing to keep in mind when setting up the triggering event, though: When the dish is triggered, it moves smoothly, but if it is triggered again, it jerks back to it's starting position, with no animation frames. So, it's best to either use a trigger_once, or a button with a "<b>wait</b>" value of "<b>-1</b>" (never return.)<br><br>
	
	<p><a name="#misc_strogg_ship"><b>misc_strogg_ship</b></a> - see misc_viper
	
	<p><a name="#misc_teleporter"><b>misc_teleporter</b></a> - The <b>misc_teleporter</b> and <b>misc_teleporter_dest</b> are 2 extremely simple entities that must be used together to create the teleporters that you see in the id maps when playing deathmatch. They can be used in single player but I don't seem to remember id using them any time in the game. Getting a teleporter to work is very simple, much easier then in quake1.<br><br>
	
	First thing you must do is decide where you want the teleporter of course and then place the misc_teleporter entity. Then you must place the misc_teleporter_dest where you want to be teleported. Then <b>give the misc_teleporter_dest a targetname and target it with the misc_teleporter</b>. It's that simple. For example, lets give the misc_teleporter_dest a <b>targetname</b> of t1. Then we would give the misc_teleporter a target of t1. Thats it.<br><br>
	
	In quake2 you cannot change the look of the teleporters or the size. They are solid entities that have their own models.<br><br>
	
	<p><a name="#misc_teleporter_dest"><b>misc_teleporter_dest</b></a> - see misc_teleporter above
	
	<p><a name="#misc_viper"><b>misc_viper</b></a> - The <b>misc_viper</b>, and <b>misc_strogg_ship</b> are those space ships that you see in some of the id levels that fly through the sky every once in awhile. There are a few of them that you can see on the very first level. They are very simple to use in a level and look real cool.<br><br>
	
	<u>How do I make the damn things?</u><br>There is minimum of 4 entities that must be used to get these ships flying. They are some sort of <b>trigger</b> to start the ships movement, the <b>ship</b>, the <b>starting path_corner</b>, and the <b>ending path_corner</b>. There can be more path_corners in between the first and the last one for a more detailed flying path but only 2 are required.<br><br>
	
	The <b>misc_viper</b> and <b>misc_strogg_ship</b> are used in a very similar way to a func_train. <br><br>
	
	The first thing you must do is pick the ship you wish to use. You can place the ship entity anywhere in the level because it will automatically appear at the first path_corner.<br><br>
	
	The second thing you need to do is to make the beginning and ending path_corners and any number of ones in between. This will be the actual path the ships will follow when triggered. Each path_corner must target the next. You should also give the ship a target to the first path_corner. So if the first path_corner has a targetname of p1 then the ship entity will have a target of p1. If you want the ship to keep going forever then you will need to set the <b>teleport spawnflag</b> for the <b>last path_corner</b> and set the target of the last path_corner back to the first path_corner. This will actually teleport the ship back to the area of the first path_corner and create the appearance of multiple ships. Pretty cool.<br><br>
	
	The last thing you need to do to get the ship to actually work is to <b>create a trigger</b> of some sort to turn the ship on. If you want it to start when the level starts then you should use a <b>trigger_always</b>. So what this means you have to give the ship a targetname then give the trigger that will be used to turn the ship on a target key value pair equal to the targetname of the ship.<br><br><u>Key Value Pairs</u><br><b>speed</b><br>Speed is the speed that the ship will travel.<br><br>
	
	<b>angle</b><br>
	
	angle determines the direction the ship will face. This should be set to the direction the ship will travel or it will look strange.<br><br>
	
	<p><a name="#misc_viper_bomb"><b>misc_viper_bomb</b></a> - At first I had the misc_viper_bomb in another tutorial with the ship entities because I thought it was one of the ships like the viper but I was wrong. It is actually a bomb that one of the ships can drop. It was used during the game with the airstriker marker. It's a pretty complicated entity to figure out but I will show you how its done. Also thought I should mention that this tutorial is here because of EutecTic. This guy knows everything! He even made the awesome example map.<br><br>
	
	First thing you need to do is place the actual ship entity that will drop the bomb. You will have to use the <b>misc_viper</b>. You will also need to know how to get it to work, which I explained in a past tutorial you can check out here.<br><br>
	
	So now you should have the ship linked to some <b>path_corners</b>. Now create the misc_viper_bomb and place it at the path_corner where you want the ship to drop the bomb. Not on the ground but up in the air right on the path_corner. Since the bomb falls in an arc trajectory, it has to be released ahead of it's target just like the real thing. It's forward speed is about half of it's falling speed so if you place the bomb at one half the forward distance of its release height, it should fall right where you want it to.<br><br>
	
	Now you need to specify the damage that you want the bomb to take off. If you want it to kill everyone in site then set <b>dmg</b> to 10000. <b>You also need to give the misc_viper_bomb a targetname and a pathtarget</b>. These should be the same name. So lets set the targetname to boom and the pathtarget to boom.<br><br>
	
	Now select the path_corner where the bomb will be dropped at and give it the key value pair <b>pathtarget</b> and set it to the bomb. pathtarget=boom.<br><br>
	
	Things to remember.....The misc_viper <b>must</b> be triggered! If you don't understand how to get the misc_viper working then read the tutorial.<br><br>

			<b>monster_berserk</b> - <b>Berserker</b><br><br> Health: Low <br><br> 

Knives.  Hammers.  This is the Strogg equivalent of the handy-man! Useless at a distance, unless you want the player to be distracted, he's better to come from behind, the side, or suddenly in the player's face, forcing them to react!  Good for use on cat-walks, since he can fling you off, to a bloody death, or a sizzle in the lava, or a swim back to the nearest ladder/elevator.  The Berserker is a bit of a dolt tho, and doesn't realize to stop swinging if you've backed off, so you might want to put one in an enclosed room, so the player has little room to dodge around.  This however defeats the purpose of his hyper-fast legs!  So use him is both situations.  The second being in a large room, so he has room to gain on you, but keep the player's arsenal to a low, other-wise, he's not good for much except a place to put all that lead the player carries around in.<BR><BR>

This bastard is lethal and good at a distance. His rockets are fairly easy to dodge, but can KILL the player if he hits... In theory you could use two, but it could be considered unfair, or an overkill. But these guys work as a team, honestly 4 chainguns, 8 rockets, the player'll never know what hit 'em!<BR><BR>

			<b>monster_brain</b> - <b>Brain</b><br><br> Health: High + Power Screen <br><br>

Probably the stupidest, yet coolest enemy in Quake II.  The brain is slow as hell, has a stupid method of attack, but if used correctly can be a rather effective enemy.  First, try not to think of the Brain as an attacker, he works better as a computer technician or scientist trying to get you out of his lab, or distract you from the other Strogg soldiers sneaking up on you.  They have a Power-Screen to keep them alive. Brains have a lot of life, and take a pounding, so in swarms they can produce some very gratifying situations, in one map I was stuck on a  table, surrounded by 4 or 5 Brains, very creepy, because they just slowly edge towards you, snapping out the tentacles when they get close enough. Brains are useful in the dark, since their attack has a decent range.<BR><BR>

Sugar and spice, and everything not nice.  This is one bad girl, but you probably don't wanna be spanking her titanium ass!  She's a little dull at a distance, since she hasn't quite figured out what the rockets in her launcher are for...<br><br> So use her with a distraction, so she can launch a few of those bad boys up the player's ass, where they belong.  After all, isn't it about killing him/her?<br><br> Her claws are razor sharp, but again, she prefers to slap you with them if you get close enough for a kiss, so keep her above you to have some nice rocket bombardment.  For inexperianced players, her voice can be misleading, so hide her well, and spring her when they least expect her... hehehe...<BR><BR>

Ever see the movie Jaws?  No relation here!  These sardines don't pose TOO much threat, unless in huge swarms.  Their best attribute is their speed and the fact that they are hard to hit.  Best used to suprise a player, unleash them behind him, and watch the water fill with blood!<BR><BR>

These are probably THE most annoying enemy in Quake 2!  They take forever to kill, they fly, their weapons are devastating, and they're rather stealthly. So let's have some fun with them!  Like the Brains, Technicians are NOT soldiers!  They belong in computer places, pipes or just about anywhere that maintenence might be required.  They attack best when from above, in front of the player makes them an easier target, but at the end of a hall can be quite deadly, as their hyper-blaster stings like hell!  The Technicians have a snapping claw, not very useful.  A tazer, not quite as useless, and then they have their blaster.  Technicians are good for dropping items such as key-cards and CD's.... But it's best that they simply hover around and make like they're repairing stuff.<BR><BR>

This is the ugly one.  With a face not even a mother could love, and a pair of legs which make him look like a certain hooved menace with a rocket launcher we all loved to hate, the Gladiator is one of the nasty ones.  Usually I play the game thru, and only death, or a rail-shot to the head can make me quick-load.  He's a little slow, but fast enough to scare you.  Keep him at a distance, so he makes good use of his shoulder mounted railgun.  Up close his melee attack does the most damage, save for the Berserker, but his railgun does far more.  Good for guarding keys, and exits, also useful when below you, or above, and picks you off as you ride the elevator.  On the other end of a bridge is a nice touch since he's not gonna be asking three questions before he launches the player's sorry ass off the bridge.<BR><BR>

This is the ultimate Strogg.  He has a gun that takes a while to open a rapid-fire grenade launcher, and an attitude!  If other enemies get in his path of destruction he is indifferent to it, and will keep firing until either you or him is dead.  When placed above the player on cat-walks he is effective at causing a rain of grenades, when in a room full of explosive crates, explosive barrels, or just little room to move, this is probably his most lethal use.  His gun is a little slow, but if put out of sight, not totally, just until the player looks around a bit, he can be rather devastating without the use of armor.<BR><BR>

His ass must get hot from those two jets mounted on his shoulders.... The Icarus is a rather distinctive enemy, useful for patrol of areas with high ceilings, or the outdoors areas.  The Icarus is a type of enemy that can perch, since he seems to have a standing motion, how to get it used, I have NO idea, but it's there.... maybe the guy's just confused.

Bald head, beady eyes, a chaingun that's gotta be cocked before firing.  This guy is even trained in martial arts!  What more could you ask for in an enemy?  These guys are my personal favorite enemy; they go down from one double-barreled shotgun blast, at close range of course, and have several deaths, the flip being the most exciting! These boys are useful in waves, and effective as prison guards, they have about the I.Q. of the gun they are carrying, and know how to duck rockets at a distance.  A final note is that up close they always use they karate chop, so keep them at a distance, and let the berserkers do the chopping and mangling!<BR><BR>

This is THE BIG BOSS.  He sports 2 ASS-KICKING CHAIN-CANNONS and a FREAKING BFG 10K!!! Yipes!  The Jorg makes a lot of noise when moving about, and I'm pretty sure he makes this creepy laugh as he goes about his business of mopping the floor with you!  If the player has a Quad or Invulnerability or BOTH then the Jorg is screwed.  Also it's passenger is pretty much eff'd. So try to deny the player these things.  When the Jorg is killed the Makron leaps from it's body and proceeds to kick yer ass with a Railgun, a HYPER-BLASTER and another freaking BFG10K!!  Actually, it's the same one as the Jorg had, since the Jorg would raise its torso and let's the Makron fire it.  When knocked down Makron says stuff like "Not Good Enough!" or "Weakling!" Needless to say, he's a pretty creepy character.  I don't recommend using this thing UNLESS it is a Return of the Makron MOD!  Makron got killed at the end of the game, so try and keep faithful to that.<BR><BR>

These bastards are EVIL!  They move faster, and farther than the Demon in Quake 1, and have this eerie sound they make when they stalk around!  Great for hiding behind walls and such, or in hidden cages, to be released when the player gets to a certain area.  The Mutants have plenty of life, but a hyper-blaster or chaingun will take them out fairly efficiently.

			<b>monster_parasite</b> - <b>Parasite</b><br><br> Health: Medium <br><br>

Here poochy-poochy-poochy!  PLAY DEAD!  This is probably the most foul enemy in the game, he literally sucks the life out of you, and he sniffs other Strogg's butts!  (j/k)  But seriously, with the personality of a dog, what could you expect, he's even got fleas. Useful around corners, such as crates, or pipes.  He works well from the hidden cubby-hole in the wall to your left/right.  Takes a bit of a pounding, and moves pretty fast.  His clicking sounds can be mistaken for mechanical ambience.  Again, useless at a distance, works well in narrow halls, with little room to dodge, but gives the player a straight line-of-sight.  Works well with the distraction technique, but gives his presence away with that un-Godly bark.<BR><BR>

			<b>monster_soldier</b> - <b>Shotgun Guard</b><br><br> Health: Very Low <br><br>

Bigger gun, bigger life, same size brain.  Having the same smarts as the light guard the shotgun guard can be applied in the same manner as his weaker cousin.  However, his weapon is twice as big as he is, so he can tear you up!  Without the protection of armor shotgun guards will kill you in a matter of moments, if they are given the advantage of height, or cover, or simply in large numbers. As stated, he's not to bright, so give him room to maneuver, and a friend or two.<BR><BR>

This bad-boy just ain't so bad, he's got a puny laser, and not a lot of life.  He's noisy, and not too bright. But oh, the possibilities!<br><br>If you place light guards above the player, in packs, they can amount to something, at first the player might shrug it off as tho it were just a mosquito bite, but as each blaster bolt fries his skin, it starts to wear on him.  This can also be used to distract him from hidden or approaching enemies, that are elsewhere.  <br><br>Add a barrel, or explosive crate near the light guards for an easy, and dazzling kill, or to save playing time.  Or you could just leave them there, for the player to have to pick off.<BR><BR>

The BIG mother, this guy is huge, taller than the Gunners, and twice as lethal.  The tank utilizes 3 weapons, a hyper-blaster, a chaingun and a rocket launcher.  The Tank is slow as hell, so be careful where you place him.  In confined areas he is useful, but only if the player has no room to maneuver.  At a distance is good, but again, makes him an easy target.  The Tank is a hard enemy to get good placement with.  His menacing walk is enough to strike fear into a poorly armed player, so keep them on their toes by throwing one of these bastards near the beginning, and there's no way around except to find a bigger gun.<BR><BR>

	<p><a name="#point_combat"><b>point_combat</b></a> - One thing that I mentioned earlier but I would like to go over again is the <B>point_combat</B> entity. Point_combats are used just like path_corners. They are not drawn in the map. Point_combat entites are simply points that the monster will walk to before attacking the player. You can have more then one linked.  Just give each point_combat a target to the next. Remember though that the monster will not attack until it is finished walking it's point_combats. In the <A HREF="rust21.zip">example</A> map I made 2 monster_chicks that when they see the player they take cover behind 2 low lying walls. This effect was achieved using point_combats. By default once the monster reaches the last point_combat it will go after the player like a normal monster. If you set the spawnflag <B>hold</B> on the point_combats then the creatures will hold their position once they reach the last point_combat and attack you from there. One thing I did notice though is if you shoot the monster and hurt it then it will quit following its point_combat and just attack the player.<br><br>
	
	There are a couple monster entities that don't act like the others. They are <B>monster_makron</B> and <B>monster_commander_body</B>. monster_makron is a broken entity and shouldn't be used and monster_commander_body is just the dead body of a monster_tank_commander that is just used for decoration.<br><br>
	
	I hope that this tutorial opened your eyes to many possibilities you can use the monster_ entities for. I thought that writing this tutorial was the one that I learned the most from out of all of the tutorials and I hope that it helped you as much as it helped me. If you find any errors or something new then please email <i>(note: author doesn't exist anymore)</i> me and let me know.<br><br>

- The <b>target_blaster</b> entity is simply blaster fire that can be triggered. What I mean by blaster fire is like when you shoot the your blaster(1st weapon) or your hyperblaster. I didn't really notice many times in the id levels where these were used. The only level I remember seeing this entity is the first secret level. Anyhow, it's very simple and there are numerous uses for it.<br><br>The <b>first</b> thing you need to do is create the gun or whatever that is going to shoot the blaster fire. You don't really need to make it if you don't want to if though.<br><br>Next thing you do is place the <b>target_blaster</b> entity where you want the blaster fire to originate from.<br><br> There are a few key value pairs and spawnflags that you can set to make the <b>target_blaster</b> act in different ways. The  key value pairs are <b>angle</b>, <b>damage</b>, and <b>speed</b>. <b>angle</b> determines the direction the target_blaster will fire. <b>damage</b> is of course the amount of damage the blast will take off when it hits another entity. <b>speed</b> is how fast the blaster fire will travel.<br><br>
</P>

<a name="target_changelevel"><b>target_changelevel</b></a>
<BR><BR>
 - The <b>target_crosslevel_*</b> entities are used to trigger unit-wide events. Press a button (or series of buttons) in one level of a unit, and a door opens in another. They aren't all that hard to use, if you're comfortable with triggers and targets, but before we get started, there are a few things you should know about the <strong>target_crosslevel_trigger</strong>, and <strong>target_crosslevel_target</strong> entities: <br><br>1.) The <strong>target_crosslevel_</strong> entities work by setting one or more of eight spawnflags, which are retained throughout a unit, which simply means <strong>you only get eight cross-level events per unit</strong>.   <br><br>2.) <strong>Make sure you have a unit exit at the end of the last level of the unit</strong>, as not resetting the spawnflags results in fewer available spawnflags for the next unit. A unit exit is just a target_changelevel with an asterisk (*) in front of the actual map$startpoint keyvalue. 
<BR><BR>
Here are a few examples: 
<ul><br><br>To go to e1u2 of the id levels (skipping the cinematic,) you would have a target_changelevel with the key 'map', which would have the keyvalue '*bunk1$start' <br><br>To go to e1u2 (including the cinematic,) you would have a target_changelevel with the key 'map', which would have the keyvalue 'eou1_.cin+*bunk1$start'  <br><br>To go to e1u1 you would have 'map'='*base1' (because the start for base1 doesn't have a targetname)</ul>
<br><br>3.) The crosslevel spawnflags are read when Q2 initializes the map, which means <strong>any crosslevel triggers will not have any effect until a level change. </strong> <br><br>With all of that in mind, let's start.  <br><br>First off, let's create a room with an <strong>info_player_start</strong>. Decide where you want your exit to be. Make a brush with the 'trig' texture at the area you've chosen as the exit, and make it into a trigger. It doesn't matter if it's multiple or once, because we'll be using it to exit anyway. Make a <strong>target_changelevel</strong>, and give it a key of '<strong>map</strong>' with a keyvalue of '<strong>tcex2$from1</strong>'. In this case, the '<strong>tcex2</strong>' is the next example map we'll be making; '<strong>$</strong>' means we'll be going to a specific <strong>info_player_start</strong> in tcex2; and '<strong>from1</strong>' will be the targetname of that <strong>info_player_start</strong>. <br><br>Now create another <strong>info_player_start</strong>, and put it near, <strong>but not touching</strong>, the exit (preferably facing away from it, but that's up to you.) Give it a targetname of '<strong>from2</strong>'. This is where you'll spawn if you come back to this map. <br><br>The next thing you need to do is set something up to trigger your <strong>target_crosslevel_trigger</strong>. This can be a button, item pickup, or anything that can trigger another event. Give it a target (we'll use <strong>tc1</strong> for this example.) Now, create your <strong>target_crosslevel_trigger</strong>, and give it a matching targetname (again, <strong>tc1</strong>.) Set the flag for <strong>trigger1</strong> in the entity window for your editor. Now, when you trigger it, the <strong>trigger1</strong> spawnflag will be set for the next map. <br><br>Save the map as '<strong>tcex1.map</strong>' <br><br>Now we need another level to go to. Create a room similar to the last, but with two exits this time. Set the keys for one <strong>target_changelevel</strong> to '<strong>map</strong>'='<strong>tcex1$from2</strong>' and the other to '<strong>map</strong>'='*<strong>base1</strong>'. Place an <strong>info_player_start</strong> near the exit that goes back to <strong>tcex1</strong>, and give it a targetname of '<strong>from1</strong>'. <br><br>Now, create a <strong>target_crosslevel_target</strong> and set the <strong>trigger1</strong> flag. Give it a '<strong>target</strong>' of '<strong>boom</strong>', and a '<strong>delay</strong>' of '<strong>2</strong>'. Make a <B>func_explosive</B>, and give it a '<strong>targetname</strong> 'of '<strong>boom</strong>'. <br><br>Compile and run the map. If everything worked properly (cross your fingers, it helps) then you should be able to trigger in the first level, and then go into the second level, wait a second, and *<strong>boom</strong>*. Just to make sure, try not to trigger the <strong>target_crosslevel_trigger</strong> before you go into the second map. <br><br>For further experimentation, you can set up more than one <strong>target_crosslevel_trigger</strong>, each with a different trigger flag checked (1, 2, 3...), and then set up one target_crosslevel_target with those flags checked. <strong>Only after you've triggered all events</strong> will the target be fired.<br><br>In the example maps, the first <strong>target_changelevel_trigger</strong> is a button, and the second, Carmack's head (I just <i>had</i> to throw it in.) When you come to the third level, a wall explodes, and you exit to the intro cinematic, followed by base1. I hope you find this helpful, as it helped me to make it. <br><br>

What this does is......create an earthquake!! Pretty difficult huh? There are a few options and other rules that you should know about though

The target_earthquake does NOT start on and must be triggered into working. There are 2 key value pairs that you can set. They are speed and count. Speed is the magnitude of the quake. Count is the length of time the quake will last. Some other things to know is that the earthquake does not give off damage and it is not viewed in the level so size of the entity does not matter.

What a target_explosion does is when triggered creates a visual explosion that can be set to do any amount of damage. There are 2 key value pairs that you can set. Dmg and delay. Dmg is the amount of damage the explosion will cause and delay is the amount of time after triggered that the explosion will take place.

The <strong>target_goal</strong> is used in exactly the same way as the target secret. However, since you will most likely have set up a <a href="http://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.gamedesign.net/node/32#target_help">target_help</a> to tell the player just what the goal is, you will most likely want to set up a new one at or near the <strong>target_goal</strong>.

<p><a name="target_help"><b>target_help</b></a>
<BR><BR>
 - <b>target_help</b></font> is the entity that makes those messages appear on your computer. It also makes the computer blink. They used it in quake2 to tell you about your primary and secondary missions on each level. 
<BR><BR>This entity must be triggered so therefore it <b>must have a targetname.</b> Set the key value pair <b>message</b> to whatever you want it to print. If you want it to come on right when the level is started then use a trigger_always. To specify primary or secondary objectives just set the spawnflag help1 and the message will appear in the primary objective space otherwise it will appear in the secondary. If you are having problems with the message being too long for the space provided on the computer then simple put a <b>\n</b> where you want the line to end.

 - This is another somewhat easy entity to use. i'm sure if you've played through quake2 then you've seen many examples of lasers and the cool effects that id used with the lasers. The cool effects like the moving spiraling lasers are a bit more difficult to implement but i'll try to show you how.<br><br> <br><br><center><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/laserpic1.JPG" width=250 height=188 border=0 alt="pic of target_laser"></center> <br><br>First thing you need to do is decide where you want the laser and what you want to use it for. The laser can either be <b>triggered</b> or <b>start on</b>. If you want it to be turned on then you need to <b>give the target_laser a targetname</b> and make some kind of trigger to start the laser. If you want  the laser to start on the just <b>set the start_on spawnflag</b>. The laser can either shoot in a direction or shoot at a target. If you want the laser to shoot in a direction other then anything horizontal or up and down then your going to have to have it shoot at a target. This target must be an <b>info_notnull</b>.<br><br> <center><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/6pic1.GIF" width=125 height=318 border=0 alt="pic1"></center> <br><br> There are 5 colors you can choose from: <b>red, green, blue, yellow, and orange</b>. Just set the spawnflag of the color you want. You can also have larger lasers by setting the <b>spawnflag big</b>. If you want the laser to take off more damage then set the key value pair <b>dmg <i>n</i></b> where <i>n</i> is the amount of damage the laser takes off. <br><br>Moving lasers work just like the example above except the <b>target_laser must be targeted to a func_train.</b> And of course the func_train must be connected to multiple path_corners so it will move. The laser will follow the func_train. <br><br> There are some very cool things you can use lasers for. You can use them for doors, for traps, etc. On the <a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/maps/t_laser.zip">example map</a> I have made examples of 4 kinds of uses of a target_laser. One as a door opened with a button, another using info_notnulls to create diagonal lasers, another with a func_timer to make a laser that blinks off and on, and one using a func_train to make a moving laser. If you have any other questions on a target_laser then please post them on the <a href="http://forums.gamedesign.net">RUST Forums</a><br><br>

<a name="target_lightramp"><b>target_lightramp</b></a>
<BR><BR>
 - The <B>target_lightramp</B> entity is another easy entity to use. What it does is makes a light fade in or fade out. I actually don't really remember seeing this used in quake2 but it is such a sutle effect that I just probably didn't notice. <br><br> The <B>first</B> thing you need to do is do create the light that you want to fade in or fade out. Give it a <B>light</B> value. This light value will be the maximum the brightness of the light will be when it is all the way faded in. <br><br> The <B>second</B> thing you need to do is decide if you want the light to start dark and become bright or start bright and become dark. If you want to the light to start dark then you need to set the spawnflag <B>start_off</B> on the light entity. If you want the light to start light and become dark then you need to have the start_off spawnflag off. You must also <B>give the light a targetname</B>. Lets just give it a targetname of light. <B>targetname light</B>. <br><br> Next you need to make the actual <B>target_lightramp</B> entity. It doesn't matter where it goes because it will not be visible. The first thing you need to do to the target_lightramp is to <B>give it a target to the light</B>. target light. While your at do also <B>give the target_lightramp a targetname</B>. Lets give it a targetname of ramp. This is because the lightramp doesnt start on and must be triggered by another entity, but we will get to that in just a minute. There are two key value pairs that you can set for the target_lightramp. They are <B>speed</B> and <B>message</B>. <B>Speed</B> determines how many seconds it will take for the light to fade in or fade out. So if you have speed set to 20 then the light will gradually fade in  or fade out within 20 seconds. The message key value pair <B>must have 2 letters and only 2 letters</B>. These 2 letters determine the starting light level and the ending light level. The range of these letters is <B>a</B> to <B>z</B>. So if you want the light to fade in from dark to light then the message would be az. message az. if you want it to fade out from light to dark them the message would be za. message za. Just think of it as A getting brighter and brighter as it goes towards z, with z being the brightest. <br><br> There is also one spawnflag called <B>toggle</B> for the target_lightramp. If this is on and you have the target_lightramp triggered with a func_button or a trigger_multiple then if you trigger it again with the button or trigger_multiple it will turn on and turn off as many times as you trigger it. So in other words you can use it more then once.(turn the light on then turn it off) <br><br> The <B>last</B> thing you need to do is create the entity that will turn on the target_lightramp. This can be any kind of trigger you want. It all depends on the effect that you are looking for. You could use a <B>func_button</B> if you wanted it to be like a light switch that you could turn off and on. You could use a <B>trigger_once</B>, <B>trigger_multiple</B>, <B>trigger_always</B>, etc. You could even use a <B>func_timer</B> which would make the light fade in and fade out multiple times in row. So make the trigger entity that you wish to use and set the <B>target to the target_lightramp</B>. For this example it would be target=ramp. <br><br> That's all there is to a target_lightramp. Pretty cool little entity which can provide you with some very interesting effects. In the <a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/maps/t_lightramp.zip">example</a> map I included a target_lightramp that is triggered with a func_button. So the lightramp can be turned on or off. Any other questions please post them in the <a href="http://forums.gamedesign.net">RUST Forums</a><br><br>

<a name="target_secret"><b>target_secret</b></a>
<BR><BR>
When a map is loaded, Quake II counts up all of the <strong>target_secret</strong> entites in the map. When one of them is triggered, it adds 1 to the total secrets found. That's it. <br><br>
	
Anything that can trigger another event can trigger a target_secret. Since the entity is removed as it's used, you can even use a <strong>trigger_multiple</strong>, in which case it will trigger the secret on the first firing. Simply add a <strong>&quot;target&quot;</strong> key and value (let's use <strong>&quot;sec1&quot;</strong>) to the triggering event, and a <strong>&quot;targetname&quot;</strong>  and value (<strong>&quot;sec1&quot;</strong>) to the <strong>target_secret</strong>. You're done. 
<br>
You can also add a <strong>&quot;message&quot;</strong> key to a <strong>target_secret</strong>, and the message value will be displayed in the center of the screen upon discovery of the secret.

<a name="target_spawner"><b>target_spawner</b></a> <BR><BR>
- A <b>target_spawner</b> can be used for a number of things. What it actually does is makes an item of your choice appear at the location of the target_spawner. Any single item can be spawned. Even weapons and health. id didn't ever use the target_spawner for things like that though. They mainly used it to spawn gibs, insane people, and creatures. This entity is pretty simple once you figure out a few things. <br><br> There are <b>two</b> entities that must be used to get the target_spawner to work properly. There must be the actual <b>target_spawner</b> and <b>some kind of entity</b> that will actually trigger the target_spawner into working like a func_timer or a trigger_once. <br><br> Now for an example:<br> Lets make a trap that will drop soldiers into a pool of lava.<br><br> The <b>first</b> thing we need to make is the tube coming from the ceiling that will drop the soldiers into the lava and the actual pool of lava. Now we need to put a <b>target_spawner</b> inside of the tube coming from the ceiling. Now we need to specify what the target_spawner will spawn. This is the part that most people get stuck on. Instead of actually targeting a misc_insane entity <b>you must set the target of the target_spawner to the name of the entity that you want to spawn.</b> So therefore in this example we would set <b>target=misc_insane</b>. <br><br> Next you need to create a entity that will start the target_spawner. Lets <b>give the target_spawner a targetname of lavapool</b>. targetname=lavapool. Now let's use a <b>func_timer</b> to actually spawn the misc_insane. <b>Set the target of the func_timer to the target_spawner</b>. target=lavapool. Also be sure that you set the <b>turn_on</b> spawnflag for the func_timer. Unless you want to make it so you can turn it on with another trigger like a <b>func_button</b>. If you were to do this then you would just give the func_timer a targetname and target it with the func_button. <br><br> There are some key value pairs that you can set for a target_spawner to get some different effects. They are <b>speed</b> and <b>angle</b>. <b>Speed</b> is the speed that the item will come out of the target_spawner. <b>If speed is not set then the item will be dropped</b>. <b>Angle</b> is the direction that the item will be spawned and if speed is set then it is the direction the item will be thrown.<br><br> One of the most common uses of a target_spawner is to spawn gibs and those insane soliders. There are 3 types of gibs. <b>misc_gib_arm</b>, <b>misc_gib_leg</b>, and <b>misc_gib_head</b>. The names are pretty much self explanatory. Another entity that is commonly spawned on a few of the id levels is the <b>misc_insane</b> entity which is an insane solider.<br><br> There are many uses for a target_spawner. A trigger on one side of the level will spawn a creature on the other side of the level to surprise the player when he/she returns. You can even spawn health, weapons, and armor. Don't know what the use of that would be but I'm sure there are a few good ideas you guys can come up with.<br><br> As you can see target_spawner is a pretty simple entity to use. Just remember that you must have some sort of trigger to set off the target_spawner. Anything can be used...such as a trigger_once, func_timer, trigger_multiple, etc. It all depends on how you plan on using the target_spawner.<br><br> To understand the target_spawner more you can download the <a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/maps/t_spawner.zip">example</a> map.

<a name="target_speaker"><b>target_speaker</b></a> <BR><BR>
- The <b>target_speaker</b> entity is another one that will be used VERY often by a map designer and should be known very well. What it does is spawns all those crazy sounds you here in quake2. Like the humming of a generator, breaking of glass, water flowing, ships flying overhead, etc. I will attempt to show you how to use this entity...hopefully. <br><br>Creating the target_speaker - <br><br> A target_speaker should be placed where you want the sound to originate from. By default a target_speaker will not start on and will have to be triggered by another entity such as a trigger_once, trigger_multiple, func_button, or whatever you want the sound to be triggered by. If you want a window to set off the sound then you would create the func_explosive that would be the breaking window and add a target key and set it to the the target_speaker. There is a way to make the target_speaker to start on that I will explain in the spawnflags section. <br><br>Key Value Pairs - <br><br><b>Noise</b><br><br>Noise is the name and path of the actual sound that will be played. The trick to it, if you want to call it a trick, is that you must specify the directory path and the name of the sound. Here is a <b><a href="sounds.shtml">list</a></b> of all the sounds that you can use and their directory paths. A common thought is that you can only use the sounds in the world/ directory but this is simply not true. You can use <b>ANY</b> sound at <b>ANY</b> time. You will soon find out though that the sounds in the world directory will be used much more often. So for an example if we want the target_speaker to produce a pump sound then we would set noise=world/bigpump.wav.<br><br> <b>Things to remember:</b> <li>Every target_speaker <b>MUST</b> have a noise key.</li> <li>Case does not matter. xian.wav and XIAN.WAV will both work.</li> <br><br> <br> <b>attenuation</b> <br><br> attenuation is the distance the sound will travel before fading out. There are 4 different levels of attenuation: <li><b>-1</b> : No fade off, the whole level will hear the sound</li> <li><b>1</b> : Normal fighting sounds. This is also the default attenuation for normal sounds.</li> <li><b>2</b> : idle sound level. </li> <li><b>3</b> : ambient sound level. Default attenuation for target_speaker entities that have the spawnflag looped-on set.</li> a value of 0 for attenuation will default to 1. <br><br><b>volume</b><br><br>Volume is pretty self explanatory. Volume levels can be values of 0.0 to 1.0. 1.0 being the loudest. If volume is left blank then the default volume is set to 1. A volume of .1 will barely  be audible. If there are multiple target_speaker entities with the same sound playing at the same time then the volume will increase beyond normal but excessive target_speakers will do nothing beyond a certain point. <br><br>Spawnflags - <br><br><b>looped-on</b><br><br>When looped-on is set then the sound will start on when the level is started and stay on until triggered. Thus the sound will loop over and over again until triggered and turned off. Sounds that are looped-on <b>always</b> have an attenuation of 3 and a volume of 1 and can <b>not</b> be changed. <br><br><br><b>looped-off</b><br><br>Looped-off is the opposite of looped-on naturally. The sound will start off and then when trigger will start and stay on. As with a looped_on sound they always will have an attenuation of 3 and a volume of 1 and can <b>not</b> be changed. <br><br><b>reliable</b><br><br>reliable is used when you have a very important sound that player must hear, like for crucial voiceovers. It makes the sound that is marked as reliable to override all the other sounds that are playing at the same time. <br><br>Uses of the Target_Speaker - There are virtually unlimited uses of the target_speaker entity. Of course you are going to want to use a lot of the world/ sounds with breaking glass, moving trains, computers humming, etc. But there are also uses of the non world/ sounds. Like some of the monster sounds at random areas to create a freaky feel of the level. There is an example of this on the <a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/maps/t_speaker.zip">example</a> map.<br><br> Well anyways if you still don't understand please post your questions to the <a href="http://forums.gamedesign.net">RUST Forums</a><br><br>

<a name="target_splash"><b>target_splash</b></a>
<BR><BR>
 - first thing you need to do is open your favorite editor and make a small room with nothing in it. Decide where you want the splash of particles and create a <B>trigger_splash</B> entity. <br><br> Now you need to give the <B>trigger_splash</B> a targetname. For this example lets give the entity a <B>target_name of splash1</B><br><br>Now we must specify what kind of spark you want. There are 6 different kinds. 1) sparks<br>2) blue water<br>3) brown water<br>4) slime<br>5) lava<br>6) blood<br><br>To set this use the keyname sounds and set it to whichever you want from above. For this example we are going to set <B>sounds=4</B> for slime. <br><br> The next step is to set the number of sparks you want. For this example we are going to make it 2. so set <B>count=2</B> for the trigger_splash entity. <br><br> We arent done yet though. To get the sparks to actually appear and work right you must create a <B>func_timer</B>. This is what actually spawns the sparks. It doesnt matter where you make this entity so just make it anywhere on the level and <B>set the target of this func_timer to the trigger_splash</B>. So in this example we would set <B>target=splash1</B>. If you want the sparks to start on then be sure to set the spawnflag <B>start_on</B>. Below is my some shots from my example using multiple trigger_splashes to make the acid look like it is bubbling, etc. first 2 shots are from the editor(bsp), last one is from the game.

<a name="target_temp_entity"><b>target_temp_entity</b></a> <BR><BR>
- The <b>target_temp_entity</b> is one of the strangest entities available to level designers for quake2 but very very <b>cool</b>. In the game it was only used once in the level boss1. What it does is spawns some sort of sprite. You have <b>3</b> of them to choose from(that i know of). First is a green electrical type fire that gives off dynamic green light. Second is a pixel explosion that looks similar to fireworks. Third one is a badass cloud of particles that shoots up and then encaves on itself. My descriptions don't do them justice though, download the <a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/maps/t_tempent
.zip">example</a> map and check them out for yourself. I'll show you how you can use these cool effects in your levels below. <br><br>Creating the target_temp_entity<br><br> - First you have to decide where you want the sprite to spawn at. Place the <b>target_temp_entity</b> at this location.<br><br>Since it is a target_ entity it must be triggered by something else. So therefore you must trigger it with an entity such as a trigger_once, trigger_multiple, trigger_relay, trigger_always, func_button, func_timer etc.<br><br> Key Value Pairs - <br><br><b>style</b>There is only one key value pair that can be set for the target_temp_entity. It's called <b>style</b>. What is does is specifies the sprite that will be displayed. <b>These values MUST range from 17,18,20-22 or there will be an error and the game will crash.</b> I am not sure if there are any other values other then these, these were the only  ones I found to work. <br><br> Another thing you should know is that style 22 is the only one used in the id levels and is the only one that has a sound that is played when it is triggered. Style 20 and 21 <b>MUST</b> have a target_speaker used to get sound(if you want sound). Here are some screenshots of 3 of the different styles: <br><br> <center><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/t_tempent1.JPG" width=300 height=225 border=0 alt="style 20"><br>style 20<br><br><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/ttemp_ent2.JPG" width=300 height=225 border=0 alt="style 21"><br>style 21<br><br><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/ttemp_ent3.JPG" width=300 height=225 border=0 alt="style 22"><br>style 22</center> <br><br><b>17</b> is the rocket explosion, <b>18</b> is the grenade explosion.(thanks obama) Uses of the target_temp_entity - <br><br> This entities uses are visual and just for looks but very very cool. You could have big generators that give off the electrical cloud of style 22. You could have a trap that would set off a target_temp_entity under the feet of the player and disintegrate him. There are numerous cool and unique uses for this entity that all of you guys/gals can up with.</blockquote> There is an example of the 3 different styles on the <http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/maps/t_tempent.zip">example map.</a> <br><br> if you still don't understand please post your questions to the <a href="http://forums.gamedesign.net">RUST Forums</a> <br><br>

<blockquote>
	<h3>Trigger Entites</h3>
</blockquote>
	
<!-- Start description -->
<p><a name="#trigger_always"><b>trigger_always</b></a> - <br>
	
This is just a trigger that is always on and starts on when the level begins. The other keys you can set are <b>target</b>, <b>killtarget</b> and <b>delay</b> (default 0.2).<br><br>
	
<p><a name="#trigger_counter"><b>trigger_counter</b></a> - <br>
	
	This is a trigger that allows for multiple inputs. What this means is that you can have a door that only opens when 2 or more buttons are pushed. This is just once example though. The trigger_counter could trigger anything. You could set it up so the player would have to use 2 [insert you favorite item here] with a computer or something which in turn destroys a bunch of walls.<br><br>
	
	There are only 3 keys that you have to set. <b>Count</b>, <b>target</b>, and <b>targetname</b>.<br><br></p>
	
	<blockquote>
	  <p>
	  <b>1. Count</b> is the amount of actions that is required before the trigger_counter triggers its target. So if you have a door that must have 2 buttons pressed to open then you would give the trigger_counter a count of <br>
        <br>
	    
	  <b>2. Target</b> is the target of the entity that will be triggered when the specific amount of actions is performed on the trigger_counter.	  </p>
	  <p><b>3. Targetname</b> is self explanatory, but I just wanted to stress that the trigger_counter <b>MUST</b> have a targetname. For example, Lets say you want a door that will be opened by pressing 2 buttons. First you would make the door and give it a targetname of door1. Next make the trigger_counter and set the target to door1, the count to 2, and targetname to count1. Now create the 2 buttons and give each of them a target to count1. That's it! Pretty simple huh?<br>
        <br>
      </p>
	</blockquote>
    There is one spawnflag that can be used with the trigger_counter which is <b>nomessage</b>. By default, when the buttons in the example above are pressed, the messages, "1 more", "2 more", and "sequence complete" would be printed. nomessage disables these messages.<br>
    <br>
	
	
	<p><a name="#trigger_elevator"><b>trigger_elevator</b></a> - 
	
	<br>This a very difficult entity to master and I would only recommend going through this tutorial if you are a pretty experienced level designer. What it is basically an elevator. That's the easiest way I can explain it. Lets say there are 4 floors. You hit a button on the 4th floor and the platform will come to the forth floor. Hit a button on the 3rd floor and the platform will come to the third floor or however you want to set it to do. There are other easier ways to implement an elevator by using a <a href="../func_train/func_train.shtml" target="_top">func_train</a> but the trigger_elevator is more functional as working like a true elevator but again I stress that it is a very difficult entity to master.<br><br>
	
	Entities that can be used with the trigger_elevator:
	
	<blockquote>
		<p><li><a href="../func_train/func_train.shtml" target="_top">see func_train</a>    
	  	<li><a href="../misc/misc.shtml">path_corner</a>    
	  	<li><a href="../func_button/func_button.shtml">func_button</a><br><br></p>
    </blockquote>	
	
	Make sure you are familiar how all these entities work before attempting the trigger_elevator<br><br>
	
	 <ol>
	   <li>The first thing you need to do is to place the trigger_elevator entity somewhere in the level. This is not the actual elevator. In fact...this entity is <b>not</b> visual in the map, so it does not matter where you put this entity.</li><br>
	   
       <li>Now you need to <b>give the trigger_elevator a targetname and a target</b>. For this example lets give it a <b>targetname of elevator</b> and a <b>target of train</b> which will be the actual elevator. We havnt made the actual elevator object yet though. we will get to that next.</li><br>
	   
       <li>Now we will create the object that will be the actual elevator. Now you need to decide how you want your elevator to look. It could be simply a 1 brush platform or you could go all out and it could be a full blown 200 brush detailed elevator. Does not matter. When you are finished designing the elevator select it and turn it into a <b>func_train</b>. Yep, you heard it right...a func_train....I'll explain in a minute.</li><br>
	   
	   <li>Now give the func_train you just made a targetname and a target. The targetname for this example will be train. The target will be to the first <b>path_corner</b>. Lets call this p1. So lets recall what we have done so far: We have a <b>trigger_elevator</b> entity that is linked to a <a href="../func_train/func_train.shtml" target="_top">func_train</a> entity which is linked to a <a href="../misc/misc.shtml">path_corner</a> entity that we have <b>not</b> made yet.</li><br>
	   
	   <li>Now we need to create the actual path the elevator will follow. These will be <b>path_corner</b> entities. We will place one at each area the elevator will stop. So if there are 4 floors then we will have to make 4 path_corners. So place path_corners at each floor the elevator will be stoping on <b>INCLUDING</b> the bottom floor. It will take awhile to get the placing of the path_corners just right so that the elevator will look right.You can get them precisely placed by positioning the exact origin of the path_corner at the exact lower left corner (both top and front views) of any func_train's *bounding box*.  In the case of s nice rectangular train, this is incredibly easy to be absolutely precise.(thanks <a href="mailto:jloftus@sprintmail.com">Freznor</a>)</li><br>
	   
	   <li> Now we are going to give each path_corner a targetname and a pathtarget. Give the first one a targetname of p1, second one of p2, all the way to p4 if you will be having a 4 floor elevator. Each path_corner will also <b>HAVE</b> to have the key value pair <b>pathtarget</b>. What this is is a unique name of the elevator stop that the path_corner represents. So on this example lets say there are 4 floors. The first path_corner on the bottom floor will have a <b>pathtarget of stop1</b>. The second floor path_corner will have a <b>pathtarget of stop2</b>, third will have a <b>pathtarget of stop3</b>, and the fourth floor will have a <b>pathtarget of stop4</b>.</li><br>
	   
	   <li>Now we are going to create the <b>func_buttons</b> that will trigger the elevator. So this means that <b>each floor will have a func_button</b>. So we will create 4 func_buttons for an elevator that will be stoping on 4 floors.</li><br>
	   
	   <li> Now you must target each func_button to the trigger_elevator entity. So every func_button will have the key value pair <b>target elevator</b>, because we gave our trigger_elevator a targetname of elevator.</li><br>
	   
	   <li>The final thing we have to do is give each func_button a key value pair of <b>pathtarget</b>. This should be set to the cooresponding <b>targetname</b> of the <b>path_corner</b> that you want the elevator to stop on when the button is pressed. Recall that we have 4 path_corners each with a targetname of p1, p2, p3, and p4 respectfully. So if we wanted the elevator to take us from the top floor to the bottom floor we would set the pathtarget of the func_button on the fourth floor to p1, which is the targetname of the path_corner that is on the bottom floor. Pretty simple huh? yeah right.<br><br>
       </li>
	 </ol>
	 As you can see this is a very difficult entity to use but it is very useful and very cool. It was also very hard for me to figure out since there is no comments or anything in the code. I had to decompile a bsp file and see how id did it in one of the mine levels. Not fun. =) Here is a diagram that I might help you out a bit<br><br>

	<p><a name="#trigger_gravity"><b>trigger_gravity</b></a> - <br>
	
	This entity at first I didn't think it worked because it was <b>NEVER</b> used in any of the id levels.(whole level gravity is set with the <a href="../worldspawn_and_more/worldspawn_and_more.shtml">worldspawn</a> entity.) It was not until I saw over at <a href="http://spq2.telefragged.com/" target="_top">Akuma's SPQ</a> that it worked. The bad thing about it is that <b>it only effects spawned entities, gernades, and gibs</b>.It has NO effect on the player. Its very simple though.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Creating the trigger_gravity</b><br>
      <br>
      First thing you need to do is just create a brush that will cover the entire area that you want to have a different gravity. It would also be a good practice to give it the trigger texture. Now turn it into the trigger_gravity entity. Pretty simple huh?<br>
      <br>
      Key Value Pairs<br>
      <br>
      <b>gravity</b> - <br>
      There is only 1 key value pair and it is pretty self explanatory. <b>gravity</b> will be the value you want the gravity to change to. Default gravity is 1, so if you want a room with low gravity set it to something like .5 or .3. If you want a room with no gravity, in which a grenade will just keep going and going, then set the gravity to 0. A negative value will make the grenades and the gibs go towards the ceiling. A real positive value will make the grenades and gibs immediately shoot towards the ground. But remember though, <b>this ONLY effects spawned entities, grenades, and gibs.</b> Nothing else is effected.<br>
      <br>
      Uses of the trigger_gravity - <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Since the trigger_gravity entity is so limited there are not many uses for it but to confuse the player. You could have a creature that is spawned and falls from the ceiling and it would fall very slow if the gravity was low. You could have spawned gibs fly across the room very slowly. Pretty strange huh?<br>
      <br>

	<li><p><a name="#trigger_hurt"><b>trigger_hurt</b></a> - Another pretty easy entity to use. Its an area that you specify that when the player comes in contact with it he/she will take damage. You can specify the damage by setting the key value pair <b>dmg</b>. There are a number of spawnflags for a trigger_hurt. They are <b>start_off, toggle, silent, no_protection, and slow.</b> start_off and toggle are for trigger_hurt entities that are triggered. So you could have an area where the player wasn't taking damage but then one of their actions triggers something that causes the player to take constant damage until he/she is out of the area of the trigger_hurt. There are a lot of uses for this. <b>Slow</b> simply decreases the frequency of the damage taken. trigger_hurt can also be used for setting traps..like the floor opens and the player falls into a pit of spikes. just draw a brush covering the tips of the spikes and make it into a trigger_hurt.<br><br>

It also has 1 more key value pair and 1 other spawnflag.<br><br>The new key value pair is <b>wait</b>, which determines the amount of time to wait before the trigger will trigger its target again when touched by the player. An interesting thing to note is that if you assign a value of -1 to this, you will effectively have transformed your trigger_multiple into a trigger_once. Not much point in doing that but anyway... :-)<br><br>The new spawnflags is <b>monster</b>. What monster does when enabled is allows a monster or the player to use the trigger. This is opposed to not_player which allows only monsters to use the trigger. For some reason the spawnflag monster does not work for trigger_once. Strange.<br><br>As for all the other keys and spawnflags, just look at the trigger_once. They behave in the same way except for the 3 differences I mentioned above.<br><br>
        
	<p><a name="#trigger_once"><b>trigger_once</b></a> - <br>
	    
	If you have any editing experience at all then you probably know how to use this entity. What it does is triggers an event when another entity such as the player or a monster(we will go over this in a minute) touches it, but only 1 time. One thing you should know when making the brush that will be the trigger_once is that all the trigger entities that we are going to go over in this tutorial are not visable in the level so it doesn't matter where you place them. Also it is good editing practice to give the trigger_once or any other non visable brush the trigger texture. This makes it easier to see and organize in your level editor. The key value pairs for trigger_once are <b>target</b>, <b>targetname</b>, <b>killtarget</b>, <b>sounds</b>, <b>message</b>, and <b>delay</b>.<br><br><b>Target</b> is the name of the corresponding targetname that will be triggered when the trigger_once is touched by the player or a monster(see below). So if you want the trigger_once to open a door then you need to give the door a targetname of something like door1 and then set the target of the trigger_once to door1.<br><br><b>Sounds</b> is the sound that the trigger will play when the trigger_once is touched. This can be set to 0,1,2 or 3. Each corresponding to a different sound. 0 is the default "beep beep" sound and 3 is no sound. If you use 3, you will get an annoying but harmless error message in the game saying "couldn't load sound/misc/trigger1.wav" but the trigger will still work and won't make any sound. This is due to a bug in the entity code. If you open the PAK file, you will see that sound/misc/trigger1.wav doesn't exist and that's the reason why the game complains.<br><br><b>Message</b> will print to the screen whatever it is set to when the trigger_once is triggered. So if  you want the trigger_once to print "door was opened" then you would set message to "door was opened". Pretty simple. Remember to use \n to break to the next like or you will run out of space.<br><br><b>Delay</b> is the amount of time between the touching of the trigger and the actual triggering taking place. So if you have a trigger_once targeted to a target_explosion, setting delay=2 will create a 2 second delay between the touching and the explosion.<br><br><br><br><b>Targetname</b> is used along with the <b>triggered</b> spawnflag (see below).<br><br><br><br><b>Killtarget</b> will remove any entity that has a matching targetname. You can target pretty much any entity you want with this, including monsters. If you target a monster with killtarget, it won't gib or anything, it will just disappear.<br><br>The 2 spawnflags that can be turned on for a trigger_once are <b>not_player</b> and <b>triggered</b>.<br><br><b>not_player</b> is not listed on any of the entity references but it is there. Just set the <b>spawnflag 2</b> and not_player will be turned on. What not_player does is makes it so the player has no effect on this trigger_once. Something like a monster must touch it and trigger it. This can be used for a variety of cool things. A monster could trigger a trap on the player or could spawn more monsters that would actually come to the place of the trigger. This could give the effect of the monster calling for reinforcements. Very cool.<br><br>The <b>triggered</b> spawnflag makes it so the trigger_once must be triggered itself to be turned on. So therefore, if this spawnflag is on then the trigger_once must have a <b>targetname</b>. What you should remember though is that the trigger_once that is triggered by another entity will NOT actually trigger its own targets when it is triggered. The trigger_once will only become "live" or "enabled" if you will. So after it is triggered, the player will have to touch it for it to trigger its targets. That sure was a mouthful. =) That's about as easy as I can explain it though. An example of a way to use this is the following:<br><br>Lets say that you have a huge level in which the player walks across a bridge to get into the strogg base. Later near the end of the level after he defeats the boss alien he unknowingly walks across a trigger_once that in turn makes another trigger_once near the bridge live. The player now has to exit the base and walk back across the same bridge. Well..the trigger_once that was just made live triggers the bridge to explode as the player is walking over it and he falls into the river getting into more trouble. Hope this kind of helped. I know it's kind of stupid though. hehe.<br><br>
	        
	<p><a name="#trigger_push"><b>trigger_push</b></a> - <br>
	    
	This is the same as it was in quake1. Use it to push the player in a given direction. You can specify the speed by setting the the key value pair <b>speed</b>. You can also make the push only work once by setting the <b>spawn_flag push_once</b>.<br><br>
	        
	<p><a name="#trigger_relay"><b>trigger_relay</b></a> - <br>
	    
	This is used to relay actions. This can be used for a variety of effects and is used very often in the id levels. a trigger_relay is not triggered when touched so therefore it must have a targetname and must be triggered by something else to work. It must also have a target. The other keys that can be set is <b>delay</b>, which determines the amount of time to pause before triggering it's target, <b>killtarget</b> and <b>message</b>. There are <b>NO</b> spawnflags. An example use of this would be to have a crate that when shot explodes, but when it explodes it triggers more explosions in the surrounding areas. What you would do is create the func_explosive crate and give it a target to a trigger_relay which in turn would target multiple target_explosions that would all have the same targetname. Or you could target several trigger_relay's all with different delay values that each in turn target their own func_explosive crates so you can have a sequence of timed explosions for cool effects. Hope this explains it a bit.<br><br>

    </ul><h1 id="39" name="39" class="book-h2">Turret</h1><ul><h3>Quake 2 Turret Entities</h3><p>

	<!-- Start description -->

	<p><a name="#turret_base"><b>turret_base</b></a> - This enitity along with <b>turret_breach</b> and <b>turret_driver</b> all must be used together to create those cool gun turrets that are in 2 of the quake2 levels. These entities are by far the hardest I have come across to use in a level and only advanced level editors should attempt this. I would of never of figured it out if it wasn't for steve at the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/QuakeLab/QuakeLab2/" target="_top"><b>quakelab</b></a> telling me to specify an origin for the turret_breach and turret_base. We will get to that though in due time.<br><br>
	
	The first thing you need to do is to <b>create the gun</b>. This might take awhile to make it look good. Here is a shot of the id one:<br>
	
	<br><center><img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/turret/gunpic1.JPG" width=250 height=143 border=0 alt="gunpic"></center><br><br>
	
	You must also make everything <b>orientated towards angle 0</b>(straight right from a top view), The trick is to kind of <b>make it into 2 parts. The barrel and the base.</b> the barrel is the part that is going to be the turret_breach and the base is going to be the turret_base. Also take into consideration that the creature driving the gun will be standing on the turret_breach so actually <b>the turret_breach will include the barrel and the platform that the turret_driver will be standing on.</b> Here is another visual example to show you what the hell I am talking about:<br><br><center>here is the barrel which includes the barrel and the platform for the driver to stand on(<b>turret_breach</b>)<br>
	
	<img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/turret/barrel.jpg" width=250 height=52 border=0 alt="barrel"><br><br>
	
	Here is the base(<b>turret_base</b>)<br>
	
	<img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/turret/base.JPG" width=250 height=146 border=0 alt="turret_base"><br><br>
	
	Here is the barrel(<b>turret_breach</b>) and the base(<b>turret_base</b>) together<br>
	
	<img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/turret/both.jpg" width=250 height=70 border=0 alt="turret_breach and turret_base"></center><br><br>
	
	Once you get these 2 parts made then you must <b>select the barrel and make it a turret_breach, and select the base and make it a turret_base.</b> Now you must <b>give the turret_breach a targetname</b>. So for this example lets give it a targetname of breach. <b>targetname=breach</b>. The turret_breach and the turret_base go together so <b>they must be teamed</b>. To do this give each of these entities the key value pair <b>team</b> with the same value. For this example lets give them a team name of gun. So on <b>both</b> the turret_breach and the turret_base there should be a key value pair of <b>team gun</b> Now you must decide which direction you want your gun to point in the game and <b>set the key value pair angle to what ever direction you want the gun to point.</b> <b>BOTH</b> the turret_breach and the turret_base should have the same angle. For this example we will set the angle to be 180. <b>angle 180</b>.<br><br>
	
	Next thing you must do is create the target that the gun will shoot at. To do this you must <b>create an info_notnull entity and place it at the tip of the barrel and give it a targetname.</b> For this example our info_notnull will have a targetname of tip. <b>targetname tip</b>. Then <b>set the target of the turret_breach to the info_notnull</b>. <b>target=tip</b>.<br><br>
	
	Next thing you need to do is to <b>create the turret_driver and target it to the turret_breach.</b> target=breach. Place the turret_drive where you want him to be standing(on the platform you made him on the turret_breach)<br><br>
	
	Now to the part that I couldn't figure out but steve at the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/quakelab/quakelab2/" target="_top">quakelab</a> helped me out on. For the turret_breach and the turret_base <b>you must have a brush set as an origin brush</b>. These will keep gun from rotating all around the room and looking really messed up. So the turret_breach <b>must</b> have an origin brush and the turret_base <b>must</b> have an origin brush. To make a brush an origin brush you must <b>change the surface property</b> of that brush and set the origin flag. This is done differently for each editor. Check your manual. It is better to select origin brushes that for breach and the base that are near each other. Here is a diagram of what brushes i made into origin brushes.<br><br>

	Thats about all there is too it. As you can see this is a <b>very</b> difficult entity to use. Not very fun at all. I urge you to download my <a href="/content/quake2/tutorials/turret/rust7.zip">example</a> map if you are going to try do this. If you still have problems post your question in the <a href="http://forums.gamedesign.net/forums">discussion</a> board and I will try to help you out.<br><br>

</ul><h1 id="41" name="41" class="book-h2">Worldspawn</h1><ul><h3>Quake 2 Worldspawn Entities</h3><p>

<p><a name="worldspawn"><b>worldspawn</b></a> - This entity has got to be one of the easiest entities to use, (hence one of the easiest tutorials to write, heh) but it adds immensely to the completeness of a level.<br><br>

If you've compiled and run a map, you've already used worldspawn. There are, however, a few keys that you can add to it, that change the environment throughout the map. These are: <br><br>

<blockquote>		
	<strong>sky -</strong> 
	
<blockquote>
	This key changes the environment map for the level. In order to use it, add the <strong>&quot;sky&quot;</strong> key, and give it the value of the sky you wish to use. The environment maps included in Quake II are <strong>unit1_</strong> through<strong> unit9_</strong> and <strong>space1</strong>. 
</blockquote>
	
	<strong>skyaxis -</strong> <blockquote>
	
	If you would like to have a rotating sky, like in the final boss level, you'll need to define an axis for the sky to rotate around. Simply add a key of <strong>&quot;skyaxis&quot;</strong> and give it a vector using three numbers (vectors are the same values that define projectile paths, and line of sight for monsters.) If you don't quite know vectors, just play around with the numbers until you find one you like. Don't use 0 0 0 however, as this will give you a hall of mirrors effect. (doesn't define a vector, so it doesn't draw the sky) 0 0 1 will give a flat rotation.</blockquote><br><br>
	
	<strong>skyrotate -</strong>
	
<blockquote>
	This controls the speed of rotation for the sky. Add the <strong>&quot;skyrotate&quot;</strong> key, and give it a value in degrees per second.
</blockquote>
	
	<strong>sounds -</strong>
	
<blockquote>
		This is the CD track that will play during the level. Add the <strong>&quot;sounds&quot;</strong> key, and give it a track number.
</blockquote>
	
	<strong>gravity -</strong> 

<blockquote>
	This controls the gravity level. Default is 800. The gravity in the <strong>Comm Sattelite</strong> level is set at 100. 
</blockquote>
	
	<strong>message -</strong> 
	
<blockquote>
	This is the text that will appear at the console when you begin the level, and in the computer. Anything more than 32 characters, and you'll get a warning at the beginning of the level. Add a key of <strong>&quot;message&quot;</strong> and give it a value of whatever the title of 			the level is. 
</blockquote> <br>
</blockquote>
