Kenn Hoekstra of Raven was gracious enough to answer a few questions I had for him regarding editing Soldier Of Fortune. For those of you who don't know what GHOUL is or some of the other SoF specific features we talk about go to the <A href=http://www.ravensoft.com/sof.shtml>Soldier of Fortune</A> page at <A href=http://www.ravensoft.com/>Ravensoft</A> and educate yourself on the cool features of this game!
<BR><BR>

<B>Rust:</B> What editor are your level designers using for SoF? (ie QERadiant etc)
<BR><BR>
<B>KH:</B> We’re using a modified version of QERadiant that we affectionately call SOFRadiant.
<BR><BR>

<B>Rust:</B> Will you be releasing the editor with the game?
<BR><BR>
<B>KH:</B> The editor and tools will be released on the net after SoF’s release.  They will not be included on the CD/with the game itself.
<BR><BR>

<B>Rust:</B> If so what will Raven be doing to support the level-design/Mod community?
<BR><BR>
<B>KH:</B> We will continue to be supportive of the level-design/Mod community for Soldier of Fortune the same way we’ve supported modifications of our previous games.   We’re generally good at answering people’s questions personally or on the message boards and our tools include useful documentation.  We’ll do whatever we can to encourage mods and to help out the mod makers.
<BR><BR>

<B>Rust:</B> How does the terrain engine relate to user made SoF levels?
<BR><BR>
<B>KH:</B> The terrain engine is pretty simple to use, but clunky at the same time.  It’s simply a matter of the designer filling in a table of information and setting variables to run a script.
<BR><BR>

<B>Rust:</B> What changes does GHOUL mean to level designers from traditional Q2 model usage in maps? (How are multiple skins handled/assigned in the editor? What does Lights Inside Ghoul Models mean? etc)
<BR><BR>
<B>KH:</B> GHOUL is more a tool for artists, modelers and animators than for designers.  Specific enemy types (skins included) can be placed in the world by level designers, but for the purpose of spawning enemies in, I believe that skins are assigned randomly.  Lights inside GHOUL models means that certain models add dynamic light to the world.  For example, the police car in the opening cinematic of the game is a GHOUL model and the flashing lights on the top are actually part of the model, not separate entities.

I'd like to that Kenn for taking time out of his busy schedule to answer these questions and provide us with the good news that we will be able to make our own SoF projects. Cheers!</body></html>
