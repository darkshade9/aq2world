Making levels in a 3D environment is simple.  I would even go so far as to say that making a good level is simple.  After all, what makes a good level? If a level conforms to the few hard rules of level design - a place to start; in single player, a place to end; and no technical errors, such as (in the case of Quake-engine games,) leaks - it only stands a few textures away from being &quot;good,&quot; as &quot;good&quot; is open to interpretation.  All that is required of the mapper is some level of technical proficiency.<br><br>

Technical proficiency is a learned skill.  Anyone who has the basic skills of memorization that we all learned in elementary school can make a level.  Some people learn slower, others faster.  Some remember details easily; others need to constantly look back through references (Like me.)  Given patience, however, technical proficiency is the easiest part of level design.  Lucky thing, because it is also the most fundamental.<br><br>

The difficult thing about learned skills is applying them.  This is where the sand becomes the pearl.  What do we make with all of these brushes and entities once we've learned what they are?  How do we make them into something that someone else would want to play?  Well, there are even fewer rules here.  In fact, there's only one: enjoyment.  Everything in level design is dependent on enjoyment.  Some things add to enjoyment, such as good layout, interesting architecture, and careful consideration when it comes down to placement of items and monsters.  Other things can detract from enjoyment, like high face counts, vis errors, bad item placement, and &quot;no way out&quot; architecture.  Pro or con, it's all about enjoyment, and enjoyment is all about guidelines.  There are no rules.
<br><br>

There are many other sources of information on all of the things discussed above, so I won't go into them here.  This article is not about the technical aspects of what makes a good level or even the aesthetics and dynamics of what makes a fun level.  There is a third aspect of editing.  One that I have yet to see discussed in great depth.  One which I will attempt to put my finger on - here and in articles to follow - and that is the element of style.
<br><br>
When I say &quot;style,&quot; I'm not talking about the style of the level in question per se, but more along the lines of how the level conveys the personal style of the author, while maintaining an illusion.  The line between an author's personal style and downright intrusiveness is a blurry one, and this is where the technical and aesthetic come into play.  If, at any time, there is a breach in the illusion - such as technical errors or gameplay errors - no matter how slight, it becomes an intrusion.  The author instantly comes to mind.  The same goes for fancy architecture or &quot;wow&quot; dynamics, like an extremely complicated door or lift that was put in for no reason other than to impress somebody.  On the opposite side of the coin, an author has to know when to jump their own tracks and throw in something unexpected.  A perfect example of this is <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/retroquake/epoch.htm">&quot;The Epoch Turning&quot;</a> by Andrew Smith.  I won't spoil it by telling you exactly what I'm talking about if you haven't played it, but let's just say that it was all about execution.  It's a case of knowing exactly what to put where, and being willing to take the time to make sure that it works.  It means painstaking attention to detail, while always keeping in mind the overall theme of the level.  If there is any doubt as to whether or not something belongs in a level, it doesn't.  This requires a combination of humility and confidence that is difficult to attain, and is the mark of a true artist.  Other people are helpful when it comes to finding problems, but it is always up to the author in the end.

<br><br>
If there is only one rule when it comes to enjoyment, then there are none when it comes to style.  I don't even think there are very many guidelines.  For every guideline, there is one that opposes it, and in some cases, either one will work.  What I would like to do is explore these guidelines.  Break open each aspect of level design, look around inside, and see what's in there.  What I don't want to do, is even attempt to make a set of rules for what makes a level great.  So, I'll keep looking around, and writing about what I see, and hopefully it will get level authors (myself included) thinking about what can make their levels better.<br><br>
