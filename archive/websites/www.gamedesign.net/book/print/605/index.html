<b>NAME</b>: Joe<br>
<b>ALIAS</b>: m0pX,  m0p<br>

<b>BIOGRAPHY</b>:<br><br>

<b><i> - Description</i></b>:<br>

I'm masterofpuppets and I have been involved with computers for countless years ever since the Spectrum and C64 days. I am a programmer and a pc modder. I am also an amatuer mapper.<br><br>

<b><i> - Mapping Interests</i></b>:<br>

I map for Quake, Quake2, Quake3 (and games based on the engine), Half-Life and now Doom 3. I am not an amazing mapper to be honest, but I am very good in the architecture and texturing departments.<br><br>

I have been working in several tiny mods and map packs by members at TWHL and other mapping communities. I don't really have any released maps from games other than HL, though. I have very few finished maps around at the moment, mostly due to lazyness. Although, once I get involved in a certain map and I like what I have done so far, I usually continue and create a stunning map.<br><br>

<b><i> - Skills</i></b>:<br>

I am fairly skilled in computers and software. I am a fairly skilled C++ and PHP programmer. I have written a few programs here and there. I am quite skilled at photoshop and digital art, specialising in fire and nebula effects.<br><br>

I am involved in modding and overclocking pc's. I have built loads of pc's in my time and usually spend 1000s just to overclock and mod them. I currently use a hugely expensive P4EE system cooled with a refrigeration system.<br><br>

<b>PORTFOLIO:</b><br><br>

<b><i> - Work</i></b>:<br>
I don't have any serious released work at the moment but I am soon starting a Doom 3 mod which will start in development soon.<br><br>
 
This will be a real test of my skills. A new engine and a new editor. I do have a bit of unfinished work though.<br><br>

I was working on the small mod, HL: Donuts in which you play as Otis from Opposing Force. That eventually died. <a href="http://hldonuts.m0px.net">HL:Donuts official site</a> has a couple of screenshots from a map called Security-Breach which was going to be in the mod. You can download it here: <a href="http://cariad.co.za/twhl/mapvault_map.php?id=1380&dl=1">TWHL Map Vault Direct</a>. It's not the latest version, but it's pretty recent.<br><br>

<b><i>- Websites</i></b>:<br>
I run one website at the moment which I am currently rebuilding. <a href="http://m0pX.net">http://m0pX.net</a>. This version will be eventually replaced by the new version. Still, check out my forums.<br><br>
