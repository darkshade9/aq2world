<h3>The "angles" key/value pair</h3>

 <p>OK, this is a long story, but you goons are required to read the whole thing... 
	that's the price you pay for cool information. My 
	<a href="http://tarot.telefragged.com"> Tarot</a> teammate and spiritual advisor 
	Monsto Brukes wanted to simulate Q3 jump pads in Q2 for map testing purposes. 
	Tarot's bit_twiddling nerd guy (that's me) opened up the Q2 source and started to 
	plug in an elevation value. But wait... he found that trigger_push code refers to 
	the "angles" key... but that's not right he says... trigger_push just uses 
	"angle". Well it turns out id didn't trust you mapper goons to be able to do a 
	little simple trigonometry, so they published the input for trigger_push as 
	"angle" only, but the code does not have that limitation.</p>

 <p>The "angles" values are pitch (up/down), yaw (left/right) and roll (fall over). 
	If "angle" is specified for an entity, then the code automatically sets "angles" 
	to 0,angle,0... and these values are used for the entity. But what happens if 
	instead of specifying "angle" in the .map file, you set the three "angles"?... 
	heh heh... you know the answer, don't ya? And all it takes is a little math to 
	translate those angles into movement directions... but not to worry, Tarot's 
	bit_twiddling nerd has done that for you. The translations performed by the game 
	source end up making a positive pitch down from horizontal. Yaw is unaffected by 
	this, so you'd use the same angle you've previously used for the angle key. And 
	roll is ignored for trigger_push, which is a shame, really... it would be nice 
	to have a trigger_push that made you do flips. Anyhow... quick example, and I'm 
	sure you can take it from there. Say you want the trigger_push to push you up 60
	degrees from horizontal and to the west. Set "angles" to _60 180 0. That's it.</p>

 <p>So how do you go about using this info in your editor? If your editor allows you 
	to enter user_defined keys (qED, QERadiant, QuArk), you're all set. Just enter 
	"angles" for the key and "<_pitch> <yaw> 0" for the value. If you're using Tread, 
	open up quake2.gdf, find trigger_push, and enter the following below the "angle" 
	line:<br>
	<blockquote><pre>def_key : string : "angles" : "pitch yaw roll" : ""</pre></blockquote><!-- <br> -->
	If you're using WorldCraft, Mad Dog has already done the work for you... 
	<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~tonykat127/mapediting/fgd_q2.zip">get his new 
	.fgd file.</a> If you're using Qoole, stop. (ed. Iâ€™d have to agree.)</p>

 <p>One qualifier that could foul this up for you: If your editor forces an "angle" 
	key to be written to the .map file, "angles" will still work as long as it occurs 
	after the "angle" definition. So if you try this and you get the same old 
	trigger_push behavior, open up your .map file in a text editor, find the 
	trigger_push, and delete the "angle" line.<br>
	<br>
	The syntax for an 'angles' keyvalue is:<br>
	<blockquote><pre>"angles" "pitch yaw roll"</pre></blockquote><!-- <br> -->
	Pitch can be any number from _90 to 90; negative numbers "aim" up and positive 
	numbers "aim" down. Yaw can be virtually any positive number, generally 0_360 
	(this would be the same value one would typically use for 'angle'). Roll can be 
	any number from _180 to 180; this affects the "canted" view one can achieve with 
	an info_player_intermission. Depending on the entity, a "roll" value of anything 
	other than 0 can yield no result, an interesting result, or a result you want to 
	avoid.</p>
	
 <p>Some example entities by way of explanation:
	<ul type="square">
		<li><b>Ammo</b> - Ammo need not lie flat. If you want to put a box of ammo 
			on a tilted floor, or simulate an item amid a jumble of other debris you 
			can. Note that the bounding box of the ammo does not change position or 
			orientation, so you may need to work in a wedge_shaped mist brush in 
			there to get the visual effect just right. Giving values to all three 
			angles is fine.
			<br>&nbsp;
		<li><b>Player starts, deathmatch starts, teleporters</b> - DM spawn points 
			and teleporter/dest platforms can be canted just like ammo. However the 
			'angles' value translates into the direction the player looks when he 
			spawns. So if you want the player to spawn up on a high ledge, looking 
			down on the action, you could give the spawn point an 'angles' value of 
			"45 0 0", for example. Even if the player has freelook off and lookspring 
			on it works fine. I strongly advise against using a "roll" value of 
			anything other than 0, since the player gets stuck with the canted view. 
			Until he hits a teleporter dest which straightens him out anyway. Unless 
			of course you want to simulate drunkeness.
			<br>&nbsp;
		<li><b>Strogg ships, Vipers</b> - Simulate diving or launching ships. Or a 
			crashed misc_bigviper. Looks cool; use all 3 values. Advise the use of a 
			playerclip brush to avoid weird clipping problems with the misc_bigviper 
			model in the game.
			<br>&nbsp;
		<li><b>Banner</b> - All 3 values work, but the appearance is odd; so "roll" 
			has little value __ but a slight "pitch" effect could have its place I 
			suppose.
			<br>&nbsp;
		<li><b>Monsters</b> - Good for a laugh. Give a monster_soldier an 'angles' 
			keyvalue of "60 0 0" and he "swims" on the floor. Too bad monsters drown 
			in water. Death animations can be even funnier.
			<br>&nbsp;
		<li><b>Target_blasters</b> - Want a blaster that shoots up or down at an 
			angle? No problem. "Roll" values don't matter. Works with lasers too, if 
			you don't want to bother with an info_null. And it works with the 
			target_splash too.
			<br>&nbsp;
		<li><b>Doors and buttons</b> - This is very very cool. You can have
			multi_piece doors that move up/down at angles, and buttons that recess 
			properly into angled consoles. Figuring out 'lip' may be a problem; 
			I haven't experimented but I suspect that the game uses either a 
			horizontal or vertical orientation for calculating 'lip'; so I would
			avoid using _45 and 45 for "pitch", so you can get predictable results. 
			Again, "roll" doesn't matter.
			<br>&nbsp;
		<li><b>Weapons, keys, armor, etc</b> - Spinning crap seems to ignore 
			'angles'. Too bad.
	</ul>	
	Anyway these are some ideas. In order to use the 'angles' key properly in 
	Worldcraft, you should set 'angle' to '0'; this removes the 'angle' key from 
	the .map file. My .FGD prompts you for "pitch yaw roll" for entities which can 
	make use of "roll", and it prompts you for "pitch yaw 0" for entities which 
	can't.</p>
	
 <p>The team was so fired up about this that we built a fun DM map for you guys to 
	check out. We started out making a small tutorial sort of thing, but it got out 
	of hand pretty quickly and turned into the real deal: <br>
	<a href="http://tux.telefragged.com/file.pl?filename=jumpbch.zip&dir=telefragged/tarot/ryo/">
	You can download the map here (589Kb)</a>.<br>
	The map is an r_speeds hog, so if you don't have a 3D card please don't bother. 
	The .map file is included.</p>
