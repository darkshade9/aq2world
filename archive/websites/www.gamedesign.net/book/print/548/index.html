<b>Introduction:</b><br><br>

Compiling is probably the most important thing you must learn in mapping. This tutorial will show you how to compile your map to bsp format in QERadiant.<br><br>

<b>Step 1:</b><br><br>

If you have Kingpin installed to a custom directory or on a different hard drive letter:<br><br>


<b>Step 2:</b><br><br>

By this time, you should have a map with a light entity in it. If not build one now. Remember, if your map does not have any light entities or light brushes in it, all you will see is dark when it comes to play your map.<br><br>

Save your map to .../Kingpin/main/maps, the directory may not exist so you will have to make a new folder called 'maps' in your 'main' folder. Next save your map to the .../Kingpin/KPRad directory when it comes time to compile and test your map. It is important that both maps are the exact same thing. Now go to the 'bsp' menu and click 'bsp_FullVis'. A DOS window should pop up then everything should run okay, if you get any errors and the compile process stops, it means your project file settings is not correct.<br><br>

Although it may seem useless and a little time consuming to save your map to two different locations, it is required for it to work.<br><br>

<b>Step 3:</b><br><br>

When the compile process is done, close the window and QERadiant if you want then run Kingpin. Type in the console "map x" without quotation marks and x being the name of your map. If you do not have the console enabled, startup shortcut with "+set developer 1" without the quotation marks.<br><br>

<b>Step 4 (optional):</b><br><br>

Other BSP compile types:
If 'bsp_FullVis' takes too long or if you're map is huge, then try 'bsp_FastVis' or if you want to see your map with full brightness which takes only a second to compile then try 'bsp_only (novis/norad)'. When releasing a final map, use bsp_FullVis.<br><br></body></html>
