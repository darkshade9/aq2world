<b>Who is Adnan 'skew' Zafar</b>
<blockquote><div class="title">
Think waaay back in video game history. Back when a pixel was a white dot the size of your pinky fingernail on a television screen. Back when single-player modelling was either a pink dot holding an arrow (Adventure for Atari) or several lines of text (Zork)
<br><br>
A game called Combat (Tank Plus if you had a Sears TeleGames system) pitted 2 slow moving, blocky and somtimes confusingly shaped tanks against each other on a solid colored field with the ocassional impassable square. The object? In 90 seconds, shoot your opponent more than he shoots you. Deathmatch plain and simple.
<br><br>
Scroll forward 20 some-odd years to QuakeCon, August 11, 2001. You find the same basic game, <a href=http://combat.mindgrid.net><b>Combat</b></a>, released as a modification for Quake 3: Arena. All you have to do is speed it up several times and add some different weapons and give many arena choices and add a defacto CTF and . . . well you get the picture.
<br><br>
I tweaked Combat programmer Adnan "skew" Zafar for a few minutes on irc and talked to him about Combat now and future.

&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; ive been working on the vehicle damage for our next mod alot lately
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; the vehicles have hot swappable parts heh
<br>&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; next mod?
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; ya, another top down vehicle deal
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; the only hurdle in this is creating the dumbed down npc's
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; there will be a tank or two
<br><br>
&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; so how did the Combat release go? Tell me about release day.
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; oh god, it was hectic
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; the whole weekend actually
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; we had a problem with getting true random numbers that was hoolding back alot of our UI effects
<br>&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; iew
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; and we spent close to 4 hours on getting that finalized, then we just got down and did some ui tweakage
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; got that all working
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; went through all the maps again, recompiled them, play teseted each one, made sure there werew no errors
<br>&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; that was release w'end?
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; yeah, at qcon
<br>&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; oh gawd...
<br>&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; well how was reception at QCon?
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; well, we announced it a few times and got about 5 servers running in the byoc area at a time
<br>&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; among how many computers? 1000?
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; yeah
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; which was really cool because we had people coming up to where our computers were and just giving us compliments
<br>&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; yeah that is good.
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; each server had about 6 people on
<br>&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; that's a pretty good crowd.
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; so it was good
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; people LOVED ctf
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; were concentrating on the teamplay stuff as being the future of the mod
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; though we still have about 4 dm maps that are coming out, things we didnt have time to clean up for the qcon release
<br>&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; so you're looking that way for the future of Combat?
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; yeah, its just really... different
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; not too many people have played anything like that in q3 or any other fps
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; and they like it
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; so we figure why not
<br>&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; right 'why not'
<br>&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; so what's the avg brush count for a Combat map?
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; hmm
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; im guessing its around 250 - 300
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; for the more complex ones
<br>&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; yeah seems pretty low-count kinda stuff.
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; the terrain map is insane though
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; the terrain map is close to being the size of mpterra*
<br><br>
&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; You're releasing an SDK?
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; Yes. in it ive outlined the basics of how the camera works and how you can configure it to work per map, how to set up the arena dimensions so things dont feel cramped, what you should avoid (large heights of fog)
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; for the map stuff it also goes over how to set up the basic ctf entities
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; things like that
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; this is targetted towards people who havent done any mapping before
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; also, on the model side of things
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; it goes over how to create simple tank models, what you should do to include custom gibs, custom sounds, things like that
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; what you should look out for when creating models (bounding box, etc)
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; beyond that it goes over extra things like how to create new location markers, a new hud, stuff like that
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; its everything you need to create combat content, through and through
<br><br>
&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; so for game modes you have ctf and straight dm... have you had thoughts on expanding the mods available?
<br>&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; something like King of the Hill comes to mind.
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; yeah there are two new modes that i am working on adding
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; one of them is an overlord type of gameplay (like in team arena) where you have to breach the enemy base and destroy an object
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; im adding a few extras inthere like multiple buttons to hit before you can get to that object, letting the team whos base it is defend with a giant weapon, etc
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; im also doing a capture and hold gametype
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; where your team has t control certain points in a map and they get points while its held, etc
<br>&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; yeah... UT domination like
<br>&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; Do you have an ETA on these mods?
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; yeah, the modes will be in by the next release in a month BUT the content will not be ready by then
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; i'll release a new sdk at that point detailing how to create content for the extra modes
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; but the new content for that should be ready within 2 and a half months
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; if not 3, school does take up alot of our time
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; heh
<br>&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; yeah... darned real life!
<br><br>
&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; how many maps you think you'll have per mode with the new mods release?
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; oh i'd say 3 for each new mode
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; and more afterwards if we have time
<br>&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; And if Joe Bagodonuts wants to map for that stuff? Hows he get his work in?
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; the current sdk will tell him what to do, and the one to be updated for the new modes when they're ready
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; if joe is good he might even be able to join the team :)
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; were always looking for mappers to contribute
<br><br>
&lt;<b>Monsto</b>&gt; Not much feedback yet, i hear. only 3 emails eh?
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; getting feedback on this stuff (and providing it) should be easier as soon as we get the forums up
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; one from a guy working at a design studio who wants to develop content asap
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; one from a guy who said he loves ctf and thinks we should concentrate on that
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; and one from a the pc zone uk magazine heh
<br>&lt;<b>Adnan</b>&gt; no details yet, i am waiting for an e-mail back from the guy
