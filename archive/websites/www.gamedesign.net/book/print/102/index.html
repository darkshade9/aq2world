 This tutorial will demonstrate the procedures that need be taken to make a perfect a arch. Ok, now, you'll probably want to turn your arch around the proper way. You don't have to right now. It's just the way I've done it. The way it looks now would work, but it's not the way to go if you want perfection.
<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch2/q3Arch_PIC09.jpg"></div>
<br><br>
You'll notice from the picture that the shape of this isn't correct. The 
			ends and the very top are are not sized correctly with the grid. It 
			doesn't hit both sides of the major grid to make a 64 unit square. It's 
			more like 58 or 59. And in between that it is squeezed a little. This is
			what we're going to fix.
<br><br>
From here, we're going to drag the vertices to get the correct shape.
<br><br>
First you'll need to resize this to a descent grid size. I like to use 
			<font color="#FF6600">Grid16</font>, but you may use what ya like. You'll 
			want to resize it to the size you want it to be when finished. The only
			important thing here is that only the 
			<font color="#FF6600">outer edges</font> of this should be hitting the 
			major grid. This makes it easier on you to get it to where it needs to be 
			with the way I do this. You'll find out later on what I mean by this as 
			you make more of these. Also, I don't know if this is the way the guys at 
			ID Software does their arches, it's just the way I found to do it to look 
			correct.

			Ok, from here, you'll need to make an <font color="#FF6600">End cap</font>. 
			I use the End cap because it the correct shape already and does not need
			to be reshaped. It is the standard shape of all the curves in Quake III 
			Arena.
<br><br>
First draw another brush, any size, and go to the 
			<font color="#FF6600">Curve</font> menu and select
			<font color="#FF6600">End cap</font>. Now turn it and position it by your 
			arch to look like the picture.
<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch2/q3Arch_PIC10.jpg"></div>
<br><br>
From this you can see where the 
			imperfections are. Make CERTAIN that the End cap is positioned correctly 
			on the major grid lines, as shown. After you've done that, unselect the 
			<font color="#FF6600">End cap</font> and select the arch. you may have to 
			move these around a little so you can select each one when you like. By 
			that, I mean, the <font color="Yellow">End cap</font> should be in front 
			of the arch.
<br><br>
After you have everything in position and the arch selected, go to the 
			<font color="#FF6600">Selection</font> menu and select 
			<font color="#FF6600">Drag/Drag Vertices</font>.
<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch2/q3Arch_PIC11.jpg"></div>
<br><br>
Here you should see the <font color="#FF6600">Vertices</font> around the 
			arch. These are what we move to reposition the arch so it is the correct 
			shape. Now, this can get a little tricky too. First, save your work. You 
			don't have to unselect anything to so.
<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch2/q3Arch_PIC12.jpg"></div>
<br><br>
First you'll need to set your grid again to <font color="#FF6600">Grid1</font> 
			and zoom in to see the grid lines. Now, go to the bottom left end of the arch 
			and position your mouse over the right <font color="#FF6600">Vertice</font>.
<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch2/q3Arch_PIC13.jpg"></div>
<br><br>
Now press and hold the left button and drag the corner right 
			<font color="#FF6600">Vertice</font> to the right so that the corners of 
			both the arch and the <font color="#FF6600">End cap</font> are perfectly 
			in line.
<br><br>
One thing you'll have to be careful about is if you click on a 
			<font color="#FF6600">Vertice</font> and let off and go right back to it 
			and drag it again, you'll notice that there are more 
			<font color="#FF6600">Vertices</font> under the one and/or ones you moved. 
			This can get aggravating. Not to worry though. Just hit escape and move 
			the <font color="#FF6600">Vertice</font> back to where ya started.
<br><br>
There are 5 <font color="#FF6600">Vertices</font> that need to be moved 
			for the bottom. Then 5 for the top and 5 for the middle. There are 15 
			<font color="#FF6600">Vertices</font> all together that need to be 
			moved.
<br><br>
Ok, now go onto the middle bottom <font color="#FF6600">Vertice</font>.
<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch2/q3Arch_PIC14.jpg"></div>
<br><br>
Now align that to the very top of the 
			<font color="#FF6600">End cap</font>. Now go on to the right end of the 
			arch.
<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch2/q3Arch_PIC15.jpg"></div>
<br><br>
Align this one up with the corners. Now just move up to the 
			<font color="#FF6600">Vertice</font> between the right end and the middle 
			one.
<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch2/q3Arch_PIC16.jpg"></div>
<br><br>
This one is a little tricky. The <font color="#FF6600">Vertice</font> 
			isn't at the corner or where the lines meet but up into the arch a 
			little. You can see it in the picture. Just move it down and to the left
			and align the line of both the Arch and the 
			<font color="#FF6600">End cap</font>. Now one more at the other end.
<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch2/q3Arch_PIC17.jpg"></div>
<br><br>
Same as the last. Line it up the same way. Now zoom out and the next picture is what it should look like all lined up.
<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch2/q3Arch_PIC18.jpg"></div>
<br><br>
This is the way it looks with the correct shape at the bottom.
<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch2/q3Arch_PIC19.jpg" width="450"></div>
<br><br>
Now save your work and we'll move onto the top <font color="#FF6600">Vertices</font>.<br>
