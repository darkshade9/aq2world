To create words on the walls seeing throughout Doom 3, you need to use patches and alphabet texture. Make a 16 by 16 unit brush and click on the <b>Patch->Simple Patch Mesh...</b> Then apply the alphabet texture, which is located in the decals texture folder, on the patch.

You probably won't have it aligned right, so naturalize the texture by opening the Surface Inspector and clicking <b>Natural</b> button under the Texturing area.<br><br>

<i>Note: You can press Ctrl+N to naturalize the texture.</i>

Change the grid to <b>0.25</b> by pressing <b>Shift+3</b>. Then move the patch close to the wall so the gap between the wall and the patch will be one unit thick.

Open Surface Inspector and change <b>Shift horizontally</b> and <b>Shift vertically</b> values to <b>0.005</b>. The values are low, but they center the letters perfectly. Move the arrows up or down to find the letter you need. If the letter seems upside down, use <b>Flip X</b> or <b>Flip Y</b> under the Texturing area, to flip it.

After you created the letter you wanted, copy it by pressing Space and move it next to the first letter. Use Surface Inspector to create second letter, third, etc.<br><br>

<i>Note: To scale the letters you can change the size of the patch. It should automaticlly scale on resize.</i><br><br>

For this tutorial I created a news board.
