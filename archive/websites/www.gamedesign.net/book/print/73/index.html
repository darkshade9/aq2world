<b>Rust: </b>Both Prax War and OpFor are military based.  Will we be able to see any influence of Prax War (based on screenshots, etc) in Opposing Force?  Were any ideas planned for Prax War implemented in OpFor instead?
<br><br>
<b>Rob: </b>Anyone with a sharp eye will probably be able to see similarities in style between the two games, mostly in the models and some level design.  However, everythingin the design for OpFor has been drawn up from scratch to keep in line with the Half-Life universe
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What challenges has the Half-Life technology presented in the development of OpFor? Is there anything that you found that just wasn't possible at this point in time?
<br><br>
<b>Rob: </b>I think the most challenging aspect so far has been designing around the base system requirements.  One of our main goals is to let everyone who played the original game have the same experience without having to upgrade their machine.  There are some very cool things we'd like to implement, but due to certain constraints with the engine (e.g. the software renderer), they just aren't feasible.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Friendly scientists were a large part of Half-Life, and friendly soldier's seem to play the same part in OpFor.  What kind of control will you have over the soldiers in-game (as opposed to the simple use/un-use for scientists)?  Also, what kind of control will the mapper have over soldiers and can the soldiers be made un-friendly?
<br><br>
<b>Rob: </b>The control for the friendly soldiers will be the same as for previous friendly characters (i.e. simple use/unuse commands).  We're not trying to turn Half-Life into a squad-based combat/strategy game, so we chose to stick with the original interface.  However, being that they are soldiers, they will have a broader range of behavior and skills, so they will inherently do more with you without the need for a more complicated interface.  
<br><br>
From an editing standpoint, the friendly soldiers will be a new entity class that works just like the other friendly characters.  To make soldiers who are enemies to the character, you can simply use the original soldier entities, whose behavior will remain unmodified.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What kind of new entities will be introduced in OpFor, aside from the new weapons and monsters?
<br><br>
<b>Rob: </b>Surprisingly very few new entities are needing to be created.  Most of what we need to make the pack is already implemented, although there may be a few new env_ or special class ents for new effects.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Has the vehicle system been modified in any way (for example, to allow for a vehicle with a dynamic path)?
<br><br>
<b>Rob: </b>As of right now, we have no plans to make any modifications to the vehicle system.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Have any other previous Half-Life entities been modified or enhanced?
<br><br>
<b>Rob: </b>All of the original Half-Life entities will remain untouched.  This will allow anyone currently doing Half-Life editing to easily implement any maps/models/mods into the OpFor game set if they want to.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Will the editing support for OpFor be on the CD?  Will it be released before OpFor is out (so other editors could implement OpFor support, etc)?
<br><br>
<b>Rob: </b>The only editing support that should be necessary will be an updated .fgd for Worldcraft.  We'll probably release the game source and the .fgd shortly after the game hits store shelves.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Which game engine have you had the most fun mapping for?
<br><br>
<b>Rob: </b>Definitely the Half-Life engine.  Valve did a great job in creating a solid system with a high level of flexibility and control.</body></html>
