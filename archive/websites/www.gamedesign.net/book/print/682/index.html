<div class="q3bg1">As you frag your way through opponent after opponent, you may hear the occasional "excellent" or "impressive" echoing around you. These accolades are accompanied by medals - symbols that will appear over your head to show off your mad skillz to everyone on the map. Your earned medals are displayed at the end of the game and tallied up. Here's a guide to the different medals you can earn.<br><br>

<h3>Accuracy:</h3>
<p class="q3bg2"><img src="/images/hit-ratio.jpg" class="imglb"><img src="/images/quake-III-media/medals/medal_accuracy.jpg" class="imgrb">Kind of like a sharp shooter medal, this is awarded when your percentage of hits-to-shots is more than 50%.</p>

<h3>Excellent:</h3>
<p class="q3bg2"><img src="/images/quake-III-media/medals/medal_excellent.jpg" class="imgrb">If you make two frags within two seconds, you'll receive this medal and a resounding "excellent" by the announcer. It's very gratifying and helps to prod you to furthur prowess by racing your ass off trying to find smeone else to frag!</p>

<h3>Frags:</h3>
<p class="q3bg2"><img src="/images/quake-III-media/medals/medal_frags.jpg" class="imgrb">You'll see the special frags medal if you're talented enough to get to a frag count of 100. This usually only happens when you're surrounded by a mix of good players and noob fodder between you and your major competition you tend to rack up the frags.</p>

<h3>Gauntlet:</h3>
<p class="q3bg2"><img src="/images/quake-III-media/medals/medal_gauntlet.jpg" class="imgrb">Since it's difficult to actually frag someone with the gauntlet, you'll receive this medal if you humiliate someone by doing just that. The gauntlet's useful for defensive corners and windows/doors. When in q3ctf1, one finds themselves racking a few guantlet frags each round.</p>

<h3>Impressive:</h3>
<p class="q3bg2"><img src="/images/quake-III-media/medals/medal_impressive.jpg" class="imgrb">Everyone knows that the railgun requires the most skill. That's why this medal is awarded for making two consecutive hits with it. Anyone punchin out multiple hits with the rail while surruonded by good competition is worthy of reward.</p>

<h3>Perfect:</h3>
<p class="q3bg2"><img src="/images/quake-III-media/medals/medal_victory.jpg" class="imgrb">You'll receive this medal if you've managed the almost-impossible task of winning an arena without getting killed once yourself. Best of luck, you need it. Whetther online or off, you've got to be talented to be getting one of these medals.</p></div></ul><h1 id="858" name="858" class="book-h1">Configuring the q3config.cfg</h1><ul><h3>Configuring the Q3CONFIG.CFG</h3>
<p class="q3bg3">There is no better place on the web for you to learn about the q3config file than at <a href="http://www.maxxblade.co.uk" target="blank">Maxx Blade's Javascripts</a>. The <a href="http://www.maxxblade.co.uk/q3config/index.htm" target="blank">Q3A Config V1.2</a> is a tool that allows you to paste your config into it and then customize it completely across ten categorical and desciptive option pages.</p>
<p class="q3bg1">NOTE - As things progress this page will grow so check back here for updates.</p>
<h3>Binding a screenshotjpeg</h3>
<p class="q3bg3">Make a copy of the q3config.cfg and rename it q3config.cfgbk. Open up the q3config.cfg using wordpad(notepad delimits line breaks differently), scroll down until you find the area between keys where the one you wish to bind fits alphabetically. Ensure that it is not already bound. Bind the key (the = ) by pasting the following in.</p>
<blockquote>bind = "cg_drawcrosshair 0;cg_drawstatus 0;cg_drawTimer 0;wait;wait;wait;wait;wait;screenshotjpeg;wait;cg_drawcrosshair 4;cg_drawstatus 1;cg_drawtimer 1"</blockquote>
<p class="q3bg3">This turns off the various items related to HUD then waits to ensure they've shut off. Then takes a jpeg format screenshot, waits to ensure it's been taken, then turns everything back on again. All by pressing the equal sign key, or f12 or whatever you bind yours to.</p></ul><h1 id="861" name="861" class="book-h1">Console</h1><ul><h3>Quake III Console</h3>

  - bot: Crash<br>
  The introduction bot to the arena ethernal. A low-opponent , good to train an

<blockquote><img src="images/quake-III-media/characters/tier1/tier1_groupshot_medium.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><small><b>q3dm1</b> - Arena Gate<br>
- bot: Ranger<br>
Reactive. That's wrack: no more no less. The first real bot you encounter and at nightmare level he's one of the fastest and precisest of the whole game. Incredible as he hits you with the first rocket, making you fly over the arena, and as he explodes you on the fly with the second (rocket of course...).<br>
<b>q3dm2</b> - House of Pain<br>
- bot: Phobos<br>
The Second bot of the tier 1: Surprisingly, Phobos got good tactic skills and also good aiming skills so beware, especially when he get the haste.<br>
<b>q3dm3</b> - Arena of Death<br>
- bots: Mynx, Orbb<br>
Mynx is the superfashion model that get lots of kickass in the second map of the tier 2. Absolutely deadly with the shotgun (hits ever onto face) but lack of tatics and skill with other weapons.  Orbb, another strong and unusual bot. Hard to beat, ever jumping and all-weapon-ranged bot, Orbb can easily became your nightmare : i never win against him at nightmare level in his own map...<br>
<b>q3tourney1</b> - Powerstation 0218<br>
- bot: Sarge<br>
The hero starring in the Id intro of the game. A medium bot with a predilection for the rocket launcher, and cuban cigars...</small></blockquote><br>

<b>q3tourney3</b> - Hell's Gate<br>

<p class="q3bg3">The following is information about the various tier maps included with Quake III Arena. This area is difided into a section for each tier.</p></ul><h1 id="804" name="804" class="book-h3">Tier 0 - Introduction</h1><ul><h3>Tier 0</h3>
<p class="q3bg1"><img src="/images/quake-III-media/maps/q3dm0.jpg" hspace="10" align="left"><b>q3dm0 - Introduction</b>: A training level, containing a small room with a portal, connecting to a slightly larger area with a plasma gun on one end and a shotgun behind doors in a central area. This map is very small and not designed for anything but training.</p>
<p class="q3bg2"><b>Opponents</b>: Crash</p>
<p class="q3bg2"><b>Armor</b>: Armor Shards, Yellow Armor</p>
<p class="q3bg2"><b>Health</b>: SH, MH, LH</p>

<p class="q3bg1"><img src="/images/quake-III-media/maps/q3dm1.jpg" hspace="10" align="left"><b>q3dm1 - Arena Gate</b>: One of the maps in the official Quake III demo, this is the first map in the single-player ladder. At one end is a small courtyard with a RL in the center; at the other, an indoor area with a PG and red armor. There's a health placed at a key entrance to the courtyard -- players have to go through this area to get outside, so keep an eye on this junction from the RL and you should easily be able to control the level in a one-on-one match. </p>
<p class="q3bg2"><b>Opponents</b>: Ranger</p>
<p class="q3bg2"><b>Armor</b>: Armor Shards, Red Armor</p>
<p class="q3bg2"><b>Health</b>: SH, LH</p>
<p class="q3bg2"><b>Weapons</b>: SG, MG, RL, PG</p>
<p class="q3bg2"><b>Powerups</b>: None</p>
<p class="q3bg1"><img src="/images/quake-III-media/maps/q3dm2.jpg" hspace="10" align="left"><b>q3dm2 - House of Pain</b>: This map is basically a loop, with a watery lower alley running through the middle. There's a main outside area with a PG, and a room through the left archway with a RL. The right archway leads to a haste powerup that regenerates at long intervals, and a red armor can be found directly below it in the water. 
Most players tend to congregate by the RL and the PG, so arming yourself quickly and keeping an eye on these areas (without standing in the middle of either) will help get your frag count up.</p>
<p class="q3bg2"><b>Opponents</b>: Phobos</p>
<p class="q3bg2"><b>Armor</b>: Armor Shards, Yellow Armor, Red Armor</p>
<p class="q3bg2"><b>Health</b>: SH, LH</p>
<p class="q3bg2"><b>Weapons</b>: SG, MG, RL, PG</p>
<p class="q3bg2"><b>Powerups</b>: Haste</p>
<p class="q3bg1"><img src="/images/quake-III-media/maps/q3dm3.jpg" hspace="10" align="left"><b>q3dm3 - Arena of Death</b>: This map is also a simple loop, with one path running around the full perimeter, and a second path running three three quarters of the way around the lower perimeter. One corner of the map features a rocket laucnher and PG spawning alternatively at the top of short staircase, while a grenade laucnher can be found in the opposite darkened corner. There is also a two-level central area, with a red armor on the upper level. 

As you might expect, players tend to gather around the RL and PG, making this an extremely dangerous area to be running around in. In a free-for-all with more than three or four players, the best bet is to clear the area out with the GL before heading in. You'll need to get past this area in order to get the red armor, so once on the upper level, try and control it for as long as possible.</p>
<p class="q3bg2"><b>Opponents</b>: Mynx, Orbb</p>
<p class="q3bg2"><b>Armor</b>: Armor Shards, Red Armor</p>

<p class="q3bg1"><img src="/images/quake-III-media/maps/q3tourney1.jpg" hspace="10" align="left"><b>q3tourney1 - Power Station 0218</b>: An extremely simple futuristic-themed map, this 1-on-1 arena is laid out as four rooms in a loop, with a fifth room connected at the end. This last room is basically a dead end, but contains the only RL in the level. Quad damage and regenerations powerups also spawn alternatively, so without any other key weapons to speak of, these are the two areas you'll want to control.</p>
<p class="q3bg2"><b>Opponents</b>: Sarge</p>
<p class="q3bg2"><b>Armor</b>: Yellow Armor</p>

<p class="q3bg1"><img src="/images/quake-III-media/maps/q3dm4.jpg" hspace="10" align="left">q3dm4 - Place of Many Deaths: The main level of this indoor map consists of three main rows and columns of hallways connected in a symmetrical pattern. Two staircases lead to a rocket launcher, which overlooks the quad damage respawns point below. The other end of the map features a plasma gun next to a portal, which will teleport you back to the center of the map; directly below this point is a red armor at the very bottom of the map.<br><br>The general strategy here -- stay high. Staying on the main level in a crowded game is a crapshoot; while the rocket launcher platform is easily defended and overlooks the quad damage point. Even if someone grabs the quad before you, it should not be hard to frag him with a few rockets before he gets away.</p>
<p class="q3bg2">Opponents: Orbb, Bitterman, Grunt <br>Armor: Heavy Armor Health: Yellow Health, Gold Health <br>Weapons: Shotgun, Machine Gun, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Gun<br>Powerups: Quad Damage</p>
<p class="q3bg1"><img src="/images/quake-III-media/maps/q3dm5.jpg" hspace="10" align="left">q3dm5 - The Forgotten Place: This castle-themed level consists of five main areas - two rooms at each end connected by a larger central area. It appears simple enough, but the many paths connecting the rooms and vertical architecture can confuse you in a hurry. A rocket launcher can be found in a cubby near the center of the level, and a plasma gun and shotgun at each far end. A red armor can also be found on a walkway above the central area.<br><br>The rocket launcher is a strong choice for this level -- the hallway directly above it narrows so you can drop down and grab it when no one's looking. If you're really daring (and have enough armor), you can also rocket jump out in case anyone is camping that area, which happens often in crowded games. Whatever you do, steer clear of the shotgun end of the map -- there's nothing of any real use there and you'll only end up wasting time while other players grab the more powerful weapons.</p>
<p class="q3bg2">Opponents: Hossman, Daemia<br>Armor: Armor Shards, Combat Armor, Heavy Armor<br>Health: Yellow Health, Gold Health<br>Weapons: Shotgun, Machine Gun, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Gun<br>Powerups: None</p>
<p class="q3bg1"><img src="/images/quake-III-media/maps/q3dm6.jpg" hspace="10" align="left">q3dm6 - The Camping Grounds: One of the most popular Q3 maps, The Camping Grounds is a large level with an assortment of jump pads and extremely high architecture. There are two key areas you'll want to control: a central area with the quad damage at the bottom, and the rocket launcher up high (accessible via jump pad). The second key area is a set of towers which contain a variety of powerups, including the megahealth, ammo, a transporter, and finally a red armor.<br><br>The real key to this level is learning your way around. Health is scattered throughout the level, so even when hurt, a skilled player can usually lose an attacker long enough to heal up. Many players tend to go for the rocket launcher and then head to the right for the red armor. Be careful when going for either -- players tend to camp both jump pads, and you're a sitting duck when you get to the top.</p>

<p class="q3bg1"><img src="/images/quake-III-media/maps/q3tourney2.jpg" hspace="10" align="left">q3tourney2 - The Proving Grounds: One of the maps included in the Q3demo, The Proving Grounds consists of two main areas. The first is a large room split into upper and lower levels, with a rocket launcher below and yellow armor above, connected by jump pads. The second area is much smaller, containing a lightning gun, a yellow armor, and a very treacherous walkway over a fiery bottomless pit. The two areas are all connected by a series of walkways, and also via teleporter, so it's extremely easy to get to any point on the map in a hurry.<br><br>In a 1-on-1 match, the key is to control the armor. You can basically hear where your opponent is at any time by listening for the teleporter, jump pads and armor sounds; with so many entrances to each area, it's nearly impossible to hide. Unless you're extremely skilled with the lightning gun, you'll find it extremely hard to frag a fully-armored opponent. In a free-for-all, you're on your own -- if you're good, you can rip thorugh plenty of players with the lightning gun. Steer clear of the rocket launcher pit -- there's usually too much happening there to stay alive for long.</p>
<p class="q3bg2">Opponents: Hunter<br>Armor: Armor Shards, Combat Armor<br>Health: Yellow Health, Gold Health<br>Weapons: Shotgun, Machine Gun, Rocket Launcher, Lightning Gun<br>Powerups: None</p></ul><h1 id="807" name="807" class="book-h3">Tier 3</h1><ul><h3>Tier 3 Maps</h3>
<p class="q3bg1"><img src="/images/quake-III-media/maps/q3dm7.jpg" hspace="10" align="left">q3dm7 - Temple of Retribution: The first map in the original Q3test, Temple of Retribution is a decent-sized map that features a few key areas. There are five rooms connected in a chain -- two outdoors on each end -- and two more rooms on sublevels below. Many of the main rooms also have side connections to each other, so it's pretty easy to get from one place to another as long as you don't drop below.<br><br>The largest room contains a railgun on small walkway platform, and a quad damage. If you drop down, you'll find a yellow armor, a megahealth and a teleporter that will send you to the plasma gun room. The other two key points of the level each contain rocket launchers -- one of them is outside and is connected to almost every other room on the map, the other contains a teleporter and a button that opens a doorway to a lower room with the red armor.<br><br>Once again, armor is a key to doing well on this level. With so much of an emphasis on the rocket launcher, armor will allow you to outlast your opponents more times than not. Players tend to give away where they're heading a lot on this map; try and keep yourself in open areas (lots of rockets cause plenty of splash damage when you're up against a wall) and you'll be able to rack up quite a few frags. If you can manage to get a plasma gun and quad damage at the same time, you can rip off a massive amount of frags in a short period of time.</p>

<p class="q3bg1"><img src="/images/quake-III-media/maps/q3dm8.jpg" hspace="10" align="left">q3dm8 - Brimstone Abbey: There are three main areas to this level, connected by a series of jump pads and hallways: at one end, a small outdoor pool containing red armor; in the center, a large cathedral-like room with a plasma gun, and a bounce pad leading to a quad/invisibilty platform; at the other end, an upper area containing a rocket launcher accessible by jump pads.<br><br>One thing you want to avoid in this level is the water. The railgun sits on a platform directly above, and you'll be a sitting duck for any campers in the area. the rocket launcher area is relatively easy to get to, and you should constantly be listening to hear if anyone has grabbed the invisibilty rune, which can be quite nasty if you're unaware anyone has it. Try and grab as much armor as you can, and never assume you're alone...unless you're invisible.</p>
<p class="q3bg2">Opponents: Gorre, Bitterman, Angel, Slash<br>Armor: Armor Shards, Combat Armor, Heavy Armor<br>Health: Green Health, Yellow Health, Gold Health<br>Weapons: Shotgun, Machine Gun, Grenade Launcher, Rocket Launcher, Rail Gun, Plasma Gun<br>Powerups: Mega Health, Quad Damage, Invisibility</p>
<p class="q3bg1"><img src="/images/quake-III-media/maps/q3dm9.jpg" hspace="10" align="left">q3dm9 - Hero's Keep: Another popular Q3 map, Hero's Keep is a jump pad-filled level which you'll want to be careful to keep your balance on -- it's not uncommon to join a server and find the majority of players with negative scores. The main reason: at each end of the level are key areas only accessible via jump pad.<br><br>At one end of the level is a rocket launcher platform way, out on it's own. Leaving the platform on a crowded server can be tricky -- players heading to and from the platform often smack together in midair, causing both to drop to their death. Above this area is a megahealth, which can be reached via a treacherous jump pad hard to use in the heat of battle. Surrounding this area are two hallways containing armor and plasma guns. <br><br>At the other end of the level is a second large room with a railgun platform area at the far end. The ledge can be reached directly by jump pad, or indirectly by another jump pad located at the entrance to the area -- drop down into the hole and you'll be bounced, Sonic-the-Hedgehog-style, up to a platform in front of the railgun with a red armor.<br><br>Because of the acceleration pads, it's hard to use the railgun in many places on this map. Your best bet is to use the rocket launcher and plasma guns, and try to keep on solid ground as much as possible. It's easy to get caught up in all the jump pads and lose 5 or 6 frags per game, which can often mean the difference between winning and losing.</p>

This glowing blue cylinder of light will replenish both your health and armor at approximately 10 points per second as long as you stand there. Unfortunately, this makes you a sitting duck, especially when considering the rocket launcher sits in direct view of this area.<br><br>The map has a variety of staircases leading to an upper level, with a red armor to the left, and a lightning gun to the right. The very back contains a powerup spawning point, which will at different times produce the quad damage, regeneration and invisibility powerups.<br><br>The regeneration chamber/rocket launcher area tends to be one of the most crowded spots on the map, so try to keep an eye on it without becoming a target yourself.

If you grab the quad, alarms will go off and turrets on the wall will begin to flood both the quad and haste rooms with grenades. Your best bet is to get out of the room as quickly as possible after grabbing the quad.<br><br>The rocket launcher room is a key one on this map, as it also contains the red armor, is next to the medkit, and is located near the portal to the quad damage room.

No longer a slow-charging device, this BFG shoots out huge -- and fast-moving -- blobs of energy that can rip just about anyone to shreds in a hurry. The BFG is located in an underwater room directly over the regeneration powerup respawn point. You can also portal into the room from a teleporter located on the perimeter of the map, and a second teleporter inside the BFG room will send you to a yellow armor ledge high above the central area.<br><br>The key to this map is to control the central area -- players generally congregate by the rocket launcher -- and there's no better way to do this than with the BFG. Never use the water if you can help it; learn how to teleport to the BFG room, and then out to the central area, and you should be able to pick players off rather easily.

A good strategy is to get the plasma gun or rocket launcher and make the downstairs turf your own, where you'll get much clearer shots at enemies. You can also defend the railgun platform, which is hard to hit with the rocket launcher, but it's usually not long before players come charging up the ramp after you.

machine gun takes bullets (pictured left). One advantage to the machine gun is that its bullets travel (essentially) instantaneously; they do not have 
to travel to the target at some definite speed like, say, the plasma gun. <br><br>However, the machine gun has built-in inaccuracy: Even when holding perfectly still, your hits will end up within a small circle around your crosshair. At extreme range, the machine gun is not very useful because of this; even if your target is holding perfectly still and your aim is dead on, many of your shots will miss. The machine gun has a high rate of fire, but each bullet does not do much damage. <br><br>The machine gun is best use for close quarters combat, when you have no other more appropriate weapons handy. Use the machine gun at short to medium range only when you have no more appropriate weapons available to you. If your machine gun is outmatched by your opponent's weapon, retreat.</blockquote>

Like the machine gun, the shotgun's fire travels instantaneously. The spread of the blast is quite significant, so at extreme range the blast will cover a wide area, but since it fires many bullets at once one or two are likely to hit their mark, causing minor damage. At close range the shotgun can be devastating, since the spread is low enough that in close quarters combat most of the bullets will hit their target. <br><br>Its disadvantage is that it requires a fair amount of time to reload, so although you can deal out some serious damage, your opponent with a weapon that can cycle more quickly may have the upper hand. <br><br>Use the shotgun at close range for extreme damage. At medium range it is somewhat more effective than a machine gun at inflicting incremental damage.</blockquote>

The plasma bolts have a small area effect, or "splash," which allows them to cause damage not only to what they hit but to what is near them. This unfortunately means, as with other splash weapons, you can injure yourself with the plasma gun if you, say, fire it into a wall that you're standing against. <br><br>The plasma is an all-around good weapon for short through long ranges.

The lightning gun can be effective in some situations; some prefer it to, say, the plasma gun. If you have a low ping, consider it as an alternative.</blockquote>

When totally outgunned, firing grenades can make the battlefield a death trap, even after your opponent has fragged you; it's cheap, but effective. Use grenades for suppressive fire, covering your line of retreat, or laying-in-wait ambushes. <br><br>Don't bother using the grenade launcher as an actual weapon in a combat situation, unless you have no other good alternatives available.</blockquote>

Rockets (pictured left) have a fairly large splash effect and do severe damage when landing a direct hit. <br><br>At close to long ranges, rockets are most effective; at extreme ranges they do not travel fast enough to pose a threat, except when used as suppressive fire. As with other weapons, rockets impart momentum to their target, so not only can hitting an enemy with a rocket or rocket splash knock him backwards, but can use it on oneself by firing at the ground and simultaneously jumping to jump extra high, or "rocketjump." The rocket launcher will be the preeminent weapon in your arsenal; use it with pride.</blockquote>

Two hits with a railgun to an unarmored opponent are lethal. The zoom key can be quite useful here for a target at extreme range. The railgun emits a quiet hum while held, as if begging for victims. People proficient with the railgun are usually referred to as "railers," which is a compliment among railers and an insult among their victims. <br><br>The railgun is a devastating weapon in the hands of a skilled player.
