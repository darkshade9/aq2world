<u><b>Changes/Additions: </b></u><br>
<blockquote>
  <p>- Ricochet included in this release.<br>
   - Added logging of the anti-cheat system catching and kicking detected cheats. <br>
   - Added logging of "kick" commands. <br>
   - Added logging of "banid" commands. <br>
   - Changed error message if clients try to download missing resources to be more helpful. <br>
   - Changed 'exec' command now only works on .cfg and .rc files. <br>
   - Changed 'exec' command no longer allows ".." or "\\" or ":" in the filename. <br>
   - Added new debug message for mod makers if a packet couldn't be parsed correctly. 
   - Linux: hlds_run now does auto-restart by default (to disable: define "-norestart" on the command line) <br>
   - Linux: hlds_run uses "exec" when you define the "-norestart" option. <br>
   - Linux: Added -pingboost command line parameter. Currently supports three different methods ('-pingboost 1', '-pingboost 2', and 'pingboost 3'). These may not work well (or at all) on some OS environments. <br>
