<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Half-Life Level Design</span><br />
The game is about six years old (at the time of writing this..Feb 05) and there are more capable engines around to achieve a great 3D FPS adventure, so why bother with Half-life?<br />
That is a question you will have to answer, but I can assure you that with a little work, the results can be worth it.<br />
Half-Life first shipped with a copy of the level editor WorldCraft. This was enhanced over the years and the name changed to Hammer with the last release being a beta version 3.5 (which has never been finalised).<br />
Hammer and Qeradient are two popular level editors available. Both were equally supported by a community of dedicated designers, so the choice is up to you.<br />
</p>
<p>
Due to the age of the engine and the number of editors that support it, it would be pointless (difficult) to list every know issue that surrounds level design in Half-Life. What we will attemp to do is give a general overview of some of the options available and links to sites that will provide the answers.<br />
</p>
<p>
One of the best links for all HL related programs is:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.slackiller.com/hlprograms.htm">Slackiller.com</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>
Almost everything you need to design and create your own levels can be found there.
</p>
<p>
Once you have your editor of choice, follow the setup instructions. <br />
<span style="font-style: italic">&quot;The majority of problems encountered are directly related to incorrect editor setup.&quot;</span>
</p>
<p>
If you do have difficulties, then the best site for answers is:
