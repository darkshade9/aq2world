<h3>LOCALTEAM</h3>
<b>
Localteam used to group AI in gangs. Like gang, Sewer Rats<br>
in Skidrow. They're your enemies, but sometimes they warn<br>
you like "What the f*ck you lookin' at?". If you kill<br>
gang member they start blasting you without saying anything.<br><br>
</b>
Example use: select all characters, which you want to be<br>
in the gang and open Entity inspector.<br><br>
<font color = "red">
Key	localteam<br>
Value	sewer_rats<br><br>
</font>
Value is the name of the gang. You can change it on whatever
you want.</body></html>
