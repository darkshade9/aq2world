by Method<br><br>

<b>IDEA</b><br>
Before you start your level you must have an idea of what you trying to make. It's possible to start putting some brushes together and get the idea, but good maps always have an idea. Think of areas or details you might include.<br><br>

<b>SKETCH</b><br>
It's also a good practice to sketch your levels. I can't say that all pro's sketch, but some do, I'm not a pro but, I found that sketching a level helps you speed up the development time and see if everything looks like you wanted. Try including little notes on the sides, so in the future you won't forget them.<br><br>

<b>RESEARCH</b><br>
Sometimes it's good to make a little research on items and architecture of particular time. You can get ideas from movies, pictures, books, etc. Also try searching the net for an images of what you're building.<br><br>

<b>MAPPING</b><br>
Begin follow the design you made on your sketch in editor. Many times you'll find that your level will look diffirent than sketch. Don't add details yet, try building the basic architecture, whitout entities, just brush work. Compile the map with fullbright light and run through the level to see how it plays.<br><br>

<b>ENTITIES</b><br>
Now add all the entities, except lights. Place everything where you planned and compile your map with fullbright light again, cause if you compile it fully it'll take some time to vis/rad. But what if your func_train stuck somewhere or followed wrong path_corner and you have to recompile your map again? That's why you compile fullbright - bsp_only (novis/norad), so it'll compile fast and you don't have to wait a lot.<br><br>

<b>LIGHT</b><br>
After looking at your map in fullbright color, you might think that it's not what you wanted. But after you add the light it'll look a lot better. Light is one of the most important parts in level design, it can make or brake your level. So take your time perfecting the light, even pro's work on the light for a few weeks. Try adding dynamic and spot lights, but don't add it just so your map will look better, cause in some cases adding many kinds of lights will brake your level.<br><br>

<b>R_SPEEDS</b><br>
R_speeds are important too, especially if you making a DeathMatch level. What if you made a good map, a bunch of details, but it runs slow? People won't play it, cause it'll be slow and they might get killed. So try keeping your r_speeds lower than 900 for SinglePlayer level and 800 for DeathMatch. In some games you can check r_speeds by typing in console "r_speeds 1" to enable and "r_speeds 0" to disable. You can reduce r_speeds by making small brushes detailed and brushes which touch any surface func_wall.<br><br>

<b>DETAILS</b><br>
Details are what seperates good level designer from others. Try adding some nice details, but don't add a bunch of them, cause it will slow down your map. If you have a street which leads to other area/building add a store to it, with tables, chairs, bottles, pipes, etc. Don't just build linear gameplay, add some places where player can visit for health or weapons. Research some good ideas of details you can add to your map.<br><br>

<b>CLIP BRUSH</b><br>
Clip brush is a brush with clip texture on it and it's not drawn in game. There're two kinds of clip brushes, clip and monsterclip. Clip brush stops player and monsterclip stops characters/monsters. So run in your map, find places where you get stuck and place clip brushes there.<br><br>

<b>BETA TESTING</b><br>
It's always good if you give your map to a couple of friends, so they can beta test it, see if everything runs good. Listen to what they have to say, sometimes you can miss something in your map, but they might find it.<br><br>
