<p><b>RUST:</b> You are probably one of the most well known Mapper's here on RUST and on the Gamedesign.Net forums. Your work has been widely excepted by the Mapping Community as great mapping, recieving some great reviews. How did you come into mapping, what inspired you download an map editor?</p>

<p><font color=red><b>RD:</b> I forget how I began mapping becuz that was very very long ago and I have a bad memory. I think it was becuz of the movie scarface</font></p> 

<p><b>RUST:</b> Your work covers many different styles and games, and have produced many different levels including: <a href="http://www.pitrd.com/pit/website/maps/maps.html">fy_iceworld, cs_korean_spyship, cs_horsewhisperer, r6_arena, fy_neighbours, de_omg, ex_iban, de_torabora, de_tuberaider, fy_rambohulk, fy_satanchrist.</a> Where do you get the ideas for your levels? And how do you stay motivated to finish what you start? Most people can’t finish one level let alone 11!</p> 

<p><font color=red><b>RD:</b> I get ideas from current events , like wars, or movies that were released. Somtimes from other games.</font></p> 

<p align = "center"><Img  border="0" width="250" src = "http://www.pitrd.com/pit/website/maps/screenshots/tora/tora4.JPG"></br>EX_IBAN</p>

<p><b>RUST:</b> The presentation of your work is exceptional, I’m impressed by you texture choices, placement and lighting. Do you see the level in your head before you start, or do you agonize over every addition to the level?</p> 

<p><font color=red><b>RD:</b> I agonize</font></p> 

<p><b>RUST:</b> How important is atmosphere to a good level, such as the story, the look and the use of sound to making a perfect level?</p> 

<p><font color=red><b>RD:</b> The story is irrelevant but i noticed if you use religious symbols that ppl will get obsessed about it. My map fy_satanchrist was banned from the internet and almost every mapping forum becuz I used the name jesus in the story. Those religious freaks need to get laid.</font></p> 

<p align = "center"><Img  border="0" width="250" src = "http://www.pitrd.com/pit/website/maps/screenshots/neighbours/cs_neighbours4.jpg"></br>Fy_Neighbours</p>

<p><font color=red><b>RD:</b> Yes sounds are important becuz ppl arent deaf. The perfect level also has sound just like it has grafix!!!</font></p>

<p><b>RUST:</b> It is obvious that you are an extremely good Mapper, but what would your weakness be, and what would you like to learn more about if given the opportunity?</p> 

<p><font color=red><b>RD:</b> I have no weaknesses and i want to learn to become more powerful in the future.</font></p>  

<p align = "center"><Img  border="0" width="250" src = "http://www.pitrd.com/pit/website/maps/screenshots/iban/iban1.JPG"></br>Ex_Iban</p>

<p><b>RUST:</b> What are you currently working on?</font></p> 

<p><font color=red><b>RD:</b> On several maps. I will finish if I have time. Pit is also working on maps and i will help him finish them or make some special effects.</font></p> 

<p><b>RUST:</b> How long does it take to make a great level, do you do sketches, write a story … etc?</font></p> 

<p><font color=red><b>RD:</b> I dont sketch or plan anything, I add the story at the end in 5 minutes. In total it can take from 1 week to 6 months to make a map. Sometimes it takes 6 months becuz then I dont have time.</font></p>

<p><b>RUST:</b> Have you ever joined a mod team, and what are the benefits of joining a Mod?</p> 

<p><font color=red><b>RD:</b> Yes I have and it died. I've learned from death.</font></p> 

<p><b>RUST:</b> You have developed a new website with Pit, <a href="http://www.pitrd.com">http://www.pitrd.com</a> This is a very interesting combination of Mapper and Cartoonist. How did you meet Pit and decide to merge your talents?</p> 

<p><font color=red><b>RD:</b> Pit is my twinbrother I met him inside my creator. He doesn't only do toons, he made many of the maps with me and some of them alone.</font></p> 

<p><b>RUST:</b>  <a href="http://www.pitrd.com/pit/website/maps/iceworld.html">fy_iceworld</a> is probably your most well known map, is there plans for a sequel. The simplist of the design, the boldness of the texture placement, will require some very good mapping to improve on perfect?</p>

<p><font color=red><b>RD:</b> What are u speeking of?iceworld sux.</font></p> 

<p><b>RUST:</b> LOL! Yes, it is a joke map. But a lot of people like the show of the web pages. Sulsa first pointed out your great marketing skills for Iceworld on the <a href="http://forums.gamedesign.net/viewtopic.php?t=5166">Rust Halflife Forums</a></p>

<p><b>RUST:</b> If I was to turn up on your doorstep on a weekend what would I find RD doing, do you have other interests outside of Mapping?</p>

<p><font color=red><b>RD:</b> It depends on when u drop by, I could be sleeping or typing an email. This is a difficult question, I have other interests but i dont like them.</font></p> 

<p><b>RUST:</b> As a Mapper, you have a rather unique RD-style, in that you always push the Engine you map in to the limit. With effects and layouts, and I must say you have the real looking cliffs I have ever seen in a game? What would you say defines the RD-style of mapping?</p> 

<p><font color=red><b>RD:</b> Lots of explosions and sounds</font></p> 

<p><b>RUST:</b> You have been active in the HalfLife Mapping and RUST forums for over four-five years now, how do think the HalfLife mapping community has changed over that time, and what do you think will happen in the future with the release of HalfLife 2?</p> 

<p><font color=red><b>RD:</b> I think most of the really skilled mappers have left by now, but there are still some left. And when HL2 is released then ofcorse most of em will switch to HL2.</font></p>

<p><b>RUST:</b> Have you ever thought about or dreamed about a full time job with a gaming company (actually I don’t know if this is a good question, for all I know you could be on the board of Epic!!!)</p> 

<p><font color=red><b>RD:</b> I havent dreamt about it ever. Usually i dream about weird stuff such as clowns scratching at my window or spiders walking into my mouth.</font></p>

<p><b>RUST:</b> Why did you choose map under the name of RD?</p> 

<p><font color=red><b>RD:</b> I took Realdespair becuz my twinbro took PIT, and there was a map called PIT of DESPAIR in doom1. But despair was a very common nick. I made it realdespair.</font></p> 

<p align = "center"><Img  border="0" width="250" src = "http://www.pitrd.com/pit/website/maps/screenshots/omg/omg2.JPG"></br>De_OMG</p>

<p><b>RUST:</b> Do you have any words of advice for and new or up and coming mappers?</p> 

<p><font color=red><b>RD:</b> Yes dont give up and dont listen to anybody except yourself. Only map what u want to play urself. Put religious symbols and touchy political subjects in the story and map then pimp ur map very aggressively and use the hype to get hits to ur site.</font></p>

<p><b>RUST:</b> Thank for your time RD</p> 

<p><font color=red><b>RD:</b> Cya</font></p>
