 <p><b>turret_breach</b>, <b>turret_base</b>, and <b>turret_driver</b> all must be 
	used together to create those cool gun turrets that are in 2 of the quake2 
	levels. These entities are by far the hardest I have come across to use in a 
	level and only advanced level editors should attempt this. I would of never of 
	figured it out if it wasn't for steve at the 
	<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/QuakeLab/QuakeLab2/"><b>quakelab</b></a> 
	telling me to specify an origin for the turret_breach and turret_base. We will 
	get to that though in due time.</p>

 <p>The first thing you need to do is to <b>create the gun</b>. This might take 
	awhile to make it look good. Here is a shot of the id one:</p>

 <p>You must also make everything <b>orientated towards angle 0</b>(straight right 
	from a top view), The trick is to kind of <b>make it into 2 parts. The barrel 
	and the base.</b> the barrel is the part that is going to be the turret_breach 
	and the base is going to be the turret_base. Also take into consideration that 
	the creature driving the gun will be standing on the turret_breach so actually 
	<b>the turret_breach will include the barrel and the platform that the 
	turret_driver will be standing on.</b> Here is another visual example to show you
	what the hell I am talking about:</p>

<center>
	Here is the barrel which includes the barrel and the platform for the driver to 
	stand on(<b>turret_breach</b>):<br>

	&nbsp;<br>
	Here is the base(<b>turret_base</b>):<br>
	<img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/turret/base.JPG" width="250" height="146" border="0" alt="turret_base"><br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Here is the barrel(<b>turret_breach</b>) and the base(<b>turret_base</b>) 
	together:<br>
	<img src="/content/quake2/tutorials/turret/both.jpg" width="250" height="70" border="0" alt="turret_breach and turret_base">
</center>

 <p>Once you get these 2 parts made then you must <b>select the barrel and make it a 
	turret_breach, and select the base and make it a turret_base.</b> Now you must 
	<b>give the turret_breach a targetname</b>. So for this example lets give it a 
	targetname of breach. <b>targetname=breach</b>. The turret_breach and the 
	turret_base go together so <b>they must be teamed</b>. To do this give each of 
	these entities the key value pair <b>team</b> with the same value. For this 
	example lets give them a team name of gun. So on <b>both</b> the turret_breach 
	and the turret_base there should be a key value pair of <b>team gun</b> Now you 
	must decide which direction you want your gun to point in the game and <b>set the
	key value pair angle to what ever direction you want the gun to point.</b> 
	<b>BOTH</b> the turret_breach and the turret_base should have the same angle. For
	this example we will set the angle to be 180. <b>angle 180</b>.</p>

 <p>Next thing you must do is create the target that the gun will shoot at. To do 
	this you must <b>create an info_notnull entity and place it at the tip of the 
	barrel and give it a targetname.</b> For this example our info_notnull will have 
	a targetname of tip. <b>targetname tip</b>. Then <b>set the target of the 
	turret_breach to the info_notnull</b>. <b><b>target=tip</b></b>.</p>

 <p>Next thing you need to do is to <b>create the turret_driver and target it to the 
	turret_breach.</b> target=breach. Place the turret_drive where you want him to be
	standing(on the platform you made him on the turret_breach).</p>

 <p>Now to the part that I couldn't figure out but steve at the 
	<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/quakelab/quakelab2/">quakelab</a> helped me 
	out on. For the turret_breach and the turret_base <b>you must have a brush set as
	an origin brush</b>. These will keep gun from rotating all around the room and 
	looking really messed up. So the turret_breach <b>must</b> have an origin brush 
	and the turret_base <b>must</b> have an origin brush. To make a brush an origin 
	brush you must <b>change the surface property</b> of that brush and set the 
	origin flag. This is done differently for each editor. Check your manual. It is 
	better to select origin brushes that for breach and the base that are near each 
	other. Here is a diagram of what brushes i made into origin brushes.</p>

 <p>Thats about all there is too it. As you can see this is a <b>very</b> difficult 
	entity to use. Not very fun at all. I urge you to download my 
	<a href="/content/quake2/tutorials/turret/rust7.zip?PHPSESSID=ad3ac358896dbd2fc9468826404153ce">example</a> map if you are going to try do this. If you still
	have problems post your question in the 
	<a href="http://forums.gamedesign.net/">Rust forums</a> and someone will give
	you a hand.</p></body></html>
