<b>Rust:</b> First of all, tell us a little bit about yourself and your position at Kodiak.
<br><br>
<b>Jason:</b> I'm 25 years old and in a crazy thing called the game industry. I was born and raised in Los Angelos CA areas, and moved around quite a bit after about the age of 17. I started with a couple of contract jobs in the business and moved around in a few different positions, from Level designer to producer, to plain old designer.
<br><br>
 
<b>Rust:</b> Has working as a professional in the gaming industry changed your views of gaming at all?
<br><br>
<b>Jason:</b> I don't really think so for me. At least when I got my first computer, I got Doom, and started editing games, I really dont play them much haha. All in all in a deep way though, I do tend to pick more at games then I used to when I was a child. 
<br><br> 

<b>Rust:</b> What do you feel is the most important part of level design?
<br><br> 
<b>Jason:</b> Personally I think it's all the elements we are expected to do these days. Atmoshphere, and gameplay especially. It can be boring running through a plain looking level that has good "gameplay" and vice versa. You need to draw them in with the right feel of the world, and of course, the gameplay can and should do the same thing.
<br><br> 

<b>Rust:</b> What limitations do you feel hurt you the most when designing game levels?
<br><br>
<b>Jason:</b> Time. If most developers had the time they wanted to make the levels they had originally planned, I bet alot of  games would be really cool. I have been on projects where stuff that was really cool, but took to much time just had to be cut out. Of course the compromise has to be made, but definatly it has to be time that takes away alot of the coolness in any game.
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> As professionals in the industry, what is the most common mistake you see in amateur maps?  What’s a common mistake you see other professionals make?
<br><br>
<b>Jason:</b> Not that anyone doesn't like to see a rehash of something else, but originality is hard to come by. Even for me. Most gameplay is all ripped from some where else, and then re-worked just a bit with a new touch to it.
<p>Dont get me wrong though, there are tons of original ideas that even amateur's do. (i hate that word becuase I still consider myself an amateur hehe) 
<p>But all in all, most professionals and amateurs tend not to make to many mistakes these days if they are serious about what they do.
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> When it comes down to pre-planning your levels, what do you do?
<br><br> 
<b>Jason:</b> Now a days, I sit, and I plan on paper, every single thing there is to plan for that level. I go step by step from begining to end. Draw basic 2d over head views, and if I can nag a artist for some concept visuals. 
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> What first sparked your interested in becoming a level designer in the game industry?
<br><br> 
<b>Jason:</b> DOOM!!!! It was more of a fact that I just didnt get how some one got into the biz. I mean, I wasnt familiar with the net at the time, and I dont think game companies posted to often on the net back then about work.
<p>So I kept editing from Doom and on, and realized that a creative job was something for me.
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> What were you doing before you worked at Kodiak? What do you envision yourself doing after your stint at Kodiak?
<br><br>
<b>Jason:</b> Well, my official title was "Executive Producer of Content Creation for 3d Marketing" at S3 Inc. Was strictly contract and I was about to go full time and they shut the doors at S3 Inc.
<p>Where I will be I dont know. If I move out of the game industry, I have recently been considering going into some feild of science. Astronomy or Micro Biology are just a couple that interest me. As crazy as it sounds, even archeology.
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> While you’re not designing games, what are you doing in your spare time?
<br><br>
<b>Jason:</b> Making muZaK. Or music in other words. Ranging from using Acid Pro with loops, or playing my guitar. Which actually this is turning into work now to. I have recently been doing some music for one of our games here at work, and it seems its going to continue.
<p>Or I got out and get plastered with my friends on the weekends. One of the above two apply.
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> What sources do you use for inspiration? 
<br><br>
<b>Jason:</b> Still images, from conceptual to photographic. Movies, and just my own twisted mind.
<p>The list can last a while really if I named every single thing though.
