<p><b>Common Compiling terms:</b><br>
This information was sourced from Mithodical Construction. <br>
It provides a good brief background on common mapping terms. While the heading say's compiling terms, the terms themselves are generic to most mapping applications and editors.<br> There are more comprehensive lists out there, but the reason I like this one, is that it deals with complex terms in a simple fashion.</p>

<p><b>Compiling Terms You Should Know</b>:<br>
Compiling a map is a technical process. Like any technical process, there are particular terms associated with it that you should have some understanding of before you begin. </p>
<p><b>Brush</b>:<br>
Any three-dimensional convex solid, containing at least four faces. Brushes are used to construct the geometry of the map, as well as define the "air" space that the player can move in. Brushes in Quake, Doom and Half-Life must be convex. </p>
<p><b>Concave</b>:<br>
Describes a three-dimensional figure (such as a collection of brushes) in which some of its faces point toward each other. A figure is concave if it is possible to draw a line segment from one face to another while going outside of the figure. In many engines, concave brushes are invalid. </p>
<p><b>Convex </b>:<br> 
Describes a three-dimensional figure (such as a brush) in which all of its faces point away from each other. A figure is convex if it is not possible to draw a line segment from one face to another while going outside of the figure. 
In most engines, all brushes must be convex. </p>
<p><b>Coplanar </b>:<br> 
Describes two or more faces) that lie in the same plane in three-dimensional space. Coplanar faces appear to be one unbroken surface to the human eye, but are actually separate surfaces. These coplanar surfaces have normals (vectors that indicate the facing of the surfaces) pointing in the same direction. <br>
In the Half-Life engine, two faces may be coplanar only if they lie on separate brushes. Coplanar are faces on the same brush are invalid in the HL engine because of the requirement that every brush must be convex. </p>
<p><b>Edge </b>:<br> 
The line segment connecting two vertices, this is also the bounding line where two faces of a brush meet. </p>
<p><b>Entity </b>:<br> 
An item in your map that has a specific function, other than to define the world that the player moves in. Entities define the items in the map that the player can interact with, and the items that have special properties, such as transparency. Entities can also be used for lighting purposes. <br>
Entities fall into two main categories: point-based entities and brush-based entities. Point-based entities define objects in your map that either have no visible representation in your map (like info_player_start, for example) or that take their appearance from a finite set of possibilities (such as monster_generic, whose appearance is limited to the number of models stored on your computer). brush-based entities define objects in your map that have potentially infinite shapes and sizes, but similar behavior (such as func_door and func_train). Any entity that defines an area of activation is also brush-based (such as trigger_multiple). </p>
<p><b>Face </b>:<br> 
A side of a brush. In the Half-Life engine, each face must represent a flat plane in three-dimensional space. Each brush face is painted with an associated texture. </p>
<p><b>Hull </b>:<br> 
A three-dimensional figure formed by a set of points in three-dimensional space. The shape of a hull is determined by the method of determining which figure it forms. In the Half-Life engine, the vertices of the brushes determine the points in the hull. The compile tools then calculate four different hulls; one of them is the visual hull, which represents what the player can see within the map, and the other three are collision hulls, which represent the areas of the map that the player can move through. </p>
<p><b>Leaf (plural leaves)</b>:<br> 
A section of "air" space inside of your map. The compile tools break up the brushes in your map into polygons, and also subdivide the internal player space into sections called leaves. Leaves are used by the engine to determine which polygons to draw based on where the player is located in the map (not on which way the player is facing!) </p>
<p><b>Leak </b>:<br>
A section of your map where the inside of the map (the player space) is visible to the space outside of the map (the "void"). Think of your map as a space station. If the "air" space inside the map is exposed to the space outside of the map, the air will escape. That is a leak. This is a serious problem, since it stops visibility calculations (the compile tools cannot comprehend an infinitely large section of "air" space), and prevents realistic lighting (which relies on the visibility calculations). </p>
<p><b>Patch</b>:<br> 
(1) A software update that succeeds in fixing parts of the software that were broken, and in breaking parts of the software that were already fixed.  <br>
(2) A plane area in your map used for lighting purposes. The radiosity (lighting) tool splits your map into patches and then calculates the color and intensity of the light falling on each patch. </p>
<p><b>Plane </b>:<br> 
A flat surface in three-dimensional space that extends forever into infinity. This term is also an adjective that describes a figure that is flat in three-dimensional space (otherwise known as a polygon). 
In the Half-Life engine, planes are used for many purposes, including rendering and lighting. All brushes in your map must have faces that are planes. Faces are planes if all of their vertices lie in the same plane. The compile tools will choke on any brush that does not have planar faces. </p>
<p><b>Polygon </b>:<br> 
A two-dimensional plane figure existing in three-dimensional space. In the Half-Life engine (and most others), the term "polygon" more specifically means "triangle", since the triangle is the simplest polygon to render in a three-dimensional game engine (it always forms a flat surface in three-dimensional space). The compile tools subdivide the engine-visible portions of your map brushes into triangles for rendering purposes. The engine itself uses polygons to render other items in your map, such as monsters, players, items, and weapons. <br>
Polygons fall into two classes in the Half-Life engine: world polygons (abbreviated "wpolys"), which define the map geometry; and entity polygons (abbreviated "epolys"), which form the various and sundry things populating your map. </p>
<p><b>Portal </b>:<br> 
The boundary plane between two leaves of "air" space. Portals are used by the compile tools to determine which leaves are visible from one another. </p>
<p><b>Texture </b>:<br> 
A two-dimensional bitmap applied to a face of a brush. Textures are used to give brush faces the appearance of a real surface, such as a concrete slab or a metal plate. The skilled use of textures can give a surface a three-dimensional appearance without the need for polygon-intensive map geometry. </p>
<p><b>Vertex (plural vertices)</b>:<br> 
The point where two edges of a face meet. By moving the vertices of a brush, you can change its shape, although you must make sure that the vertices form faces that are flat planes. </p>

<B>By <a href="mailto:Bobby@ionstorm.com">Bobby Pavlock</a><br><BR>
Level Designer - <a href="http://www.ionstorm.com">Ion Storm</a></B>
<BR><BR>
<h3>WHATS THE PROBLEM?</h3>

The idea of making natural-looking terrain was brought to the mainstream with Quake 2.  Some of the outdoor areas in Quake 2 were awe-inspiring compared to what we were used to.  Yet, even the revolutionary outdoor areas found in Quake 2 have quickly become sub-par when compared to some of the terrain found in many of the newer games.  So how is it that level designers are able to make such convincing terrain without sacrificing gameplay?  Well that's what I'm going to attempt to show you in this tutorial.
<br><br>
Before I started working at Ion Storm, I was like many of you reading this - an aspiring amateur level designer, looking to hopefully one day make my way into the industry.  As an amateur, one of my biggest struggles was making cool-looking outdoor terrain, while keeping the r_speeds low enough to not affect gameplay.  Regardless of how many approaches I tried to use, it just didn't seem to want to work.  Then, when I arrived here at Ion Storm, I quickly discovered an extremely simple but effective method of constructing natural terrain - the "triangle method".  I don't know if that's what it's really called, or if it even has a proper name, but that's what I call it.
<br><br>
Basically, all you do is make a grid of triangular-shaped brushes, and then raise/lower vertices.  Sounds easy, huh?  With the triangle method, a level designer of any skill level, can easily make convincing natural terrain, and keep the r_speeds down to a minimum.  Interested?  Read on…

<h3>WHAT'S THIS "TRIANGLE METHOD"?</h3>

The triangle method for making natural terrain is so simple, that you'll ask yourself why in the hell you never thought of it.  For this tutorial, I will be constructing an example map.  The example map will simply be a small section of a canyon area.
<br><br>
The first thing I am going to do is decide how I want my canyon to flow.  When I have come up with the general idea of what I want the area to look like, I begin by drawing an outline of the canyon area using brushes with a sky texture.  Don't overcomplicate this part of it.  Some people, in an effort to be random, will draw the outline of the area with brushes going in all sorts of different angles.  While being random is they key to making convincing natural terrain, we can hold off on the random part til later.  Here's what the outline of my canyon area looks like…
<br><br>
<CENTER><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/terrain_fig1.jpg"  border=0 alt="terrain_fig1.jpg"></CENTER>
<br><br>
Now that I have the outline of my area, the next step is to fill this area with a grid of triangle brushes, which will make up the ground for my canyon area.  Here is where the random part comes in.  Don't be afraid to make your triangles be all different shapes and sizes.  You don't find too many outdoor areas that are all neat and orderly, so don't try to make your outdoor area neat and orderly.  The only thing to remember when filling your area with this grid of triangle brushes is to make sure that all your triangle brushes meet at the vertices.  Don't have the vertex of one triangle brush meeting the side of another triangle brush.  This will cause problems in the next step.  Here is what my map looks like after filling the canyon area with a grid of triangle brushes…
<br><br>
<CENTER><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/terrain_fig2.jpg"  border=0 alt="terrain_fig1.jpg"></CENTER>
<br><br>
Ok, once you have your area filled with triangles, the next step is to go through and raise/lower vertices to give the ground an uneven, natural look.  I usually prefer to start in a corner area.  Simply select one of the triangle brushes, go into vertex manipulation mode, and raise or lower the vertices to your liking.  In this example I have started off by raising 2 of the vertices of the triangle brush I selected by 32 units, and leaving the third in its original position.  Here's what it looks like…
<br><br>
<CENTER><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/terrain_fig3.jpg"  border=0 alt="terrain_fig3.jpg"></CENTER>
<br><br>
Once I have that brush adjusted how I want it, then I select the neighboring brush, and raise/lower any adjoining vertices between the 1st and 2nd brushes until the vertices of the 2nd brush match the position of the vertices of the 1st brush.  Any vertices that are not shared between the 2 brushes you can manipulate however you like.  Here is what it looks like after manipulating the vertices of the 2nd brush to match those of the 1st brush…
<br><br>
<CENTER><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/terrain_fig4.jpg"  border=0 alt="terrain_fig4.jpg"></CENTER>
<br><br>
As you can see, by making sure all the triangles in the grid meet at the vertices, aligning the heights of 2 neighboring brushes is very easy.  However, if you have a vertex of one triangle brush meeting the side of a neighboring triangle brush, then it becomes more difficult to get the heights of the 2 brushes, and any other brushes that meet at that point, to match.  So to be safe and make it easier on yourself, make sure all your triangles meet at the vertices.
<br><br>
Believe it or not, that's all there it to it.  All you do now is simply go through the grid, raising/lowering the vertices of the rest of the triangle brushes.  Obviously, the more you raise/lower the vertices the more uneven the ground is going to look.  For example, if you want the ground to have a subtle, natural roll to it, then raise/lower the vertices less.  In this example, I am adjusting the vertices by 32 units.  Also, the more triangles you use in an area, the smoother, and more natural, the ground will look.  Just be careful not to go crazy with it, or else you might begin to sacrifice those precious r_speeds.
<br><br>
After you have the ground looking the way you want, then add some rocks or walls or whatever you want, and you're done!  Now wasn't that easy?  Here are a couple pics of the canyon area I made, after all was said and done…
<br><br>
<CENTER><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/terrain_pic1.jpg"  border=0 alt="terrain_pic1.jpg"></CENTER>
<br><br>
<CENTER><img src="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/images/terrain_pic2.jpg"  border=0 alt="terrain_pic2.jpg"></CENTER>
<br><br>
Notice how the ground has that natural, uneven look to it?  And check out those r_speeds, with rocks and everything!  Obviously there's a lot of room r_speed-wise for adding even more detail to this canyon area, but for the purposes of this little tutorial, I think this is good enough.
<br><br>
I hope you enjoyed this little tutorial on making natural terrain.  And I hope you find the "triangle method" as easy and useful as I have.  If you want to take a look at the <a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/files/terraintut.zip">example map</a> I used for this tutorial you can download it <a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/miniwood/tutorials/files/terraintut.zip">here</a>.  Best of luck in making some cool-ass outdoor areas in your levels!
</ul><h1 id="275" name="275" class="book-h1">Elements Of CTF Style</h1><ul><H2>Elements of CTF Style</H2>
<B>By CDC-Bone</B>
<BR><BR>

<I>Note: The following was written with Quake 2 very much in mind but applies to CTF levels in general</I>
<BR><BR>
It's amazing what kind of response one can get from the Quake community when one puts out the call for maps.  When I decided to start a Quake 2 CTF Expansion Pack, I had a couple of dedicated mappers and a need for a good selection of maps from outside sources.
<br><br>
What I've found is a pretty general tendancy for map makers to design their levels for deathmatch.  They then throw in a small flag room and call it a CTF level.  Let me state this explicitly and as plainly as possible.  Deathmatch levels and CTF levels have very different design philosophies.  Just like single player levels can be played as deathmatch, they will never be as good as a dedicated deathmatch level that was designed from the ground up for that purpose.
<br><br>
So, what design philosophies must one have in order to make a playable CTF level?  This article will hopefully give you some pointers as to what enhances a CTF level and what pitfalls to avoid. These are my opinions, which you may or may not agree with.  I don't mind at all.  Go ahead and break all the rules and create a kickass CTF level to prove me wrong :).  I guarantee I'd love to play it.
<br><br>
By the way, I use the CTF level &quot;Ruins of Neominonk&quot; consistently throughout this article to prove my points.  If you hated Neominonk, then you will disagree with every suggestion I make below.  I consider Neominonk to be about as close to perfection as a CTF level as one can get.

<h3>Flag rooms:</h3>

Flag rooms need to be created with very conservative poly counts. Remember, this is the room in which most of the massive firefights will take place on your level.  If you keep the structure simple and straightforward, the low poly counts will contribute to less lagg. Try to show your architectural genius in other parts of the level that won't have as much travel or gunfights.  There's nothing worse than trying to escape from a base with the flag and having to contend with the rendering lag.
<br><br>
A corollary to this is keeping the flag room to a relatively small size.  You can always have the area right outside the base be massive and full of open space.  This is to allow the flag carrier a few moments after grabbing the flag where he doesn't have to worry about lagging out because of being in a huge open area with lots of firing going on.
<br><br>
Remember, when you ask players why they dislike a level, the most common answer (after you get past the subjective artistic comments) is the presence of lag in the base.

<h3>The Base:</h3>

I'm seperating the team base from the flag room because often times the base can extend well past the immediate environment of the flag room.  The best example of this concept is in the level &quot;Ruins of Neominonk&quot;.  You have the flag room, and then you have an area just outside the flag room with a set of stairs and a walkway leading out into the next room.

<br><br>
I have a simple rule of thumb that I like to follow when designing bases.  The number of routes into and out of the base must be strictly controlled.  Given the fact that most matches (and on most public servers) average 5 or 6 players on a team, the number of defenders in the base are actually quite limited.  If you give the flag carrier too many routes out of the base, the game will degenerate into a bunch of chases rather than the more static aspect of setting defensive posts.  Levels which induce the &quot;chase&quot; circumstances tend to be levels where teamwork is at its weakest as there is little to no inducement to stay in base and defend it.
<br><br>
I (somewhat pompously) call this rule of thumb &quot;Bone's law of 2/3rds&quot;.  It's listed below:
<br><br>
Either-
<blockquote>Have 2 entrances and 1 dedicated exit.<br>or...<br>Have 1 dedicated entrance and 2 exits.<br>or...<br>Have 2 entrances that double as exits and no dedicated route in or out.</blockquote>

<br><br>
By dedicated I mean that you can ONLY use it for that specific route (in or out).  Neominonk follows this law to perfection (all good levels do).  Neominonk has 2 entrances into the base and 1 dedicated exit through a lower tunnel that leads to a lava pit.

<h3>Design for the grapple but do not depend on it:</h3>

Sadly this is the most common mistake made by novice CTF level makers.  They create a level with areas that can only be accessed and exited from using the grapple.  Some have even positioned the flag so that the player must grapple to it to grab it.<br><br>
The level should be playable in every respect without the use of the grapple.  I can't make it any clearer than that.  Weapons, ammo, flags, and other items should be accessible to the non grapple user. 
<br><br>
Does that mean that EVERYTHING on the level should be accessible to the non grapple user?  Not at all!  I'm saying that not using the grapple shouldn't make the level unplayable.
<br><br>
Why is this rule important?  It's no surprise to anyone who has played Quake 2 CTF for any length of time at all that switching to the grapple takes about 1.5 seconda, and the rate at which the grapple fires is somewhat...slow.  Forcing people to constantly switch from their weapons to the grapple in order to navigate the level will frustrate people to no end.
<br><br>
As a flag carrier fighting for his life to capture, I would not want to play on a level that would force me to stop firing my weapon and switch to grapple in order to complete the capture.  I would much rather hunt down the author of that level and take away his toys until he learned not to abuse them :).

<h3>Avoid the BFG and spare the Hyperblaster:</h3>

This rule caused somewhat of a disagreement between Zoid and I during one of his chats on #q2ctf on irc.gamesnet.net.  I stand by it, however.  The BFG is too powerful of a defense buster to be used in CTF.  I see it every day on Quake 2 CTF servers on &quot;McKinley Revival&quot;.
<br><br>
The fact is that although McKinley Revival provides places to hide from a BFG blast, the very act of hiding means that the defense can't do its job of DEFENDING THE FLAG.  The offense can fire off several BFG blasts in a row to keep the defense's heads down while the flag carrier safely and easily runs away without any contention. This means that defending in McKinley Revival against even a moderately competant offense is a futile gesture.
<br><br>
My objections to the hyperblaster isn't for gameplay reasons. Frankly, the hyperblaster lags any HPB on a less than perfect connection.  A hyperblaster weilded by a player with the Haste Tech will even lag a 28.8K modem on a chrystal clear connect with no packet loss.  There's just too much information sent down the line when a Haste-ed hyperblaster fires for an HPB modem to keep up with.
<br><br>
This has made q2ctf5 virtually unplayable by most HPB players. Even Zoid recognized this.  There might be a change to the code base in the future which will turn hyperblaster bolts into a special entity that is kept track of on the client side (so no bandwidth is wasted updating the position of the hyperblaster bolts).  Once this is fixed, I would have no objections to having a hyperblaster on my level.

<h3>Keep people hungry for armor:</h3>

How many times has this happened to you?  Some guy with a power shield and the Protection rune waltzes into your base, takes the flag, and moseys back to his base.  You chain-gun him until you run out of bullets.  You put a double barrel to the back of his head and pump rounds into him all the way back until he captures your flag.
<br><br>
The fact is that the power shield is too powerful.  You can combine power armor and body armor to get 400+ points of armor.  Not only that, but anyone wearing power armor will NOT be damaged in any way until the power runs out.  Given the relative size of most levels, frankly you just may not have the time to wear down the defenses of the flag carrier in time before he caps, no matter how many rounds you pump into him.
<br><br>
This leads to a &quot;to heck with this, I can be frustrated doing other things like trying to get a date tonight&quot; attitude.  Even though Zoid reduced the effectiveness of the power armor in the most recent CTF release, you can still run into situations where a flag carrier can be impervious to damage.
<br><br>
The answer?  Keep 'em armor hungry!  Full body armor should be a specialty item like the megahealth and the quad.  Combat armor should be used sparingly (like 1 in each base).  Jacket armor and armor shards (use few of these as well since they can accumulate to large amounts of armor fairly quickly) should be the main staple diet of defensive wardrobes. 
 

<h3>Keep people hungry for ammo:</h3>

I have played CTF levels where it's impossible to run out of railgun/rocket ammo.  You literally can collect so much of it that you max out in a very short time.  While some people don't see this as a problem, I submit that ammo control is an integral part of teamplay.  
It's also a great control on how effective the Big Weapons can be on a level.  If you have to ration out the use of the big damage weapons, you will be forced to rely on outthinking the flag carrier rather than overpowering him with sheer volume of fire.  This presents problems for the poor guy with Haste, but he can make up for his chronic lack of ammo by using less powerful weapons at twice the fire rate.
<br><br>

I always suggest laying in a good store of bullets and shotgun shells throughout the flag room and base.  Keep the rockets/slugs away from the bases (or a VERY limited supply within the base) to force the defenders to come out and rearm if they want to keep using the Big Weapons.
<br><br>
Obviously if you ignore the above rule and go armor crazy, you'll need a supply of ammo commesurate with the volume of fire needed to take down a guy with 400+ points of armor.  You can't apply one of these rules and not the other.
<br><br>
Remember, tension and intensity arises from fear.  With these two rules you should keep the players in constant fear of dying with the flag or running out of ammo trying to defend it.  Just don't go TOO crazy with the starvation and leave people running around the level using nothing but a blaster.  Remember, the small guns should have plenty of ammo lying around (shells/bullets).  The Big Weapons should be limited and not easily accessible by defenders.

<h3>Gameflow:</h3>

This is what sets CTF maps far apart from DM-only maps and single player maps.  While DM-only maps tend to have a flow pattern that is a circlular in nature, CTF maps are almost totally linear.  This isn't to say that CTF maps are designed in one straight line (though many are).
<br><br>
There are 5 parts to any well designed CTF level.  There are the 2 bases (in this case we include the flag rooms), we have the outer entrance to the bases (1 for each base), and we have the battlefield which is usually located equidistant to each base.
<br><br>
The flow should always go directly from each area into its adjacent area.  If you have a route that goes off into never-never land, just lop it off.
<br><br>

This does not mean that you can't have multiple routes through each area, but all routes should lead to the next area in the progression.


<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

I want to take a moment here to point out a pretty damned good CTF level that breaks nearly every applicable rule I stated above. That's American McGee's Capturephobopolous (I probably mangled that). It's proof that a good level designer can break the rules and still come out with a good CTF level.

<!--break-->
<p>A Technical Overview 60 frames per second vs. 30 frames per second has been one of the most contested ideas around the web and in print for the last year(<b>1998</b>). Today we will look to see who is right, who is wrong, and who is just plain confused.</p>
<p>Chipmaker (and now boardmaker) 3dfx has been evangelising gaming at 60 fps since the Voodoo 2 was released. Many have looked down upon 3dfx for this due to the common misconception that humans cannot distinguish framerates over 30 fps, so what is the point of having visuals running at 60 fps? Misconception you say? Yes. In this article we will look behind the technology of games, computers, movies, and television and the physiology and neuro-ethology of the human visual system. Movies I have seen film students write in to columns about how anything over 24 fps is wasted. Why 24 fps? Movies in theatres run at 24 fps. They seem pretty smooth to me, so why would we need more? Well, let's take a look at movies from the eyes' perspective. First off, you are sitting in a dark movie theatre and the projector is flashing a really bright light on a highly reflective screen. What does this do? Have you ever had a doctor flash a bright light in your eye to look at your retina? Most of us have. What happens? A thing called "afterimage". When the doctor turns off the bright light, you see an afterimage of the light (and it is not real comfortable). Movie theatres do the same thing. The light reflected off the screen is much brighter than the theatre surroundings. You get an afterimage of the screen after the frame is passed on, so the next frame change is not as noticeable.</p>
<p>Screen refresh is also a very important factor in this equation. Unlike a television or a computer monitor, the movie theatre screen is refreshed all at once (the entire frame is instantly projected and not drawn line for line horizontally as in a TV or monitor). So every frame is projected in its entirety all at once. This then leads back to afterimage due to the large neurotransmitter release in the retina.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important factor in the theatre is the artefact known as "motion blur". Motion blur is the main reason why movies can be shown at 24 fps, therefore saving Hollywood money by not having to make the film any longer than possible (30 fps for a full feature film would be approximately 20% longer than a film shown at 24 fps, that turns out to be a lot of money). What motion blur does is give the impression of more intervening frames between the two actual frames. If you stop a movie during a high action scene with lots of movement, the scene that you will see will have a lot of blur, and any person or thing will be almost unrecognisable with highly blurry detail. When it is played at full 24 fps, things again look good and sharp. The human eye is used to motion blur (later on that phenomena) so the movie looks fine and sharp. TV, Video Tape, and DVD TV's run at a refresh rate of 60 Hz. This is not bad for viewing due to the distance we usually sit from the TV, and the size of the phosphors on your average set and the distance between phosphors (between .39 for a high end one, to .5 and higher for cheaper models). This is actually quite big and fuzzy for most of us, but as long as we are not doing any kind of productivity software (such as word processing) and just watching movies at least 6 feet from the TV, that is just fine.</p>
<p>Now TV transmissions, video tape, and DVD play at 30 fps. The increase from movies is due mostly to the environment that the TV is watched in. It is usually quite a bit brighter than in a movie theatre, and most importantly a TV does not do a full screen refresh, rather each frame is drawn line by line horizontally by an electron gun hitting the phosphors in the screen. So basically each frame is drawn twice by the TV (60 refreshes per second, 30 frames per second). Now because the frame rate is * the refresh, transitions between frames go a lot smoother than if you had say a 72 Hz refresh and a movie playing at 30 fps. Don't ask me why, it is due to wave behaviour, which is higher level physics, and I can't go into that without making this a 30 page paper. Needless to say, the physics behind this make video and DVD look very smooth.</p>
<p>Motion blur again is a very important part to making videos look seamless. With motion blur, those two refreshes per frame give the impression of two frames to our eyes. This makes a really well encoded DVD look absolutely incredible. Another factor to consider is that neither movies or videos dip in frame rate when it comes to complex scenes. With no frame rate drops, the action is again seamless.</p>
<p>Games on the Computer This is the second toughest part of this article. TV and Movies are easy to understand, and the technology behind it is also easy to understand. Computers and the way games are projected to us is a lot more complex (the most complex is the actual physiology /neuro-ethology of the visual system).<br>
First off, the hardware used for visualisation (namely the monitor) is a very fine piece of equipment. It has a very small dot pitch (distance between phosphors) and the phosphors themselves are very fine, so we can get exquisite detail. We set the refresh rates at over 72 Hz for comfort (flicker free). This makes a very nice canvas to display information on, unfortunately because it is so fine it can greatly magnify flaws in the output of a video card. We will get into refresh in the section on the human eye.<br>
Let us start with how a scene or frame is set up by the computer. Each frame is put together in the frame buffer of the video card and is then sent out through the RAMDAC to the monitor. That part is very easy, nothing complex there (except the actual setup of the frame). Now each frame is perfectly rendered and sent to the monitor. It looks good on the screen, but there is something missing when that action gets fast. So far, programmers have been unable to make motion blur in these scenes. When a game runs at 30 fps, you are getting 30 perfectly rendered scenes. This does not fool the eye one bit. There is no motion blur, so the transition from frame to frame is not as smooth as in movies. 3dfx put out a demo that runs half the screen at 30 fps, and the other half at 60 fps. There is a definite difference between the two scenes, with the 60 fps looking much better and smoother than the 30 fps.<br>
The lack of motion blur with current rendering techniques is a huge setback for smooth playback. Even if you could put motion blur into games, it really is not a good idea whatsoever. We live in an analog world, and in doing so, we receive information continuously. We do not perceive the world through frames. In games, motion blur would cause the game to behave erratically. An example would be playing a game like Quake II, if there was motion blur used, there would be problems calculating the exact position of an object, so it would be really tough to hit something with your weapon. With motion blur in a game, the object in question would not really exist in any of the places where the "blur" is positioned. So we have perfectly drawn frames, so objects are always able to be calculated in set places in space. So how do you simulate motion blur in a video game? Easy, have games go at over 60 fps! Why? Read the section on the human eye.<br>
Variations in frame rate also contribute to games looking jerky. In any game, there is an average frame rate. Rates can be as high as the refresh rate of your monitor (70+), or it can go down in the 20's to 30's. This can really affect the visual quality of the game, and in fast moving ones can actually be detrimental to your gameplaying performance. One of the great ideas that came from the now defunct Talisman project at Microsoft was the ability to lock frame rates (so the rate goes neither above or below a certain framerate). In the next series of graphics cards, we may see this go into effect.</p>
<p>The Human Eye (and Visual Cortex) Here is where things get a little interesting, and where we will see that humans can perceive up to 60+ fps.<br>
Light is focused onto the retina of the eye by the lens. Light comes in a steady stream and not pulses (ok, so this is a little wrong, but we are not talking about the dual nature of light, where it acts as both a particle -photon- and a wave). Again, we live in an analog world, where information is continuously streamed to us. The retina interprets light in several ways with two types of cells. Rods and Cones make up the receiving cells for light. Intensity, color, and position (relative to where the cell is on the retina) is the information transmitted by the retina to the optic nerve, which then sends that info to the Visual Cortex for it to be translated to our conscious self (whoa, went from science to philosophy in one step!).<br>
Rods are the simpler of the two cell types, as it really only interprets position and intensity. Rods are essentially colour blind, and are referred to as transmitting in black and white. The black and white is not really true, but rather it is just intensity of the light hitting the cell. Rods are also very fast due to the basic nature of intensity. The amount of neurotransmitter released is basically the amount of light that is stimulating the rod. The more light, the more neurotransmitter. Rods are also much more sensitive than cones. How is this proven? We know by microscopic examination of the retina shows that there is a much greater concentration of rods on the outer edges. A simple experiment that you can do yourself is to go out on a starry night and look at the stars out of your peripheral vision. Pick out a faint star from your periphery and then look at it directly. It should disappear, and when you again turn and look at it from the periphery, it will pop back into view.<br>
Cones are the second cell type, and these are much more complex. There are three basic parts to them that absorb different wavelengths of light and release differing amounts of different neurotransmitters depending on the wavelength and intensity of that light. Basically there are three receptors in a cone that absorb red, green, and blue wavelengths of light. Each of these receptors release a different neurotransmitter for the colour, with differing amounts of the neurotransmitter depending on the intensity of the wavelength. Purple is a combination of blue and red, so the red and blue receptors would release differing amounts of neurotransmitter, while the green wouldn't release any. This information then passes onto your visual cortex and we "see" purple. Cones are much more inefficient than rods due to their more complex nature. They also are a little slower to react to changes in light and are also not as sensitive as rods (see above experiment). Cones are what largely make up the centre of the retina and fovea (focal point of the retina).<br>
The optic nerve is the highway from which information is passed from the eye to the visual cortex in the brain. This nerve is just a pathway, and does no processing on its own. Its bandwidth is actually really huge, so a lot of information can be passed on. Nerve impulses also travel at over 200 mph to the brain, so it is nearly instantaneous for information to be received from the eye (since the optic nerve is only about 2 cm to 3 cm long).<br>
The visual cortex is where all the information is put together. Humans only have so much room in the brain, so there are some tricks it uses to give us the most information possible in the smallest, most efficient structure. One of these tricks is the property of motion blur. We cannot get away from the phenomena because it is so important to the way we perceive the world. In the visual cortex we can theorise the existence of what I call the motion blur filter. Because the eye can only receive so much information, and the visual cortex can only process so much of that, there needs to be a way to properly visualise the world. This is where it gets tough.<br>
Take for example a fast moving object. The faster it goes, the more it blurs (be it a snowflake or a train). Why does this happen? Let's take the example of a snowflake. At any time it has a fixed position in the universe, no matter what speed it goes at (unless it starts to get relativistic, then we go into some strange physics, but something that is not applicable to what we are talking about). Lets say at 5 mph, we see the snowflake in perfect detail as it falls to the ground. Now we hop into a car and go 55 mph. Can we see the detail of the snowflake? No, it is just a streak to us. Has the snowflake changed itself? Of course not. If we had a really fast camera with a fast shutter speed, it would see the snowflake in perfect detail. Now due to the speed in which our eyes/visual cortex can process information, we cannot see the snowflake in detail. A bird such as an eagle would be able to see more detail and not so much of a streak because it only has rods (it is colour blind) and the distance from the eyes to its highly specialised visual cortex is 1/16th the distance of ours. This leads to more information being pumped into the visual cortex. So what would look like a streak to us would look like a fast moving snowflake to the eagle.<br>
If we didn't have the ability to produce motion blur, we would see the snowflake pop in and out of existence at high speeds. We would first see it one place, then it would disappear and pop into existence several feet beyond depending on the direction it is going. Is this a good thing? No, we would have a hard time figuring out the direction of the snowflake and have many problems with perceiving movement in three dimensional space. With motion blur we get the impression of continuity where our hardware cannot distinguish fine detail while the object is moving at high speeds.<br>
Contrary to the belief that we cannot distinguish anything over 30 fps, we can actually see and recognise speeds up to 70+ fps. How can you test this? You can quickly do this with your monitor at home. Set the refresh rate to 60 Hz and stare at it for a while. You can actually see the refreshes and it is very tiring to your eyes. Now if we couldn't see more than 30 fps, why is it that flicker free is considered to be 72 Hz (refreshes per second). You can really tell if the refresh is below 72 by turning your head and looking at the screen through your peripheral vision. You can definitely see the screen refreshes then (due to rods being much more efficient and fast).</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b>:<br> We as humans have a very advanced visual system. While some animals out there have sharper vision, there is usually something given up with it (for eagles there is colour, for owls it is the inability to move the eye in its socket). We can see in millions of colours (women can see up to 30% more colours than men, so if a woman doesn't think your outfit matches, she is probably right, go change), we have highly movable eyes, and we can perceive up to and over 60 fps. We have the ability to focus as close as an inch, and as far as infinity, and the time it takes to change focus is faster than the fastest, most expensive auto-focusing camera out there. We have a field of view that encompasses almost 170 degrees of sight, and about 30 degrees of fine focus. We receive information constantly and are able to decode it very quickly.<br>
So what is the answer to how many frames per second should we be looking for? Anything over 60 fps is adequate, 72 fps is maximal (anything over that would be overkill). Framerates cannot drop though from that 72 fps, or we will start to see a degradation in the smoothness of the game. Don't get me wrong, it is not bad to play a game at 30 fps, it is fine, but to get the illusion of reality, you really need a frame rate of 72 fps. What this does is saturate the pipeline from your eyes to your visual cortex, just as reality does. As visual quality increases, it really becomes more important to keep frame rates high so we can get the most immersive feel possible. While we still may be several years away from photographic quality in 3D accelerators, it is important to keep the speed up there.<br>
Looks like 3dfx isn't so full of it.</p>

<I>(excerpt from Design doc for <A HREF="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/r/?page=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/data/gamehomepages/game_homepage_id.php(que)id=2395">Prax War</A>, originally appeared in a .plan update on June 6, 1998. Reprinted with permission)</I>

<P>I wrote the following text for a preliminary design document for Prax War about a year ago for EA legend Richard Hilleman.I found it recently and realized it presents several axioms and principles of game design that others might take an interest in.</P>
<P>
Note: Some of the text below refers to 'game skills' that have been 'categorized above'. This is referring to the entire skill set for the game Prax War which, for obvious reason, I haven't included here. So, you won't be finding any 'game skills' above the text that mentions them.</P>

<H3>A Word About Game Skills:</H3>

<P>The execution of any game skill during the learning phase of that skill should properly reward the player for success. The reward could simply be a sense of accomplishment, it could also be the availability of a game item or powerup, or it could even be a game cinematic sequence.</P>

<P>The value of the reward will often be dictated by the importance of the skill and challenge, the difficulty of its execution and penalty for failure (risk of execution). Often, the difficulty of the challenge and the penalty for failure will be inversely proportional. Only in advanced levels or critical moments of game play do both risk and difficulty escalate proportionally. The idea here is that if the move is difficult, the game designer shouldn't automatically kill the player for failing the move. If the move is simple, like walking across a wide catwalk, the risk can be great (falling to your death). At first, the challenge of the game is in developing the skills the game requires. Another challenge that is introduced during the game is the combination of game skills to create a puzzle.</P>

<H3>Game Puzzles and Game Skills:</H3>

<P>Besides the skills the player must develop to succeed, Prax War will challenge the player with puzzles that assume game skills already exist. In this game, a "puzzle" is defined as a specific challenge set up by the game designer which requires two or more skills and knowledge of the correct solution to complete. For example, jumping up to a higher ledge is not a puzzle - it's a skill. But, a too high ledge that can be reached if the player makes his jump from a crate that he grabbed and moved there himself is a puzzle. The skills of jumping and grabbing and carrying and dropping are assumed. It is the combination of those skills that provides the puzzle.</P>

<P>Above, I've categorized the game skills in levels. These are not meant to be actual game levels (maps or zones) but varying degrees of difficulty. More advanced degrees of difficulty can be easily created by combining skills challenges to create a puzzle. For example, a simple puzzle might require the player to crouch while activating a switch that allows access to the next section of a map. Learning to crouch is very easy as is learning to look in all directions (to find the switch). Activating a switch with the Use Key is also a relatively simple task. The combination of those skills provides a simple puzzle, but a task that is admittedly more difficult than simply moving.</P>

<P>An example of a difficult puzzle might be one that requires many difficult skills. A special object might have to be thrown through a hanger window next to a vehicle. Then, the player must perform a running leap across a chasm to enter the hanger while shooting a switch trigger in mid air to ensure the hanger door will open when the player needs to land on solid ground. Then, the player must again lift the object and throw it into a complex vehicle like a helicopter which he must then operate and fly through enemy fire before reaching a pool of water that the object must be dumped into. The player might then be required to jump into the water and swim while carrying the object into the next area and so on. The object might be the head of an enemy general who's eyes are needed to pass a retinal scan locked door in an enemy compound. The goal of the puzzle might be stated for the player ("use the general's eyes to pass the retinal scan door"), but the difficulty in the puzzle is figuring out how to move the head from the area where you retrieve it to the area with the lock.</P>

<P>So, by compounding skills of varying difficulty Prax War can create endless possibilities for clever puzzling and unique challenges. The goal of the single player Prax War campaign is to provide an increasingly challenging and puzzling environment that offers plenty of reward and many areas and tests to increase skill.</P>

</ul><h1 id="1191" name="1191" class="book-h1">Immersive Level Design</h1><ul><p>Immersive Design-<br />
By: Kedhrin Gonzalez<br />
11/05/05</p>
<p>Introduction:<br />
	Immersive Design is the form of design level designers use to bring their levels to life.  Technology has been limiting us in the past from doing too much with immersive design until recently.  Now, levels need to be judged not just on design and art but immersion as well.  Immersion is a necessary element in levels, it makes the player feel like they are there in the game, living and breathing with the world around them.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some games that have done amazing jobs with Immersive Design in the past.</p>
<p>1.	Shenmue/Shenmue 2 – The Shenmue series is without a doubt the most immersive games ever made.  The player is thrown into a game world that is living and breathing, tricking the player into thinking it is working with or without them.<br />
2.	Call of Duty/Call of Duty 2 – The CoD series of games did an amazing job with Immersion.  The heat of combat left the player feeling as if they where actually struggling to survive.  CoD brought a realistic balance of high action with cool down periods, making the player not to be overwhelmed with the action to the point where they get numbed by it.<br />
3.	Doom 3/Quake 4 -  These games, using advanced technology visually brought the games to life.  The computers working around you, machinery going about their daily business without you.  The scenery so detailed that the player just put them into their head as realistic.  Like walking into a huge mechanical room, there would be so much detail the player wouldn’t be able to catch every single bit of detail consciously but their brain is still processing what is going on around them.<br />
4.	Half-Life/Half-Life 2 – The Half-Life series brought in a world to the player that made them feel as if they where a pawn in the game.  From small background things like the g-man being in areas where he shouldn’t be, to big blaring propaganda TV screens to struggling rebels fighting against the system around the player.  The level designers in the half-life series put forth the sense of a world torn apart.<br />
5.	Silent Hill Series – The Silent Hill games are known to be scary not for the jump moments like the Resident Evil games, but for the ambient effects in the game.  Silent Hill brought forth a horrific world with immersion techniques such as the scenery changing into a place the player would not want to go into, darkness with a flashlight and the cold, deathly silence of an empty deserted town.</p>
<p>This article is not to tell you how to do immersive design.  It is not made in the form of “I am correct”, this is simply my outlook on immersive design.  There is no right or wrong way into bringing your levels to life.  I hope this article is not looked upon from you, the reader as an instruction so much as it is my input.  You may take what you want from it, and you may disagree with what you wish.  Whatever you look at upon this article, you will learn from it in some way.</p>
<p>Magic! – The Masters of Illusion</p>
<p>Immersive design is a lot like magic to a certain extent.  When doing magic, you the magician know to create illusions with your surroundings and the tools you have available.  Immersive design is a lot like this.   We are creating an illusion of a world coming alive, a world breathing and thriving with or without life. </p>
<p>To understand this, we need to look into how the human brain works.  </p>
<p>When we go about our daily lives, we take in to our perspective of reality what we focus on.  What you focus on in your mind the brain processes and you can remember easier, you have your full attention to what you are looking at.  However, there are other things going on in the world beyond what you are focusing on that your brain is still processing yet you don’t actually consciously remember.<br />
Let’s take the situation of you being at a basketball game.  You are in the stands, with thousands of other screaming fans watching two teams play a game.  You are focusing on the players, primarily, you are focusing on where the ball is.<br />
Now, let’s take away all the fans except you and replace them with manikins.  Let us keep the sound of the roaring fans all around you.  You are there, but you lose touch, the feeling of being in a stadium full of roaring fans is not there so much.  Even though you are focusing all your might onto the game and the players playing the game, your brain is still processing what is going on around you.  Let’s take away the sound of the fans, now what do you have, you don’t really have a basketball game at all.  The audience is stiff as a board, and quiet as the forest, you are more watching a practice game done internally by the teams then a real game.</p>
<p>This is common sense, but it is often over looked by level designers both professionals and amateurs.  You have to serve the player a breathing world, down to the tiniest detail.  There is no such thing as unnecessary detail unless it is breaking your performance.  </p>
<p>Let’s create a room, a science laboratory for example.  We create our hollow cube for the room, place in some cabinets, some tables, some equipment, lighting.  Most level designers would say they are done and move to the next room.  The room is not complete until you walk in the room and are convinced it is real.  Graphically it does not matter, you can walk into a room that is 100 polygons in total and still make it feel realistic.  </p>
<p>Immersion is done a lot through sound, moving objects and things that will fit with the style of theme you are trying to do.</p>
<p>If you are working on a construction yard that is supposed to be a non-hostile area, you would fill it with construction workers, operating machinery, talking to each other and going about their every day chores of working in a construction yard.  The sounds of the machinery going off, breaking the dirt as they dig in, lifting metal, hammering, drilling, sawing and more goes on in this construction yard.  But the construction yard is not the only thing going on in the world.  What is going on beyond the construction yard?  The streets outside of it would have cars driving on it, the occasional person walking about.  The buildings would have lights on, windows open, watching tv and more.  The sky might have the occasional bird flying, clouds slowly drifting across the sky or planes flying around.   The world is filled with life every direction you look, it is your job to create the illusion that all of this is going on.</p>
<p>Let’s take for example however a horrific level, a quiet, desolate map that has no life in it that you want the player to be aware of until it is too late.  Your best reference for this is an abandoned building, before you ever try to attempt a horror style map, I recommend exploring an abandoned building by yourself both during the day and at night.  To some people, it is a very horrifying experience.   </p>
<p>Why is this?  The sound is so deathly quiet, that every time you hear a sound it scares you.  Visually, the buildings are filled with decay which the human brain in this time and day is not used to seeing so much (depending on where you live).  Rust and industrial designs do the most damage on the viewer’s mind, when we see something rusting up the brain knows it is not taken care of anymore and that no one cares for it.   Let’s say you are putting the player into a world filled with zombies, the player has gone into a mansion to look for someone.  How can you make this place scary?</p>
<p>If the mansion is new, and is not decaying, your elements of approach are the quietness and the stiff lifelessness the world will have.  You could click off the lights, but some say that is a bad game play element (I completely disagree however).  But let’s not do that, let’s say the lights where left on, some bizarre accident happened and everyone in the mansion is now a zombie, how are you going to pull it off?</p>
<p>Rule 1: No Music<br />
Music will destroy the feeling of a lifeless world.</p>
<p>Rule 2: Ambient Noise is your friend<br />
If the electricity is on, make sure the ambient noise is crazy, like how you would feel if you entered a deathly quiet house.  You’d hear the lights buzzing, the A/C turning on and more.  The sounds of the footsteps on the surfaces, wood creaking, doors closing and more that will make the player feel alone from friendly company.</p>
<p>Rule 3:<br />
Do you want a thriller? Or a psychological thriller?  For a thriller, you could have the player walking by a door and a zombie bust out.  Sure this will make the player jump, but the player is only scared because they don’t know when the next part they are going to jump to happens.  A psychological thriller, you will infect the players mind with so many disturbing images they will want to quit playing the game because their brain is so terrified they do not want to see what they are seeing.  If you are feeling really daring, you will go very far beyond every moral standard we have set for us.  That is your choice though, I recommend it but you did not hear it from me.  Have the player walking in a normal area, then they turn the corner and are slammed in the face with something so bizarre and unknown they will get scared.  The human brain fears the unknown, above all else.</p>
<p>So how do you go about creating these real life scenarios in a game?  Game tech only allows us to do so much, because of hardware limitations.  You need to look at things from this point of view, the player may walk outside only for a few minutes in a battle zone to escape to a helicopter, they may only be shooting the people in front of them.  Bad immersion design is to simply have explosions going off.  Where are these explosions coming from, where are the bullets coming from, if the player stopped for a second to look around, they’d see nothing.  Think of it to the sense of this, if the player stopped at any one moment in your level to look around and pay attention to what is going on, what will they see?  Will the world be alive, or will it be as static as a Lego built city.  Do not ever think that the player will never stop to pay attention.  Because chances are they won’t.  That is why there is immersive design. The things you create in your world, the player does not consciously recognize but the brain still processes. This brings the game one step closer to reality for the player.</p>
<p>Sound-</p>
<p>Sound is the most critical element in making an immersive environment.  When you walk into an office building, what kind of sounds do you hear?  This is where you take yourself, put yourself in a real life area and gather your references.  Computers make noises, vending machines make noises, etc.   There are still a lot of limitations on sound these days, but you can still put in enough to make the world a better place for your user.  Choose sounds that you think balance on the point of the player hearing/not hearing.  Because of our limitations in hardware, you have to be very picky with this.  You also have to be smart with it.  The sounds a computer make are not loud (usually) so the player should only hear them if they stop and are sitting right next to them and is very faint.   The player roaring past the computer blazing a gun, chances are they won’t hear it.  When the gunfire has stopped, and there is none left standing but you however, the player will be thrown back into the ambience of the world.  </p>
<p>Chose your sounds wisely, I would not choose sounds that there is probably no chance the player’s brain could ever even hear.   </p>
<p>Background Noise-</p>
<p>Polygon limitations have increased dramatically, especially with new shader technologies and more we are given the ability to make the world come to life with people walking where you can’t really get to them, etc.   This is also an area where you need be careful with what you chose.  If the player will never get to them, there is no point in making them high detail.  If they are far beyond reach and the player cannot get close to them (including a zoom) you can use a very low polygon character with minimal effects on them.  </p>
<p>The biggest thing you want to do with Background Noise is make the world feel like it is living and doing it’s own thing without the player, in other words, you are making a world – not a world for the player.   Consider every person you place in your map a real life person, what are they doing? How are they feeling?  What is their goal for today?</p>
<p>Do these things and the player will feel like they are in a living, breathing world.</p>
<p>Music-</p>
<p>Music is a very tricky immersion technique; I have seen it done poorly a lot of times.  When putting in music, you really have to think of the style of game play you are going for.  Music will influence how the player feels during a game, it will make them sneak, make them scared, make them fight faster, etc. You need to be very picky with the music you chose, if any music at all for your level.  Listen to the music you are putting into your level over and over, see if it really fits the mood of the map or not.  Some games have done horrible with music, playing the same song over and over throughout the entire game.  Avoid doing this as much as possible.   Some players identify their surroundings by music, so keep that in mind as well.</p>
<p>Also remember, that a lot of players turn off music, so make sure you make your level enjoyable with, or without music.</p>
<p>Lighting-<br />
Lighting is extremely critical, poor lighting is one of the primary reasons why so many maps are looked down upon.  Your lighting must fit the mood of the map or your map will fail.  Your lighting must also be clean at all times, there cannot be any errors.  If you have to spend 8 hours on a single room perfecting the lighting, that is what you’ll have to do to get yourself practicing good techniques to insure a total immersive environment.</p>
<p>Lighting sets moods of maps, you hear the saying “let’s set the mood” and dimming the light.  It is the same thing, darker lit areas usually go for scarier areas.  Bright lit areas are usually friendly.  However, lighting is different across all medians of themes for levels.  So just make sure you stick to the mood of your map.</p>
<p>Geometry Detail-</p>
<p>This is a very hard thing for some level designers, too much or too little detail.  If you have too much detail, the player will get numb to the surroundings and won’t be able to identify points of interest, which are critical to making maps.  Too little of detail makes maps look out dated and not really a good map at all.  You need to balance detail in your maps.  Detailed areas are great for interiors, destroyed areas, etc.  It all depends on the mood of your level.  Simple flat square rooms are usually never acceptable, as there is no detail at all besides the primary world brush.</p>
<p>What to do for a scene-</p>
<p>Let’s take a complete scratch example of a room with no design in it.  The level is dark corridors in an industrial yard, where a lot of action needs to be going on.  For this Immersion approach, say you built a big complex inside a building, full of pipes, fans, vents and other machinery.  This place needs to be either very noisy or very quiet.  If it is quiet, it needs to have the power shut off in most places to let the player know that everyone went home for the evening.  </p>
<p>Not every one of us has been in an industrial yard, so you need to tie the player into things they are familiar with industrial scenarios (unfortunately, what Hollywood has delivered to the player could be a good reference).  Take Nightmare on Elm Street or Terminator 2 for this example.  Glowing lights, machinery moving, hissing of steam, banging of chains, pipes, etc. all of these effects going on give a more alive environment.</p>
<p>The basic thing I see most level designers doing is creating a big room, putting in some lighting, animating a few fans and that is it.  Make the world feel more alive, make it look as it people are working there.  Leave a coffee mug on a machine flat top, leave a jacket on a stool, some papers on the ground, etc.</p>
<p>Keep in mind what you can do, to bring the player one step closer to believing they are there, remember it is always what the brain processes not what the player consciously recognizes is what brings immersion to the player.</p>
<p>My Techniques-</p>
<p>So, now that I’ve gone over a few topics in the area, I will describe to you my techniques.</p>
<p>Let me provide a simple example.  I am making a level, where you are with a gang of thugs and you are about to sneak into a complex to steal something.  The mood is modern Urban, nighttime and you need to sneak to get around.  The complex is heavily guarded with security guards carrying flashlights.  </p>
<p>This is key to designing your level, design every possible angle of fiction for you level before attempting this.  The complex is of nothing interesting, the security guards are just there for the extra dab of security so they are never really on high alert.  The complex is run by a rich guy who stores valuable goods in the complex.  The guy doesn’t have any enemies, and is friends with a lot of people so no one messes with him.  </p>
<p>The security guards are slackers, guys that never went anywhere in life so they had to get a job doing security, they like the job they have now because they play around and occasionally do their job ‘right’ because of their manager.  The complex has never had an instance of break-ins in the past.  </p>
<p>You and the thugs that are with you don’t know what is in the building, other than you know you want some.</p>
<p>How would I go about building this into an immersive environment-</p>
<p>From the beginning, I would not put the player at the entrance of the complex; instead I would make the player come up to the complex surroundings from the street.  Now, there will be no real danger of walking on the streets, the thugs with you will be walking normal.  In the streets, the buildings will have lights. A few people will be inside places, on porches talking and a few cars driving around.  I’ll do this with scripted events, I will script the cars to drive around at certain points where the player enters, I will sequence the talking of people as the player approaches.  As the player passes by an open window he will hear a TV playing in the building, but can’t actually see inside it.  </p>
<p>When the player approaches the complex, the thugs with the players will change their mood, they’ll begin to sneak and whisper.   The guards in the complex are standing around talking,  every now and then one will walk away joking, laughing really loud.  This will let the player know the guards are not serious about their job, making it easier for them to either sneak past them or take them out.  For a sneaky type area, I would make plenty of areas for the player and his gang to hide behind.  I would let the security guards path into areas where the player can get to them without causing too much noise.  During the whole time in the complex, the player will hear things going on outside of the area, cars driving, the sound of a busy city in the distance.  The guard stations will have a radios playing.  The player will be given the chance to sneak past guards who are idle chatting about the game they watched today, or something perverted they did the night before.  Anything you can do, to put across that the guards are slackers and don’t really care for their job.  </p>
<p>If a guard was to hear a noise, he’d go take a look, but he would not say the cheesy lines I hear in most games “Well, I guess it was nothing!”.  Seriously.  Give the player some more realistic dialogue, if you where a slacker guard and you heard something what would you do?  You would probably go check it out, nothing would be there and you would say something like “stupid cats” or something similar.  The guard would most likely start smoking a cig, rest his back against something and just sit there.  The slacker guard would not take all the energy to come check out what just happened, and then walk all the way back to his last position. </p>
<p>The player and his group of thugs make their way to the back door of the complex, try to get in but the door is locked.  You give the player the ability to break in or try to find a key.  Let’s make this interesting, let’s say the player decides to break in.  How will these slacker guards really react then when the alarms all of the sudden go off.  They will panic, be confused and all rush to get together, they will yell to one another instead of doing things ‘by the book’.  </p>
<p>Now, from most of the games I’ve edited, a lot of these things are completely possible through scripted events.  I have noted it to myself, and I recommend it to others to never rely on programmatic responses to the game world for your immersion feel.  The best I have ever seen this done was in Half-Life 2.  But the characters still felt as if they where lifeless. </p>
<p>Scripting your levels will be a lot of work, but scripting is what brings your level to life.  Depending on the engine you are using, you can setup random scripting events, in other words, setup your scripting system some how to be able to be random every time for replay ability.  I call these random chain events, you have a start, but it branches out like at tree, at every intersection there is a right and left, you randomize it so it is different every time.</p>
<p>The key thing you need to always keep in mind when making your immersive level, is to make the world work without the player.  This will take a lot of scripting, but with the right approach to the scripting setup you can save yourself a lot of time.</p>
<p>Immersion or not?-</p>
<p>Not every game you will edit will allow you to create these environments.  From horrifying decrypt abandoned buildings to medieval castles, the choice is up to you how you want your world to come alive.  You have to keep in mind at all times the things that go on beyond the players conscious thought is still processed in the brain.  The references you get are key to creating an immersive environment.  For fantasy and sci-fi fiction areas, your imagination in this area is critical.  </p>
<p>Design everything, design your level from the base fiction and up, go back 3 generations up the beginning of your level if you have to.  If you don’t believe in your level when you make it, no one will believe in your level when they play it.  Immersive design in the next generation of games will be the things the players will want.  They will want to feel the heat of battle, they will want to play in a thriving, living world.  If you are a professional, sometimes getting everything you need to create the most spectacular map will be difficult.  That is why I say do things on your own, if you can’t do sound – don’t set yourself to depend on others, learn it yourself.  If you can model, learn it.  Set yourself to be your own one man army for creating these levels.  When you have complete control over the creation process of your level, and you have the determination and innovation, you will have success.</p>
<p>But, you can also not do immersion at all, most of the levels I have seen done by amateurs have no immersion feel at all.  I’ll admit, I used to be in that batch as well.  Hopefully, those who do not think of these things will have a better insight of creating an immersive environment.</p>

</ul><h1 id="112" name="112" class="book-h1">Introduction to Lighting</h1><ul><p>It’s been said by many that lighting can make or break your level. It’s easy to see the difference between poorly- and well-lit rooms, as shown below.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="/content/tjb-intro-lighting/image1.jpg"><img src="/content/tjb-intro-lighting/image1-t.jpg" border="0" width="192" height="144"></a> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="/content/tjb-intro-lighting/image2.jpg"><img src="/content/tjb-intro-lighting/image2-t.jpg" border="0" width="192" height="144"></a></p>

<p>Having proper lighting works to serve two general purposes: it allows your players to recognize different areas of your map easier and also works to augment your theme/design. In some cases, lighting may also serve as a gameplay element. One good example of using lighting as a gameplay element can be seen in the mod Gloom by <a href=”http://www.planetquake.com/teamreaction/”>Team Reaction</a>.  While the human bases in the maps tend to be well lit, the spider bases are dimly lit to give each team the upper hand on their turf.</p>

<p>Although in classic lighting theory, lighting tends to be grouped into three main categories, key lighting, fill lighting, and back lighting – in game design we’re principally concerned with key and fill lighting. Key lighting makes your maps more dramatic and visually intriguing; fill lighting softens up the key lighting and makes your lighting appear richer and feel “fuller.” </p>

<shot of key lighting> <shot of fill lighting> <shot of both combined>

<p>Depending on the game engine you’re working with, you’ll probably have the choice between point lights (also referred to as omni lights), spotlights, and texture lights. For key lighting you’ll want to use mainly point lights and spotlights since they tend offer a greater degree of control. Fill lighting can be done with any type of light and tends to be dimmer than key lighting.</p>

<p>When you’re using colored lighting, try to keep your bright colors to your key lighting – otherwise you risk over saturating a room with color. Make sure you soften up the color by using off-whites for your fill lighting. This will make the color feel more natural when viewed with the rest of the room.</p>

<p>By using different types of off-whites for your fill lighting, you can adversely affect the mood of your map. Using a greenish off-white, for example, produces an effect similar to the kind seen in the Matrix movies, while a bluish off-white can make your room appear cooler. Take some time to experiment with this .</p>

<green room> <blue room>

<p>It’s important for all of your lights to have realistic sources, especially your key lights. Nothing breaks the surrealism of a good level design faster than seeing a nice brightly colored light in the middle of a room with no apparent source. In the real world, when we see light we know it has to come from some place – and your players will have the same expectation when they play through your level.</p>
 
<p>Unfortunately, good lighting generally isn’t something you can get right on the first try – sometimes lighting can take the most amount of time during the development phase of your map. Even after you get fairly decent at laying out initial lighting, usually you’ll spend plenty of time tweaking things to get them to look just right. Depending on what engine you’re mapping for and how fast it takes to compile the lightmaps (unless lighting is done in real time), tweaking can be a time-consuming process.</p></ul><h1 id="1124" name="1124" class="book-h1">Level Design Process</h1><ul><h3>LEVEL DESIGN PROCESS</h3>
by Yan "Method" Ostretsov
<p>

<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">INTRO</div>
<p>
I decided to write an article/tutorial about a level design process. In this article,
I’ll cover things like planning, sketching, blocking out, naming, building and adding
details to the level. As an example, I’ll be using sketches and screenshots from my
Doom 3 CTF map, entitled Central Hub (methctf1).
<p>

<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">PLANNING</div>
<p>
When I decided to start a new map, I was looking for an idea. The armor room in Station M (my previous map) was a perfect place for a flag room. I figured gritty underground station connected with hubs and lifts will make a good CTF map. 
<p>
If it’s possible, I try to get the reference of things I build. Movies, books and online images
are great material for reference.
<p>
There was a problem with the texture choice, because I couldn’t find many dark textures.
Most of them were metallic and had a shiny surface, thus making the map look like a regular Doom 3 map.
The solution was to use dirty decals on top of brushes, to dim the shininess and blend in shiny textures
with the surrounding environment.
<p>
To support the textures, I picked the light color that reflects them. So for a dark brown wall texture with
gray ceiling and red corners in some places, I picked a brown/blue color for the lighting. Color theory comes in handy when it’s
time to pick the colors for the map. The main light in Central Hub is brown (warm color), which is inviting
to the player. Few areas have blue and gray lighting (cold colors), which are darker and give the player a
chance to sneak around those areas or for a FC (Flag Carrier) to hide, while his flag is being returned.
A few small orange lights highlight dark areas and work as an accent to the main lighting.
<p>
It's always a plus if a map has some kind of a gimmick. Something that players will remember it for. When I was
sketching gameplay ideas for Central Hub, I came up with a circular room that has pipes surrounding it's middle and
connecting two hallways which lead to the flag room. I thought it would be a good place for a FC to rocketjump
on pipes and hide there, while his flag is being returned. From the top view in the level editor it looked like
some kind of a hub. I named the level after that area. Later I added vents, which served as pipe supports
and had steam comming out of them. I placed blue light in the hub to create a dark and chilly atmosphere. Since I was
building a CTF map and bases were identical, I called the hub areas - Blue and Red Hubs.
<p>

<p>
<i>Blue Hub (beta version)</i>
</center>
<p>

<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">SKETCHING</div>
<p>
I tend to sketch gameplay ideas or parts of the level before building them in the editor.
It’s always a good idea to make a few rough sketches, because it takes less time than actually
building it and it’s very easy to fix or make changes on a paper. Planning and sketching can help
you to see and predict the problems that may arise later in the design process, which will take
a long time to fix or even result into starting a whole level from scratch. Another thing to remember
is that a level always changes throughout the design process and that not all things that look good
on the paper will look good in 3D. Only a few things that I sketch make it to the final version.
Some rooms change 2–4 times before I decide to keep them.
<p>
For Central Hub, I sketched a few gameplay ideas, different parts of the level and main areas such as
flag rooms and team hubs.

<p>

<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">BLOCKING OUT</div>
<p>
Once I’m finished with planning and sketching, I begin blocking out the level in the editor.
Blocking out means to roughly block out map areas, add temporary lights and early item placement.
It’s really important to see if what you planned on a paper looks good in 3D and to check the scale
before adding textures and details.
<p>
Here is an example of blocked out level:

<p>
<i>The CG (Chaingun) room</i>
<p>
<i>Note: I used 'textures/base_wall/reactorwalla3a2' texture to block out Central Hub.</i>
</center>
<p>

<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">NAMING</div>
<p>
It’s not necessary to name a level right away. In fact, I usually name levels in the middle of their development.
Good names are always catchy and easy to remember. To find a name for a map, I usually think of a phrase to describe
a level, level’s gimmick or some main area.
<p>
I had a hard time coming up with the name for Central Hub. The level has several lifts, which enable the player
to do a bunch of trickjumps, so I was looking at names with movement. The player jumps, bounces and moves through
the level, just like a quake. I looked for a phrase similar to quake and came up with the Seismic Movement. I liked it at first,
but later realized that it would be hard to remember. I continued with the design of Central Hub, until I begun to build an
octagon-shaped area with pipes circling it. It connected two hallways just like a hub connects wires on a network.
I was thinking that the central area of the map is the main hub, thus coming up with Central Hub as a name for my map.
<p>

<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">BUILDING</div>
<p>
There are two methods for building the level. The first is to work on one room at a time, add permanent lights,
textures and details. The second is to work on a whole level in layers. So if I was using the second method,
I would add basic textures to the whole level, then add permanent lights, then details and so on.
<p>
Most LDs get tired of working on one room at a time and if they are building the map as a hobby and not for
a game studio, they might not finish the level. When I get tired of working on the same room for a long time,
I move to another room and work on something different.
<p>
For Central Hub, I used combination of those methods. I worked on a level in layers at first and then
individually on each room.

<i>Added permanent light and details (Alpha version)</i>
</center>
<p>

<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">DETAILS</div>
<p>
Details are what separate good levels from great levels. Sometimes it’s hard to come up with what kind
of detail to add to the map, but the answers are in the reference or even in the map itself.
Level areas should have something that stands out, something like an accent,
a detail that catches player’s attention.
<p>
I try to add details that are realistic, but sometimes visuals are more important than
reality.

</center>
<p>

<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">TESTING</div>
<p>
Always test your maps before releasing them to the public. Make sure that players won't get stuck, there's no
z-fighting (two or more brushes sharing the same coordinates) and no vis problems. Release beta versions of your maps
for testing and feedback, before releasing the final version.
<p>
Since Central Hub is a map for CTF, feedback was really important to me. I got some feedback on alpha version, to make
sure that I'm on the right track, before continuing with the map.
<p>

<p>
by Yan "Method" Ostretsov 
<p>
<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">INTRO</div>
<p>
Dan Koppel, Lead Designer of Gray Matter, once said that planning is one of the most important things in designing a level. Planning helps with performance, gameplay, etc. It also helps to find and prevent mistakes that can occur in the future. Since planning is such an important part, I decided to write a tutorial fully dedicated to that stage. 
<p>

<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">IDEA</div>
<p>
One of the first things is to come up with an idea. What the level will be like? What kind of interesting gameplay idea can you implement? You can have a visual image of a room or some kind of atmopshere you're trying to recreate. Since most of my tutorials are based on MP (Multiplayer) levels, this time I'll go with SP (Single player). When working on SP maps, LD (Level Designer) has more freedom. He can have narrow hallways, small ledges and a lot more detail than in MP maps. It's really important to have one or two interesting areas. Something that players will remember the level for. I'll be using Chicago 1930's as an example in this tutorial. 
<p>
Just thinking about Chicago, I can come up with several interesting areas: 
<p>
- Street surrounded by skyscrapers<br>
- Dock with a big bridge in the background<br>
- Dark Train station<br>
- Factory with industrial chimneys<br>
- Gritty back alley<br>
<p>
Those are some rough ideas. Since I'm planning a realistic environment, it's wise to look up some reference pictures. 
<p>

<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">REFERENCE</div>
<p>
Next step is to research the era. What's Chicago 1930's like? Most of the buildings are blocky and have dark textures. Good texture choice for the level would be brown, gray, blue colored textures. Something that will reflect that dark and moody great depression era. 
<p>
You can find good reference online, using Google or Corbis site. For Chicago reference I used Library of Congress site, which has thousands of old Chicago pictures. Also watching some movies always helps. 
<p>
Now that I have some reference, I can study the pictures and extract useful information. For example these are the details I found on the reference photos that can drastically increase the visuals of the level: 
<p>
- Electric Cables<br>
- Antennas and rooftop detail<br>
- Hotel and Bar signs<br>
- Billboards and window ads<br>
- Pipes supported by the buildings<br>
- Building trims/ledges<br>
- AC placed outside the window<br>
- Building and sewer grates<br>
- Hydrant on the sidewalk
<p>
At this stage, you should roughly know what kind of level you're building. Next step is sketching the level. 
<p>

<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">SKETCHING</div>
<p>
I prefer to use grid paper when sketching top down view layouts. For detail or quick perspective drawings I use printer paper.

<h3>Design</h3> 

The author of this article, <b>Gary 'Kol' Brigadir</b>, worked with the Issues team and continues to produce maps for Half-Life that are inspiring.<br><br>
 There are already a few tutorials here at RUST that look at good design and this is not meant to replace that information, but to enhance it.<br><br>
These Tips & Tricks come from reading all there is to read and testing and re-testing theories.  (<i>As well as having actually released something into the public domain :-)</i><br><br>
<hr noshade color="black">
<!--break-->


<h3>Generic Single Player Mapping tips.</h3>
This is a list of guidelines for making single player levels. Hopefully you'll find this useful. Some of the guidelines are based on theory, so if you have any experience you want to share, or have different views on anything mentioned here, or have anything to add, please post a comment!<br> Remember, these are guidelines & tips, not rules on how to make maps.<br><br>
There is <b>one rule</b> to single player maps: <b>FUN</b>! Everything else is up to you.<br><br>
Physical Level design can be broken down to 2 basic parts:<br>
<dir>
<b>Environment</b> -  (which is largely brushwork, textures, ambiance, architecture, props...)<br>
<b>Gameplay</b> -  (entity work, story telling, progression, pace, interaction...)<br>
</dir>
<h3>1. Environment:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Good interesting Architecture is derived from functional environments: real life or fictional. Try to mimic real-life environments as opposed to just creating places to shoot things in. </li><br><br>
	<li>Architecture and props often fit environment style and sometimes characters, monsters & weapons. Some Items are designed for use in different environments: So no sniper weapons in Vents Please! </li><br><br>
	<li>Architecture also adapts to physical, natural, human, and gravitational constraints - supports, brackets, beams - what you might call detail. Make it look like its there for a reason. </li><br><br>
		<li>Brushwork and Architecture also serves a purpose - it subtly hinders or aids the player by giving enemies better cover or giving the player certain advantages. </li><br><br>
	<li>Good brushwork and architecture always conforms to Game Engine limitations. </li><br><br>
	<li>Artistic, & Surreal factors play a role in constructing less "real-life" environments. You can draw inspiration from anything, Movies, Other Games, Books, and even Dreams. </li><br><br>
	<li>Mechanical locomotion helps an environment "feel" more interesting. Try to spend as much time on creating gameplay elements as you do on environments. This includes everything the player can interact with. </li><br><br>
	<li>Uniformity is limited to certain types of architecture, so try to keep away from "corridor maps" Variety is always good. 
   </li><br><br>
	<li>Try to create the impression that every room or prop or item serves (or served or will serve or would serve) a function. 
</li><br><br>
	<li>Loops are very effective: Let the player see areas where they were, or will be, or have to be. This also includes backtracking – a little backtracking can save you mapping new areas, but too much and it gets boring and annoying. 
</li><br><br>
	<li>Convey feelings of awe, fear etc through spatial awareness - high places, wide, large, small, dark. Lighting plays an enormous part in spatial awareness, so take time to tweak your environments until you are happy with the feelings conveyed. 
</li><br><br>
	<li>The less obvious errors in texture alignment, brushwork, and style the better. Don’t put dirty, rusty barrels in a clean lab, and don’t have clean walls and floors in places where there could be obvious ware & tare. 
 </li><br><br>
	<li>Attempt to tell a story through the environment – how did it become destroyed for example, why is it so clean and lifeless? What happened, and what will happen? If you can master this, then making your gameplay elements becomes a lot easier.</li><br><br>
	<li>Take time to perfect the ambiance of an area, use every single enhancement you have available: Ambient sounds, sound / echo modifiers etc...</li><br><br>
	<li>Try to put emphasis on <b>Purpose</b>, <b>Function</b> and <b>Gameplay</b> enhancement. </li><br><br>
	</ul> 
<h3>2. Gameplay</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A little "skill based" (jumping etc) gameplay is good, too much and it gets frustrating. </li><br><br>
	<li>Rewards and risks should be balanced and obvious. </li><br><br>
	<li>Try to create the impression that you can be attacked from all sides at any time. Tension is a must in any map, but this has to be balanced too, since players soon grow immune to it if it is overused.</li><br><br>
	<li>Try to strike a balance between huge fire fights, periods of relative "calm" and puzzle solving. </li><br><br>
	<li>During fire fights make things interesting with multi-sided battles, but keep it efficient. Know all the enemy types and what makes them tick. An example from Half-Life: <br><dir>
<i>4 grunts and 3 aliens can be more effective than having 12 or more monsters eating away at your r_speeds. The key is in knowing what works and what doesn’t.</i></dir></li><br><br>
	<li>Relative calm means exploring areas, occasionally encountering enemies or other characters. It can also help build up tension and offer a change in pace. Room for exploration and finding alternative routes to goals reduces linearity in maps. </li><br><br>
	<li>Avoid things like difficult jumps, cryptic puzzles, design faults, and hugely imbalanced gameplay where the player resorts to cheats by play testing your maps thoroughly. </li><br><br>
	<li>Make it FUN: Whatever is fun to you, is probably fun for a few other people, ask others what they think.  Comic relief never hurt any map. Be it eye candy, freak accidents, gratuitous violence and or character one-liners. What makes a map fun is up to you in the end, but a good level is a fun level, after all, this is why we play games... </li><br><br>
	<li>What players expect to see is far more frightening than anything you can show them. Use this to your advantage – delay revealing “scary” monsters or similar things to exploit the player’s imagination. Offer clues before revealing something big and instrumental.</li><br><br>
	<li>Again, gameplay is about Fun. If it’s not enjoyable, it’s not worth playing. </li>
</ul> 
<h3>General tips / guidelines:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>If you want to progress in your mapping ability, getting the right kind of feedback is key. In progress there is just one factor involved, and its experience. You get experience from mapping. In feedback, you need a balance of encouraging feedback, and constructive criticism. </li><br><br>
	<li>Remember: When criticising its imperative that you keep this balance, <i>be nice to the mapper, verbally beat the map</i>. </li><br><br>
	<li>If you feel like mapping, map - it makes no difference what you're working on, just map what you want. Practice is experience.</li><br><br>
	<li>Releasing a Map to the Public? Great, but first make sure you have everything done. All maps released to the public must be fully and properly tested and assembled. There’s nothing worse than getting a map and finding out that the author didn’t even bother including all the files needed to run the thing... </li><br><br>
	<li>Needless to say, any map what has obvious errors and bugs in the design should not be released. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Testing:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Fix on the go: Run around your map and jot down any oddities, errors and bugs you find on paper somewhere and fix them immediately. You may overlook a bug early in the design process, forget it, and never hear about it until someone tells you that they can't complete your map because of it. 
It’s a good idea to let someone you don't know test your maps. Get a second opinion on your design and take the criticism seriously and constructively. </li><br><br>
	<li>Evaluate the criticism according to your judgement, and then act on it. Don’t change something just because someone said it was crap. Think first. </li><br><br>
	<li>When testing maps always test to breaking point - try to interrupt important sequences that must happen, jump where you’re not supposed to, try to ruin the map when testing it. If you and or your beta tester(s) fail to make the game crash or create serious errors in the map or gameplay then the map is ready for release. </li>
</ul>
 <h4>Assembly:</h4><ul>
	<li>[Half-Life Specific] Make any SP release its own mod folder with correct directory structures and all necessary files.</li><br><br>
	<li>There's nothing more annoying than getting a map, loading it up, and having the game crash because the author forgot to include a sound, model or something else. </li><br><br>
	<li>Always include a ReadMe with information you think is relevant to the release. </li><br><br>
	<li>Avoid self-installing scripts or programs. A lot of people, like me, hate them. You should be able to unzip / unrar / untar.gz and fire up the custom game or map without worrying that the installer will overwrite any of your existing files. </li><br><br>
	<li>When distributing your maps through the internet make sure everything is the way it should be, remove unused files and directories, double check that you have included all the content, and when your map is uploaded somewhere, check that the zip file is not corrupted and everything is intact. Yes, that’s right, ZIP or RAR or TAR.GZ, do something. Lots of people are still on 56k. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>There are lots of Articles and tutorials covering gameplay and general level design. You don’t have to go far to find them. Just search around, read material you find useful, and know that wisdom is something that cannot be passed on through IRC, forums or word of mouth. If you want to discover something, do it your self to get the maximum benefit.</p>
<p>Make levels for fun, not because you want appreciation from the community or fame on the Internet. That gets you nowhere.</p>
<p>Once you gather enough insight into the secrets of level design, mapping gets harder and harder, as standards of work increase. If you can fend off the difficulty and keep the fun factor in mapping then you’ve got what it takes to do this kind of thing professionally.</p>

<B>By weasl</B>
    
<H3>What does it take to make a great DM level?</H3>

Energy, conflict, creativity, flow, and design are all words that come to mind when I think of a great DM level. But how do you combine these words, and your ideas into a final product that totally kicks ass? Hopefully by the time you’ve finished reading this you will not only be able to recognize and apply these in your level, but make them second nature. 

<H3>The Plan</H3>

First off you need a plan. I don’t mean a diagram of it on graph paper (but this could be good), but a mental image of what the level is going to look like, and what texture selections you are going to use. An example of this would be deciding to build a base like level using the tech textures. Although this may seem a very basic part of the over all structure of your level, it is one of the most important ones. Stick to a certain group of textures and try not to mix and match. Make the textures fit the mood you want to convey in your level, not just some slapped on wallpaper. 

<H3>Structure, and Flow</H3>
<p>
Your next step should be to set up the structure of the level, and starting to think about the flow of your level. 
</P>
<P>
The flow of your level is the paths that a player is most likely to take, as influenced by architecture, design, teleporters, and weapon placement.
</P>
<P>
Now comes into play the conflict portion. Design your level so that these paths intersect at key points. Look for these intersections and plan your level accordingly. Without these players will wander aimlessly around trying to find each other! Make sure that players can get around a level quickly, don’t make them hike from place to place, use teleporters, or centralize certain areas. It’s best to think of your level as a series of boxes (not literally!) interconnect them with hallways, and vary their sizes. Each of these so-called boxes is a battleground (a place were 2 or more players can have a pitched battle). Player’s will use the "hallways" to travel from area to area. All though the concept may sound confusing, if you take the time, and look at some other really good levels, you will understand the theory. Don’t worry its even harder to apply, then to understand. Try to keep this in mind as you set up your level.</P>

<h3>Architecture</h3>

Once you’ve gotten the very basic layout done, its time to start on you architecture. A lot goes on in this stage, and most of it you need to learn for your self. My only suggestions are to become familiar with your level editor, and look at lots of other levels for inspiration. Don't make your level boring to look at. Quake has a great 3D engine, use it to its fullest. Also try not to make your level repetitive. This can be the downfall of it. Imbed a little bit of chaos into your work, it will keep players from getting bored, and keep them on their toes.

<H3>Weapons and Armor Placement</H3>

Remember what a said about conflict? Good. Now apply it. Place weapons accordingly. I break them down into two categories. Low-power, (super shotgun, nailgun, and super nailgun) and high-power (rocket launcher, lightning gun, and grenade launcher). The low powers are ok, to have near spawn points, but try to keep the high power ones, a little bit further away. Also try to space out the high power weapons. Make sure not to bunch them up and neglect one half of the level. Remember that hight power weapons will be the ones that players will be after, thus expect conflict in these areas. Another good way to control the use of weapons is by ammo placement. If you keep the RL at one end, and the nearest box of rockets at the other… You now have that RL player on your paths back to the ammo. Which of course brings him back to the conflict. Armor should be placed with Green Armor in easy to reach places, red armor tucked away, and yellow can go either way. Try to keep players on their toes, don’t stick an RL next to a RA, but give the RA to that guy with the SNG. This will intensify your conflicts, and prevent camping. Place an amount of items in proportion to the estimated number of players that will be playing. Power ups should be in out of the way places. Never place them at the center of a conflict! Powerups are there own catalyst, and will build a conflict of their own. Realize this! Instead of sticking it out were everyone could get at it, tuck that quad away in a corner somewhere. The battles for it will be some of the most vicious ones, and its especially fun when there is little space to maneuver. One fun trick is to place powerups in places where the player has some chance of dieing; a tricky jump over lava to get the Pentagram, or a slime bath to get after that quad. This makes powerup placement seem more well thought out, and enhances the fun factor of the level. 

<H3>Spawn Points, and Traps</H3>

Now I’m going to discuss spawn points. Keep them spaced out and low-level weapons around them (no one likes hunting with a SG, but give em an SSG, and they’ll be out looking for fresh meat). Also keep spawn points out of key battle areas; no one likes being spawn killed. When you set your spawn points remember that Quake will spawn you in the order that the points are placed. I suggest that you go out of your way to place spawn points in such a way that sequential points are as far away from each other as possible. Place the first spawn point, then place the second spawn point as far away as from point one as possible, and so on. Traps are something that you should think hard about. In a single player level they are alot more appropriate then in your typical DM level. Most players feel cheated when they are killed by a trap, and in a DM level it can be even worse. My suggestion is this: If your going to make traps make them player activated (like the squishier in DM2.) 

<h3>The Beta Test</H3>

Ah the all mighty beta tests. This is probably one of the most over looked aspect of DM level creation. Yet, it is probably one of the most important things to do to insure that your level is a true piece of art. Get some friends together, and let them point out areas that will be abused, and places where they feel vulnerable from lack of weapons/armor/ammo. If you get the chance to test it out in QW, follow around the person that’s winning; find out what they’re doing, and what type of advantage it gives them. One or two simple weapon and ammo placements can totally alter the way a level is played, from making a level way to unbalanced to the perfect frag fest.
<BR><BR>
Throughout this all just remember that this is supposed to be FUN!

<H3>Release It!</H3>

Unless you want your perfectly crafted level to rot on your hard drive till the end of time, you need to release it! Put it up on cdrom.com, and tell the major level review pages about it.
<BR><BR>
Hope this was helpful to you!

<p>
by Yan "Method" Ostretsov
<p>

<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">INTRO</div>
<p>
I always listen to music while designing maps. Gritty beats by Cypress Hill and  industrial sounds by Nine Inch Nails
is my choice of music. One day I was listening to  Mash-Up Radio, a show hosted by DJ Muggs of Cypress Hill, and I got an idea.
If  there are promotional levels for graphics card like NVIDIA, why can't there be one for a  radio? After thinking it over,
I contacted Muggs and told him my idea to make a promo level for his radio. He liked the idea and I begun working on a level
which later be  known as Mash-Up Streets (methtourney1).
<p>

<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">PLANNING</div>
<p>
I knew that to make a promotional level for a radio would be quite a task, because  players hate any kind of ads in games.
The best way to go about it, was to use a non  Quake 4 theme for a level. Something like a futuristic city with billboards,
that would  blend in together and won't bother the players.
<p>
I had to show the idea to Mash-Up Radio's producer and since I didn't have a scanner near by, I made a few quick sketches
in PhotoShop:
<p>

<p>
<img src = "http://www.gamedesign.net/content/method/mashup_idea2.jpg">
<p>
<i>Very early sketch of RG area</i>
</center>
<p>
Now that I had an idea for the level, it was time to look up the reference. I'm fascinated by  Chicago 1930's architecture,
so I decided to look through my Chicago photo collection. 
<p>
<div style = "color:#333333;font-weight:bold">TIP: Make a reference folder on your computer and save any interesting pictures you come across online.
Soon you'll have a little library, which you can use to look up ideas for  future levels.</div>
<p>
I also looked through several architectural magazines for ideas. In fact, the first room  (RA area) I built,
was inspired by one of photos I saw in those magazines. It wasn't the  45 degree building, but the placement
of the hallway leading to SG (Shotgun) compared to  the billboard building. Something simple and sort of
irrelevant can spark the ideas.
<p>
I came up with the name early in the design process. Since I was building a Chicago city  with futuristic elements,
I decided to call it Mash-Up Streets, because it mashes two styles together.
<p>

<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">SKETCHING</div>
<p>
My original idea for the level was that I'll have a big radio tower, supported by one story building in the middle of the map.
That building will have an accel pad, which  will push the player to the roofs of surrounding buildings. So basically the fights
will  be on the rooftops. Building ledges will be used to travel from one roof to another. After testing that out it felt too
jammed to move. So I decided to free up the place and  use a different layout, more suited for Quake movement.
<p>
<div style = "color:#333333;font-weight:bold">TIP: Grid paper is great for sketching top down view layouts of levels.</div>
<p>

<p>

<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">BLOCKING OUT</div>
<p>
Since Quake 4 was shipping with modified D3Radiant and it would be really simple to port map geometry from D3Radiant
to Q4Radiant, I decided to use Doom Edit to block out my map ideas, while waiting for Quake 4 to be released.
<p>
<center>

<p>

<p>

<p>
<div style = "color:#333333;font-weight:bold">TIP: When blocking out a level, try to stick to one texture. That way you won't be
distracted by the visuals and concentrate on gameplay more precise.</div>
<p>
Once I got Quake 4, I decided to use a similar texture to block out the level, but the ambient light in Q4 won't
separate the shapes. So I ended up making a gray texture with  black outline, so it will show off the edges.

<p>

<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">APPLYING TEXTURES</div>
<p>
I spent some time looking through various Quake 4 textures. They were good, but very few could go with the theme
I chose to design. I went through several stages before I got to the texture choice I was happy with.

<p>

<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">BUILDING</div>
<p>
A lot of work went into building Mash-Up Streets. I went through the same design stages as I go
every time, which are:
<p>
- Blocking level out with temporary lights<br>
- Applying basic texture set<br>
- Tweaking lights and adding more textures<br>
- Adding detail and tweaking geometry<br>
- Beta and pre-final testing of the level<br>
- Polishing the level<br>
<p>
I want to go over several things that have been changed after receiving some feedback.
<p>
<div style = "color:#333333;font-weight:bold">TIP: Always test your maps before releasing them. Sometimes when LD (Level Designer) is so concentrated on the whole level,
it's really hard to notice little mistakes.</div>
<p>
Originally the central tower had only lower entrance. After showing early beta to a few Treyarch designers, one of them suggested to open the tower up.
That really added to the level, because it created an upper ground, which can be used to overlook the surrounding area. Adding a powerup on the upper level
created a valuable, yet dangerous spot.
<p>
One of the early changes was LG (Lightning gun) hallway, which added a way for the defeated player
to gain control of the level by picking up some armor shards and sneaking to RG room.
<p>
Another thing that has been changed was the RA room. In the beginning it was quiet small and it became a trap room. While watching several good players,
I noticed that they timed RA well and right before picking it up, spammed the hallways to stop their opponent from acquiring it. Enlarging that area and
creating an additional window in RG (Railgun) room fixed the problem by having more space to move in.
<p>
Since the beginning, I was planning the ledges/trims of the buildings. I thought it would be a great idea to jump from one ledge to another.
After testing the level, I was told that those ledges create sniper spots, which really slow down the gameplay. Adding a clip brush and blocking some ledges,
made it into a real fast-paced level.
<p>
There were two suggestions, that really affected the visuals of the level. One of the
suggestions was to add cables, which will add to the visuals and break up the sky.
Another was to create some buildings that could be seen in the distance to make the environment appear bigger.
<p>
<div style = "color:#333333;font-weight:bold">TIP: Make an illusion that there's more to the environment you created by adding background details. Something like buildings in the
distance that could be seen through the windows.</div>
<p>
Item placement is really important in tourney levels. In fact, it can make or break a level. I've learned that item placement/gameplay is more important than visuals
in competitive maps. If I was a stranger and saw that Mash-Up Streets has RG and RA (two of the most important items) in the same room, I would say that it's some bad
item placement. Yet that item placement makes perfect sense and is very balanced. One of the most important things I learned from designing Mash-Up Streets is competitive
item placement. It takes so much time and logic to make it play well in all situations. Just knowing what makes good item placement is not enough. Testing is really
invaluable.
<p>
Most if not all players commented that the promo stuff wasn't right in their face and it felt like it was a part of the map. I accomplished that by placing a billboard
next to the RG room and on the central skyscraper. Even though the billboard is very exposed in RG area, it doesn't stand out much. Usually players will be too concentrated
on the game and won't notice it more than once or twice. The second billboard was placed high on one of the central skyscrapers, so the player will notice it only when
looking way up.

<div style = "background-color:darkgray;font-weight:bold">LOGIC</div>
<p>
Several people said that they would like to see more of how and why I plan this or that. So I decided to introduce a new section for this article,
which I called Logic. In this section, I'll go over my logic of design using RA area as an example.
<p>
Here's visual logic explanation for RA area:
<p>
<center>
<img src = "http://www.gamedesign.net/content/method/mashup_logic1.jpg">
<p>
<i>Reference for the visual logic section</i>
</center>
<p>
1. The 45 degree building was one of the first things that I blocked out. It went through a lot of changes. Since early block out stages, I added windows
to create an illusion of an urban building. To make it even more realistic, I placed a metallic texture behind some windows, which created an illusion
of blinders. To polish it up, I placed a patch with flare texture set to low opacity to create that light glow from the window, without sacrificing
FPS (Frames Per Second) by actually placing a light entity. 
<p>
The 45 degree cut is pushed in and since it looks like a core of the building, I decided to use dark textures to highlight that.
The lower windows of the core have a different design than the top ones, to break the repetition. They're more spaced out, which gives them weight
to visually pull down the lower part to the ground level. The upper windows on the other hand are longer, which makes the building seem taller. 
<p>
2. Originally, the ground level was flat, but by pushing it down it created more space and interesting geometry to that area, along with breaking the floor
up for better light calculations. Most if not all Q4 steps have a width of 16 units but since I had a clip brush covering the steps, they created a strafe jump,
which would make the player fly up and bump his head on one of the wall supports. To fix that I changed step width to 32 units and spaced them a little, to
tilt the slope created by the clip brush, so it pushed the player forward instead of upwards.
<p>
To break up the ground level for light calculation, I added a tile beneath the RA. Then I placed some dirty decals to make the area less clean.
<p>
3. Wall supports serve two purposes. The main purpose is that it's used as a shortcut for players to jump from RA jumppad to the RG room. The second purpose
is that it adds to the visuals by connecting the buildings. It also adds a little bit of blue color to the light brown/gray ambient light.
Since light brown is a warm color, having a cooler color like blue adds to the atmosphere.
<p>
4. To add more detail to the RA area, I decided to place some chimneys and antennas on the rooftops. I looked at the sky texture to figure out where the sun at.
Then I placed a light entity next to the chimneys and pulled out the center of origin. I played with its position to make sure that the sun shines from the correct angle.
If the sun was behind the details, then I would try to highlight the chimneys without making it too unrealistic.
<p>
5. When picking out the sky texture, I wanted to have something moody. Since most of the building textures I used were dark, I thought that reflected light brown light would
really add to the colors and create a moody atmosphere. Then I added a few cables to break up
the sky and add to the visuals.
<p>
Here's gameplay logic explanation for RA area:
<p>
<center>
<img src = "http://www.gamedesign.net/content/method/mashup_logic2.jpg">
<p>
<i>Reference for the gameplay logic section</i>
</center>
<p>
1. Ground level is the main route in RA room. It's fairly wide to evade the rockets and other projectiles, yet at the same time it's very dangerous, because a player can be
spammed with rockets from above. He can strafe jump through that section without any problems and even make a crouch slide against the steps. Major
weakness of this path is
that the player won't know if it's a trap or not, until he's at the RA.
<p>
2. RG path on the other hand is narrow, but since it's on the higher level it gives the player more advantage. It's possible to jump or run on wall supports, then get
RG and go through either of entry points. RG route also has the most choices. Player can decide to use the upper ground or jump down. It's also possible to look out
of RG window, which faces the RA to see if an opponent camping the item.
<p>
3. Since RA is one of the most important items, there will be a lot of fights in that area. To balance out the
RA corner, I placed two ramps. One which leads to the RG
and the other which leads to the health shards. The second ramp can also be used to slope jump on the
wall support. Players with really good movement skills can actually over jump the
wall support. 
<p>
<div style = "color:#333333;font-weight:bold">TIP: Adding trickjumps to the maps opens new movement possibilities and adds to the fun factor. It also
  separates new players from experienced and gives
them something to learn.</div>
<p>
Hopefully this was enough to show how and why I plan things the way I do.
