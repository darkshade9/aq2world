<b>Rust: </b> First of all, tell us a little about yourself and how you made it to Electronic Arts.
<br><br>
<b>Alex: </b>My career path has been a long and windy one.  One could say that I’ve had a rather diverse work history.  Prior to getting into the gaming business, I was employed in a number of different fields.  Among the positions I’ve held, I worked for AT&T, United Airlines, and a five-year tour of duty for the Bakersfield Police Department.  For various reasons, I chose not to make any of these jobs my life long career.  Through it all though, playing games was one of my biggest hobbies.
<br><br>
I had gone back to school to pursue a degree in computer science when career and hobby finally collided.  A wonderful little game called DOOM came out, and from that moment on my fate was pretty much decided.  I became a level design junkie, and eventually school was forgotten and my every waking hour was spent in front of the level editor.  Fortunately, my life was spared when Xatrix Entertainment asked me to come to work for them, thus preventing my wife from murdering me in some grisly fashion.  We packed up and moved to Los Angeles, were I would spend the next few years as the lead designer at Xatrix.  It was during this time that we shipped Redneck Rampage, Redneck Rampage Rides Again, Redneck Huntin’, Quake II Mission Pack #1: The Reckoning, and finally Kingpin.
<br><br>
After my work on Kingpin was completed, I decided that it was time to move on from Xatrix and expand my horizons.  It was around this time that I was approached by Electronic Arts and was invited to join the Bond team.  After a couple of meetings with EA, it was obvious that this was a good fit for me, and I agreed to join them.  My wife and I packed up again, and here we are now in Northern California.
<br><br>
 
<b>Rust: </b> What are the differences between making a map for The World is Not Enough and previous 1st person shooters?
<br><br>
<b>Alex: </b>I would say that the biggest difference is the fact that we’re working with a licensed property... the best for that matter.  Obviously, the world of James Bond is very well defined, with a long and celebrated history.  To ensure that we remain true to the well-established license, there are certain processes and creative boundaries we must respect and adhere to.  Although this necessitates a greater degree of structure and planning than an original concept might require, the reward of bringing the Bond universe to life easily makes up for this. 
<br><br> 

 

<b>Rust: </b> Because you’ve licensed the Quake 3 engine, I assume that you are using Q3Radiant as well.  What kinds of modifications have been made to the level editor, and will it be released with the game?
<br><br> 
<b>Alex: </b>We have a programmer dedicated solely to improving the functionality of Radiant, so we are definitely making some heavy modifications to the editor.  This, in conjunction with major changes to the editor made by Robert Duffy at id Software, as well as modifications made by the guys at Ritual and Rogue, has gone a long way to giving us a more robust tool.  There are far too many things for me to list though, so I’ll just provide a few samples of items that have either already been added, or that we are currently working on:
<ul>
<li> Multiple cameras for improved navigation
<li> Improved mouse navigation in the 3D window
<li> Multiple face selection, as well as easy cycling through individual brush faces
<li> User defined brush groupings with hierarchical relationships
<li> Improved filtering
<li> Surface based material properties
<li> Lighting Preview
</ul>
<br><br>
At this point, we’ve made no official decision as to whether or not we will release the editor with the game.  It is my assumption that we’ll want to do so, but before we can make that determination we’ll first need to check what our responsibilities are in regards to our licensing agreements.  We should have a better idea of this at a later date.
<br><br> 

<b>Rust: </b> Describe your design process, from the general idea of the map to the finished product.  Do you draw the map out first, or just fire up the editor?  Does only one-person work on a map, or does it get passed around?
<br><br>
<b>Alex: </b>Since this product follows the plot of the recently released movie, this is where the bulk of our design has been derived.  Mission ideas have been based off of key plot points from the film, and highly defined documents have been created that illustrate the layout of the levels, as well as the activities that will take place within them.  Once these designs have made it through the approval process, level designers then begin creating the environments and implementing the gameplay.  Supporting each level designer is a dedicated texture artist and programmer.  Typically, the level designer will stay with the level until its completion, although in some cases we do pass them around if the need arises.
<br><br>
 
<b>Rust: </b>  What are the biggest challenges for you in making maps in general, or specifically for The World is Not Enough?
<br><br>
<b>Alex: </b>The biggest challenge in trying to turn a film like TWINE into an interactive experience is filling in the gaps that the movie leaves behind.  Films present their stories from a controlled perspective, only showing the audience what they feel is necessary or desired.  This means that in many cases, two walls and a floor is all that the audience ever sees, and nothing exists beyond that particular set.  In a first person POV game though, the player has a full range of movement, which requires us to interpolate from the film and create what the camera in the movie never shows.  It’s a unique challenge, and one that when successfully met creates an interesting juxtaposition between the movie and the game.
<br><br>
 

<b>Rust: </b> What do you think players will be the most impressed with in The World is Not Enough in terms of level design?  
<br><br>
<b>Alex: </b>In terms of level design, I think that players will be most impressed with our attention to detail.  The fact that this game is based on a movie makes attention to detail especially important, as I believe it’s necessary for us to try to stay as true to the film as possible.  To accomplish this, we’ve put together a team of level designers that I consider one of the best in the industry, whose talents and skills are unparalleled.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b> Because The World is Not Enough is being developed for the PC and the Playstation 2, are there any special considerations you have to take in to account?  Will the levels in the PC version be very different from those in the PS2 version?
<br><br> 
<b>Alex: </b>Although both platforms are utilizing the same design, the differences in hardware are significant enough that we’ll certainly have to make some adjustments.  Specifically, the Playstation 2 has more limitations when it comes to system memory and video RAM, not to mention the lower resolution of the average NTSC television screen.  On the other hand, the Playstation 2 can process an incredible amount of polygons.  Both platforms have their strengths and weaknesses, and we’ll be sure to tailor each version accordingly.  While both products will share certain elements, the nature of the hardware will mandate that the experiences presented are not necessarily the same.</body></html>
