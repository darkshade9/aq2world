<b>Rust: </b>Howdy Bobby, for the few people who don't know tell us who you are, what you do, what your working on, and whatever the hell else you would like all these rabid fans to know about you? ;)
<br><br>
<b>Bobby: </b>My name is Bobby Pavlock (aka Xcalibur).  I am a level designer at Ion Storm, currently working on Daikatana, trying to finish it up and make it as badass as possible :)
<br><br>
<b>Rust: </b>Besides getting paid, what are the lesser known advantages of full-time, in-house, game design?
 <br><br>
<b>Bobby: </b>Well, the biggest thing for me is just actually having the time to devote to making cool stuff.  I used to have all kinds of things that would eat up all my time, like college (yuck!), and I could never get enough spare time to do some of the really cool stuff I always wanted to.  Then, of course, there is the convenience of having a texture artist at your disposal any time you need a cool new texture, and programmers for when you need a cool new feature coded.
<br><br>
<b>Rust: </b>What would you consider the most difficult aspect of level design?
<br><br>
<b>Bobby: </b>I would say the most difficult aspect of level design, for me, is the planning stages - trying to come up with something fresh and new, that has never been done before.  There are SO many levels, both professional and user-made nowadays, that almost everything has been thought of by now, that is, that can be done with the technology available at this point.
<br><br>
<b>Rust: </b>what's the easiest?
<br><br>
<b>Bobby: </b>The actual building of a level is rather simple, especially the architecture.  It's just a matter of knowing how to use an editor.
<br><br>
<b>Rust: </b>What kind of machine do you create your levels on, and what editor do you use?
<br><br>
<b>Bobby: </b>Before I came to ION, I was trying to edit Quake2 levels on a WinChip 200 (some off-brand pentium wanna-be chip) that runs about the equivalent of a 166, with no 3D card either.  When I got here, they had a P2 450 waiting for me.  Slight difference :P  We are using IONRadiant,a modified version of QERadiant.  And, yes, it will be included in the game. 
<br><br>
<b>Rust: </b>When planning a level, do you outline it out on paper first, or start in the editor?
<br><br>
<b>Bobby: </b>I do both actually, it just depends.  I usually come up with the look I want for the level in my head just by thinking about it and using some imagination.  Sometimes I get a clear picture of how everything is going to look, and how it's going to be laid out, and I just dive right in.  Other times, I get a feel for what I want it to look like, but don't know exactly how I want the layout to be, or what exactly I want to happen as you progress through the level, so I do some very loose sketches to kind of give me a feel for what the layout should be. 
<br><br>
<b>Rust: </b>How is Daikatana editing compared with other Quake/Quake2 engine based games? Any new functionality?
<br><br>
<b>Bobby: </b>Well, it is based on the Q2 engine, so it is very similar.  It has alot of the same basic entities used in Q2 editing.  Some of the cool new stuff we have is effects like fog, rain, snow, lightning, rotating trains, moveable glass and midtextures, parent targeting (so you can attach a button directly onto an elevator or lift and it travels with it), entities with sound flags built-in eliminating the need for 1000 target_speakers, etc.  There's alot more, but I can't divulge everything :)
<br><br>
<b>Rust: </b>How often do you compile and playtest your level being made?
<br><br>
<b>Bobby: </b>
I make extensive use of the region utility in Radiant, and do several region compiles a day, checking to make sure everything is looking and working the way it should be.  The maps in Daikatana are so huge, that even with the mammoth compile machines we have, it still takes a while.  So I usually will do a full compile of the entire map only once every few days, usually after I have added alot of new stuff.
<br><br>
<b>Rust: </b>What would you suggest to someone who is wanting to be a professional designer some day?
<br><br>
<b>Bobby: </b>My advice, for what it's worth, would be to spend your time making a map as badass as humanly possible, making sure to have something out of the ordinary that will catch people's eyes.  When you have added everything you can possibly think of to make it as cool as possible, then go on to another one. It is better to have a few awesome maps, rather than several decent ones.  Quality is definitely better than quantity.
<br><br>
<b>Rust: </b>What other games are you looking forward to in the future?
<br><br>
<b>Bobby: </b>There are several games coming out this year that look impressive.  "<a href="http://www.DawnOfDarkness.com/" target="_top">Dawn of Darkness</a>", a Quake 2 TC by <a href="http://www.wardsix.com/" target="_top">Ward Six</a>, is looking awesome for a great single player experience.  For multiplayer, Quake 3 and TF2 should be awesome.  And of course, Daikatana, Anachronox, and Deus Ex. :)  
<br><br>
<b>Rust: </b>Any closing comments?
<br><br>
<b>Bobby: </b>Just can't wait for Daikatana to get done so I can make people "Suck it down" in some Daikatana DM. :)  Thanks for the interview Shane. Keep on rockin' with Rust!</body></html>
