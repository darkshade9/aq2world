<b>Rust: </b>whats your best or favorite way to begin a map?
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>I just start laying brushes around...however, I usually have a pretty clear vision of what kind of a map I want. The Crucible was an exception, though :) So I just start creating rooms, adding details as I go, scrapping, resizing and so on.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b> To follow this up, about how long do you spend on a level? average hours & weeks.
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>When I'm on the roll, I can sit behind the screen 24hrs a day, and sometimes I don't feel like to touch the damned editor for weeks. It really depends. I usually spend a month or so until I'm really confident this is the map (read: layout, lighting, item placement, flow) I can release without later regretting my move :)
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b> I see that the key to the overall style and design of your maps is detailing. Duh. But more specifically, there's rarely a surface that's left long-and-flat, or static. What kinda of time do you spend on these details? How many different versions of these details do you go thru before you decide "I like this one"?
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>I can't answer straight to that question, since every detail goes through various phases before it gets its final form. Sometimes 2-3 versions, sometimes...god knows how many... :)
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b> Arghrad has a lot of features that most mappers don't use. Lately, you've used a lot of cascading light which not only looks BAD as HELL. . . (translated: really nice) but bounces in nice ways to actively light the surrounding area. Do you consider lighting and using Arghrad's extended features, like focusing surface lights, critical to the overall effect?
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>Not critical, all the neat lighting effects can be created without using Aghrad as well. However, Argh provides easy ways to create such effects without messing with targeted entities and ambient lighting. The lighting itself is a critical part for creating an atmosphere...just load up Headshot's Wasted and run around. Beautiful, eh? Now turn on the fullbright lighting ("r_fullbright 1" from console) and see...not as impressive anymore. You can literally make bread out of shit with proper usage of lights... ztn2dm3 - The Rage would be a good example ;)
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>How are you on 'prefabs'? I'm not talkin about structures that you'd getfrom the Prefab Park. I mean things that you've created for yourself that you use from map to map. Your item-markers are pretty signature (IMO).
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>The only prefabs I use are weapon pads...I have only 4 of them: base style red and blue, and waste style red'n'blue.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>I see you use a different texture theme each time...base, installation, waste, etc. . . Whats your favorite or best texture set?
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>Hmm...though question...probably Iikkabase textures for Q1 (Painkiller) and the "Upper mines" set (The Crucible).
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>How difficult of a time do you have with leaks and the "miscellaneous" type errors? Has any of this ever resulted in redesign, overhaul, or even replacement of an entire area?
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>Sometimes. HOM is pain in the ass when it occurs, and usually I'm forced to redesign that area. As for other errors...there are several ways to nail down leaks, so that's not a problem...I'd have to say that I've been lucky when it comes to having nasty errors :)
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>As a closer, what SPECIFICALLY could you recommend... NOT to the newbie, but to the average mapper? You know. . . the guy (like me) that's released generally AVERAGE work?
<br><br>
<b>Sten: </b>Uh, um...try to make every next map in some way better than the previous one. But there's this thing I'd like to recommend to *every* mapper out there:  don't make maps just for getting "famous." And I'm dead serious about that, it'll lead you nowhere.</body></html>
