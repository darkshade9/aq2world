<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Allows you to add custom buttons to your MOD
</p>

<hr noshade color="black">
<!--break-->
<h3>Step 1: open file input.cpp</h3>

<p>
you need to first create a variable, typically global to the file which is a "kbutton_t"
</p>

<p>
you'll find a lot of these declared at once in input.cpp, 
so add something like:
</p>

<font color="red"><pre>
kbutton_t in_my_new_button;
</pre></font>

<p>
Or whatever you want to call it :p</p>
</p>

<h3>Step 2: Specify the Command you want to use</h3>

<p>Each button has a command, e.g. attack has +attack as a console command</p>

<p>
You need to create a command in console from it as well, you can do this by using pfnAddCommand()
</p>

<p>
Although first you need to make a function which just makes the key down or up (pressed or released)
</p>

<p>
So you need to make TWO functions and TWO pfnAddCommand statements. Have a look...
</p>

<font color="red"><pre>
// pressed button
void IN_My_New_Button_Down(void)
{
      KeyDown( &in_my_new_button );
}

// released button
void IN_My_New_Button_Up(void)
{
      KeyUp( &in_my_new_button );
}
</pre></font>

<p>
There is also a place in input.cpp where a lot of pfnAddCommand()'s are made. Add your commands there.
</p>

<p>
you need to specify the command you want it to be and the name of the function which deals with it that you just made above. For example:
</p>

<font color="red"><pre>
      gEngfuncs.pfnAddCommand ("+my_button", IN_My_New_Button_Down);
      gEngfuncs.pfnAddCommand ("-my_button", IN_My_New_Button_Up);
</pre></font>

<p>
remember your button whatever you want.
</p>

<h3>Step 3: Giving the button an ID</h3>
 
<p>
Each button has a cont=stant identification to know what buttons are pressed. e.g. Attack has the constant IN_ATTACK, we want to make our own.
</p>
<p>
Now you should make a new bit for your button that will work with 'pev->button' in entvars.
</p>

<p>
Define it in input.h, as follows:
</p>

<font color="red"><pre>
#define IN_MY_NEW_BUTTON (1<<16)
</pre></font>

<h3>Step 4: Check if button is pressed</h3>
 
<p>
That's your new button's bit mask set that you can check in game if it is pressed.
</p>

<p>
Now you've done that you can go down into the CL_ButtonBits() function. Like this:
</p>

<font color="red"><pre>
int CL_ButtonBits( int bResetState )
</pre></font>

<p>
Add some new code to add your new bitmask to the bits pressed when your button in_my_new_button's state is 3 (i Think!)
</p>

<p>
Here is an example:
</p>

<font color="red"><pre>
      if ( in_my_new_button.state & 3 )
      {
            bits |= IN_MY_NEW_BUTTON;
      }
</pre></font>

<h3>Step 5: Resetting the button State</h3>

<p>
You also have to add the button when your resetting the state at the bottom of the function.. where it has all of this stuff..
</p>

<font color="red"><pre>
      if ( bResetState )
      {
            in_attack.state &= ~2;
            in_duck.state &= ~2;
               ...
               ...
        }
</pre></font>

<p>
so now just add..
</p>

<font color="red"><pre>
in_my_new_button.state &= ~2;
</pre></font>


<h3>Finished</h3>

<p>
That's it. You have just codified your first button in Half-life. Congratulation!!!
