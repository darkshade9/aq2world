<b>BIOGRAPHY</b><br><br>

<b><i> - Description</b></i>:<br> I am old by most game design standards which has it's advantages and disadvantages.<br><br>

<!--break-->

Prior to HL I was involved in a project to convert DooM monster sprites into 'Local Identities' to give us something to do on nightshift.  I started using WordCraft 2.1 in '99 or so when I discovered it on the HL CD. First major triumph was a room with a prefab metal shelf that I could bang a crowbar on, how cool is that!! I was hooked.<br><br>

I will be the first to admit that my work isn't all that brilliant and this is where the transition began. I moved into adding content to TWHL in 2002.<br><br> 

Answering questions and keeping things moving by providing tutorials on demand. I employed the test, re-test theory to all the questions I answered and was inspired by <a href="http://http://home.att.net/~firebinder/home.htm"> FireBinder's Test Chamber</a>. The more time I spent researching questions, the less time I spent on serious HL mapping.<br><br> 

There were brief interludes to create a few DoD 3.1 maps and a CS map. The CS map was created to see what all the fuss was about, I mean, after all... how hard could it be?<br><br> 

Bloody difficult was the reality. I ended up reading all of Dave J's design notes and finally rebuilt the whole map.<br><br>

The serious mapping pretty much ended there, I realised that I didn't have enough talent to produce quality map's and I decided to utilise my talents guiding and coaching those that had more talent, but didn't understand how to get their dreams to come alive.<br>

 Currently working on an HL1 SP based modification (GTLS) that I think will take 6 or 7 years. As you can tell from the Screen Shot above... It has a long way to go!<br>
