<b>Rust: </b>Who are you and what do you do?
<br><Br>
<b>Paradox: </b>Hi, I'm Tom.  I do levels.  I do gameplay.  I do it all.  Oh yeah.
<br><Br>

<b>Rust: </b>Besides getting paid, what are the lesser known advantages of full-time, in-house, game design?
<br><Br>
<b>Paradox: </b>Being able to do what you love for a living.  After shooting high in the current world of career's and realizing what kind of REALLY boring jobs are out there, this is a  dream come true.  Not to mention free drinks, cool hardware, working with badass people and all the other little things.
<br><Br>

<b>Rust: </b>How closely to you work with the art team?  How much input do you have on the look of certain units (texture sets, item/creature skins, etc?)
<br><Br>
<b>Paradox: </b>We all work very closely here, everybody has input on what goes in the game, how things look, and how things play.  I try to keep my  hands on most of the aspects in the game, although most of my non level-design time is spent working on level continuity related issues, gameplay, and design ideas.
<br><Br>

<b>Rust: </b>How about the programmers? Do you have any significant input on how specific entities will function?
<br><Br>
<b>Paradox: </b>Like I said before, we all work really close.  I would think that the level designer/programmer communication is definitely some of the most active in the communication lines.  We are constantly in there asking for new stuff to be implemented and old stuff to be fixed or changed.  Its one of the many changing things around here, everything from the tools that make the levels, to the implementation of entities in the world.<BR>Always movin.
<br><Br>

<b>Rust: </b>What is the biggest difference, from a level designers perspective, between a mission pack/add-on and fully licensed engine?
<br><Br>
<b>Paradox: </b>Mission packs are more of a copying job than a originality thing.  A new game is completely yours from day one. Despite the coolness of the mission packs, your working with somebody else's vision, so its not as much of a original feeling in the end.  It feels a lot cooler and more inspiring to work on your own stuff.  
<br><Br>

<b>Rust: </b>Compared to Quake2, how much more control can amateur editors expect when they get their grubby little mice on the Sin tools?
<br><Br>
<b>Paradox: </b>Well, Sin is going to ship with SinED, which runs both in NT and 95.  Plus, the amount of control that we have given to people is incredible.  The level/entity scripting language allows for _COMPLETE_ control of everything in the game, and is setup in just a text file.  This allows for the us as well as the end user to create something, compile the map once, and tweak the entities until they are right without having to recompile.  Not to mention the new character system, no more having to write out scriptfiles for characters in order to get them to step correctly.  With Sin, you just export it directly to the game and there ya go, new monster.  Plus, each characters actions are determined and defined by how they are exported automatically by the game, so you can literally create a new weapon/monster without having to write any custom code, just animate the dude and off you go.  This doesn't mean that you Can't write custom stuff for the characters, it just makes it easier to do stuff and get it in there without looking borked from step one.  Needless to say, we have gone out of our way to make sure that Sin was setup in ways that were much more efficient and less time consuming that it was to do other projects, and by doing that, we have inadvertently created a incredibly easy game to add on to.  whew.
<br><Br>

<b>Rust: </b>How much steeper will the learning curve be?
<br><Br>
<b>Paradox: </b>Not much steeper than normal.  Each time a new game comes out, there is more to learn of course.  Sin will be really easy for most people I would think.  We have made efforts to take out all the extra complex and overly time consuming steps.
<br><Br>

<b>Rust: </b>Will the scripting be incorporated into map editing, or is it just for the modelers and coders to play with?
<br><Br
<b>Paradox: </b>The scripting language was developed specifically for entity control, and game logic in the maps, but it has grown to encompass other parts of the game.
<br><Br>

<b>Rust: </b>Have you had a chance to look at/play any of the user-created levels?
<br><Br>
<b>Paradox: </b>I had a period of time where I looked at user created levels a lot.  I haven't as much recently, but I love looking at what people are doing.  Its incredible to see what somebody coming from a completely different angle can end up doing with these games.  I have seen some really wacky stuff done with our mission pack entities, stuff I just didn't think was possible.
<br><Br>

<b>Rust: </b>From what you've seen, what are some of the more common mistakes?
<br><Br>
<b>Paradox: </b>The most common mistake I see in levels is people trying to make it look cool and skipping over the most important thing, the flow. First make the level gameplay and flow work, then, go back and make it look cool.
<br><Br>

<b>Rust: </b>When creating a level, which aspect is the most time consuming for you?
<br><Br>
<b>Paradox: </b>Well, its kind of a tossup.  The fleshing out stages, and the tweaking both take a long time.  When fleshing out a level,  trying to figure out what goes past this room and where this door will go, takes me a while.  It usually goes a lot faster when I draw out the level on paper.  With tweaking, trying to get an area down to the right FPS, or better r_speeds, that can take forever as well.
<br><Br>

<b>Rust: </b>Which comes easiest?
<br><Br>
<b>Paradox: </b>Making the stuff that goes in each area.  Its easy to fill a room full of cool stuff, its the flow and the tweaking thats the hardest to get down.
<br><Br>

<b>Rust: </b>On the average, how long does it take for you to build one map for Sin, from the first brush to the final compile?
<br><Br>
<b>Paradox: </b>Its averaged to about one month.  With tweaking, mabye add a week each map.  A little more than double the average map making time for Scourge.  Triple from Doom.  
<br><Br>

<b>Rust: </b>Do you ever feel that a map is really 'finished?'
<br><Br>
<b>Paradox: </b>Nope, never.  All of my maps from day one have things that I could go back and make better.
<br><Br>

<b>Rust: </b>Before we're finished, any words of wisdom?
<br><Br>
<b>Paradox: </b>Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals, I'm living proof.  beefcake! BEEFCAKE!
<br><Br>

<b>Rust: </b>Any words of outright lunacy?
<br><Br>
<b>Paradox: </b>Good.  Bad.  I'm the guy with the gun.
<br><Br>

<b>Rust: </b>Any questions you want to ask yourself?  (I may have missed some important stuff.)
<br><Br>
<b>Paradox: </b>Q: What do I do with my freetime  A: Spend lots of time with my badass Girlfriend, Stevie &quot;KillCreeky&quot; Case.
<br><br>
Q: Current Favorite/Least favorite movies A: Favorites are still Titanic and now The big lebowski. Least favorite, Dark Flippin wasted my damned 7 bucks City.
<br><Br>

<b>Rust: </b>Well then, I think that's about it.  Thanks a lot Paradox!
<br><Br>
<b>Paradox: </b>No prob, anytime.  I guess I should start updating my plan again..hmmm</body></html>
