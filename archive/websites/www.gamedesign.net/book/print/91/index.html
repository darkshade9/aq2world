<b>Rust:</b> First of all, tell us a little bit about yourself and your position at Digital Extremes.
<br><br>
<b>Mike:</b> I've been on the Level Design team at DE now for just over a year and a half.  Along with building levels, I tend to like working with the 'latest stuff'.  As a result I'm ususally the one working with the programmers to iron out the new features for the editor and such.  Also, with the latest offerings of Warfare and all the cool stuff our programmers have been implementing, it's been a sweet challenge coming up with new ideas and uses for all of the tech.
<br><br>
 
<b>Rust:</b> Has working as a professional in the gaming industry changed your views of gaming at all?
<br><br>
<b>Mike:</b> Not really.
<br><br> 

<b>Rust:</b> What do you feel is the most important part of level design?
<br><br> 
<b>Mike:</b> For me it would be the visuals and the depth of the atmosphere.  One thing I felt lacking in some of the earlier multi-player games was the ambience.  Items that were normally only found in single-player games, were for the most part omitted.  Things like ambient sounds, creatures, particles, etc., should all be part of any gaming experience.  I think UC will make a large step towards a more interactive environment.
<br><br> 

<b>Rust:</b> What limitations do you feel hurt you the most when designing game levels?
<br><br>
<b>Mike:</b> Numbers.  Whether it be in the time department, the poly sector, or texture thrashing... they're all pain.  Time is something it takes a lot more of now to design, lay-out, model, play through, place & tweak particles and effects in any one level.  Polys are now on a higher budget, but even given this, it doesn't take very long to over spend there.  Then with texture support climbing well beyond the usual 256 * 256, it can also quickly eat up your memory.  Finally, all of the additional elements like particles, sounds, dynamic lights and players, rapidly erode your level plans.
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> As professionals in the industry, what is the most common mistake you see in amateur maps?  What’s a common mistake you see other professionals make?
<br><br>
<b>Mike:</b> I don't play too many amateur maps, but even those I do, I honestly don't see too many glaring mistakes.  The communities have come to the point where all of the tutorials, forums, reviews and advice columns have come together and made it easy for a beginner or novice, to avoid many of the pitfalls or problems associated with amateur map making a couple years ago.  The same holds true for the most part on the professional end of things.
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> When it comes down to pre-planning your levels, what do you do?
<br><br>
<b>Mike:</b> Lately I've been doing some more sketches before hopping right into the level.  I'll talk to a couple of the other LD's and then to a couple of our modellers for their ideas and input.  I will sometimes sketch out a few of the fixtures or models myself as well.
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> What first sparked your interested in becoming a level designer in the game industry?
<br><br> 
<b>Mike:</b> The notion of doing what I loved and being paid for it.
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> What were you doing before you worked at Digital Extremes? What do you envision yourself doing after your stint at Digital Extremes?
<br><br>
<b>Mike:</b> I was assembling aircraft before DE.  I'm a 'DE-lifer', there can be no existence after DE... :p
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> While you’re not designing games, what are you doing in your spare time?
<br><br>
<b>Mike:</b> Well I just came back from an excellent camping and fishing trip.  In the past I was into skydiving and some rock climbing.  More recently I've been mountain biking, hiking and reading.
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> What sources do you use for inspiration? 
<br><br>
<b>Mike:</b> Things I see daily or cool places I've visited, movies, books, art work and other games.  Sometimes I'll have weird dreams and draw ideas from them too.
