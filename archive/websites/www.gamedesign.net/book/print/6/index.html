<h3>How do I create a proximity door (a door that stays open as long as the player
    remains in a certain area near the door)?</h3>
    
 <p>You've most likely seen the doors in the Half-Life single-player campaign
    that opened only as long as you turned a wheel, but which started to close
    after you let go of the wheel. Remember the underwater grates in "Surface
    Tension"? Those are the type of doors I am referring to. They are <I>momentary_door</I> 
    entities, and the controlling wheel is a <I>momentary_rot_button</I> entity.</P>
      
 <p>The <I>momentary_rot_button</I> entity, though, has an interesting property.
    Repeatedly triggering the entity has the exact same effect as if you hold
    down the +use key while standing near it! We will use this property to activate
    our proximity door.</P>
    
 <p>Creating a proximity door requires the use of three entities:
    <ul type="square">
        <LI><I><B>momentary_door</B></I>, for the door itself;
	    <LI><I><B>momentary_rot_button</B></I>, to control the up and down motion of
	        the door; and
	    <LI><I><B>trigger_multiple</B></I>, to define the proximity area and repeatedly
	        trigger the <I>momentary_rot_button</I> in order to keep the door open
    </ul>
    </P>
    
 <p>We will discuss each entity in turn.</P>

<hr noshade color="black">

<h3>Step 1: Creating the <I>momentary_door</I> entity</h3>

 <p>If you are in any way familiar with creating normal <I>func_door</I> entities,
    then this will be easy for you to understand. Create your door in the usual
    way, except that instead of making it a <I>func_door</I>, make it into a
    <I>momentary_door</I>. Set the door's angle, speed, lip, etc., to the values
    you want.</P>
    
 <p>Now we need to give the door a name, so that we can use a
    <I>momentary_rot_button</I> to activate it. The example map uses the name
    <CODE>proxim_door</CODE>.</P>
    
 <p>Finally, we want the <I>momentary_door</I> to close automatically once we
    stop triggering the <I>momentary_rot_button</I>. To do this, set the door's
    <CODE>spawnflags</CODE> value to <CODE>32</CODE>. (In Worldcraft, this means
    to check only the "Toggle" spawnflag). Enabling this spawnflag allows the
    door to close automatically once the <I>momentary_rot_button</I> stops activating
    it.</P>

<h3>Step 2: Creating the <I>momentary_rot_button</I> entity</h3>

 <p>If you've created a <I>func_rot_button</I> entity before, then this will
    be easy, too. Create your rotating button as usual (complete with origin
    brush!), but turn it instead into a <I>momentary_rot_button</I> entity. Set
    its speed, auto-return speed (<CODE>returnspeed</CODE>), and rotation distance
    (<CODE>distance</CODE>) as desired.</P>

 <p>For this tutorial, since the player doesn't have to +use the button to activate
    it, the button does not have to be set up in a visible part of the level.
    Since the <I>momentary_rot_button</I> entity is brush-based, it can even be
    placed in the "void" outside of the map. The <A href="http://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.gamedesign.net/content/half-life/tutorials/proxdoor/proxdoor.zip?PHPSESSID=8f8c8174f2f6310c13434ca0722e94a6">example map</A> 
    places the button in full view of the player so that you can see that the button 
    turns when triggered repeatedly.</P>
    
 <p>Now, set the <CODE>target</CODE> key (WC: "Targetted object") to the name
    of your <I>momentary_door</I>. The example map sets it to
    <CODE>proxim_door</CODE>. This allows the button to open and shut the door.</P>
    
 <p>Now, set the spawnflags of the <I>momentary_rot_button</I>. The base value
    that you need to enter in the <CODE>spawnflags</CODE> key is <CODE>18</CODE>.
    (In WC, this is equivalent to checking only the "Not useable" and "Auto Return"
    spawnflags). Enabling Auto Return allows the door to close itself automatically
    once the button is no longer being activated. Add 64 to this value (WC: check
    "X Axis") if the button rotates around the X-axis, or 128 to this value (WC:
    check "Y Axis") if the button rotates around the Y-axis.</P>
    
 <p>Finally, give the button a name, so that we can activate it via triggers.
    The example map uses the name <CODE>proxim_btn</CODE>.</P>

<hr noshade color="black">

<h3>Step 3: Creating the <I>trigger_multiple</I> entity</h3>

 <p>This is the most straightforward step, provided that you have created triggers
    before. Create a brush to define your proximity area and cover it in the
    AAATRIGGER texture. Then select it and turn it into a <I>trigger_multiple</I>
    entity.</P>
    
 <p>Set the trigger's <CODE>target</CODE> key (WC: "Target") to the name of the
    <I>momentary_rot_button</I>. (For the example map, this is
    <CODE>proxim_btn</CODE>.)</P>
    
 <p>Then set the trigger's <CODE>delay</CODE> key (WC: "Delay before reset")
    to <CODE>0.1</CODE>. This causes the trigger to fire every tenth of a second
    while the player remains in the trigger area [unless you enable the "No Clients"
    (2) spawnflag -- see below]. Since the trigger targets the button, which
    in turn controls the door, the door will open and stay open as long as the
    player remains in the trigger area.</P>
    
 <p>The different spawnflags of the <I>trigger_multiple</I> allow you to customize
    which beings in the map get to use the proximity door:
    <UL type="square">
	    <LI>"Monsters" (1): If this spawnflag is enabled, then any monster which wanders
	        into the trigger area will activate the door.
	    <LI>"No Clients" (2): If this spawnflag is enabled, then the player cannot activate
	        the trigger. He/she would need to turn the button manually. If the button
	        is hidden from the player, then the door is off-limits to him/her. Too bad.
	    <LI>"Pushables" (4): If this spawnflag is enabled, then pushing a pushable object
	        into the trigger area will activate the door and cause it to stay open.
    </UL>
    </P>

<h3>Step 4: Compile and run</h3>

 <p>Compile and run your map. The door should begin to open when the player steps
    into the trigger area, and should stay open as long as he/she stays in the
    trigger area.</p>

 <P>I've created a small example map that illustrates the concept. The first
    door you come to is a normal sliding <I>func_door</I> -- ignore this one.
    The second door is the proximity door. There is a wheel along the wall here
    -- this is the <I>momentary_rot_button</I> that controls the door. I decided
    not to hide it so that you can see the button rotate when it is triggered,
    and to allow you to +use the wheel yourself to open the door. The proximity
    area for the door is the area covered in the red and white stripes.
