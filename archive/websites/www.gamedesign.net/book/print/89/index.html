<b>Rust: </b>What kind of improvements/enhancements can we expect in future versions of QERadiant/Q3Radiant?
<br><br>
<b>Robert: </b>The biggest things will be full undo/redo (as opposed to the hacky crap in there now) and some sort of heiarchial group management. I'm looking into lighting preview as well as some different ways to use the camera too. New texturing method of operation, and expanded plugin support/capabilities.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Are there any plans for sin or heretic 2 support in the future?
<br><br>
<b>Robert: </b>No on Sin, maybe on Heretic 2. I like both games, well actually I LOVE Heretic 2 but have just not had time to sit down and go through the requirements for editing.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Will Q3Radiant be included on the Q3:Arena CD when it ships?
<br><br>
<b>Robert: </b>I think there is a good possibility but it is really up to the folks at Id.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>When can we expect a new release?
<br><br>
<b>Robert: </b>A newer HL memory friendlier release should be available very soon. Probably within a few weeks. It may have a few other goodies too.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Anything else you would like to add?
<br><br>
<b>Robert: </b>Never argue with John that it's an engine (and not an editor) bug.. he's probably right. ;-)</body></html>
