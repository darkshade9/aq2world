<b>Rust: </b>As with all first questions of interviews...Tell us about yourself and what you do, for those that don't know.
<br><br>
<b>Christian: </b>I'm a level designer and network admin (Web/FTP/NT stuff) at <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com" target="_top">id</a>.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Describe a typical day at id.
<br><br>
<b>Christian: </b>I usually roll in between 10:30-11:30am. Check e-mail/voicemail and check the news pages. Most of my day is comprised of working on my part of Quake 3. I usually take a break around 7pm or so for dinner. And work until midnight.
<br><br>
Repeat monday through friday. On weekends I usually sleep in and roll into the office around 3pm and work until midnight or so, but I also fit in time to play other games on the weekends (lately it's been BattleZone, Q2CTF, and I'm giving StarCraft another try...)
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What is your roll in the development of quake3?
<br><br>
<b>Christian: </b>Level design, work with the other designers in filtering programming requests with John Cash, work with Robert Duffy in filtering requests on Q3Radiant, and I sort of tag along with Brandon &quot;KillMe&quot; James on music work for Q3.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>After a year in Texas now, how do you like it? Wearing a cowboy hat yet? ;)
<br><br>
<b>Christian: </b>Hell no! Not wearing a cowboy hat, never will (unless I'm *REALLY* drunk). My friends back in Canada would lynch me! I like the weather in Texas, sure beats Canadian winters. Dallas is ok, but it just doesn't compare to Toronto in terms of nightlife (I was a club freak back in Toronto). The cullinary scene in Dallas is great though. A lot of good restaurants. Everyone here is generally much friendlier than Toronto.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What would you consider the most difficult aspect of level design?
<br><br>
<b>Christian: </b>Trying to be original, and finding creative ways of using new technology. Personally, my style of design is a sense of great vertical scale, so the challenge there is making something that looks huge, yet runs fast. Sewer64 is a good example of that, and is probably a good prelude to my work on Q3.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What are some of the obvious errors you see amateur level designers making?
<br><br>
<b>Christian: </b>Texture choice. Take a look at the way we use textures in Q2 and try to emulate that. Certain textures should be used in specific ways, ie: you shouldn't have a grate texture for a support beam.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What is the purpose of the 'skip' content property in quake2?
<br><br>
<b>Christian: </b>&quot;skip&quot; is similar to the &quot;hint&quot; brush. Where &quot;hint brushes&quot; make a volume that splits the PVS, a brush with &quot;skip&quot; on a face creates a plane which splits the PVS.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>So what's this about you getting new p1mpin car? Does it have air conditioning? :)
<br><br>
<b>Christian: </b>Hell yeah! You don't buy a car in Texas without air conditioning. It's my first Porsche and I love it. I'm already on the waiting list for a Boxster S when they come out next year (I'll trade my current one in)
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What do you think the major differences will be between quake3 level editing and quake2 level editing?
<br><br>
<b>Christian: </b>Well, the graphics portion of the Trinity code isn't finished yet, so that's a bit premature to ask. But so far, I'd have to say curves will be a big difference. You can do a lot of really cool things with curves, but you give up some functionality you've learned to use with the Q2 technology. Like I said, it's still in development, so things may change.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What level of yours are you most proud of designing and why?
<br><br>
<b>Christian: </b>Hmm. That's a tough one. I'd have to say I'm proud of Sewer64 because of it's scale and that I actually managed to pull it off pretty much how I envisioned it. I like the way Strike turned out. The level that I was the most proud of was a version of command that didn't ship. Originally, there were a lot more open spaces in the central computer core, so that in deathmatch you could actually leap from the top level down below, but due to speed issues, I had to fix things.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Where do you get inspiration when designing a level? Books, movies, etc?
<br><br>
<b>Christian: </b>A lot of my inspiration post Quake II (applying to Sewer64 and my current work on Q3) has been from Aliens. I pick up all the Aliens comics and books I can get my hands on. I love the dark, and grungy feeling of Alien 3, and the feeling of how you never know when something will pop out of the dark to pounce on you. I wish Fox would get their asses in gear and release their stuff on DVD instead of that destined-to-fail bullshit DIVX format so I can buy the whole Aliens trillogy on DVD and freezeframe certain architecture so that I can sketch them out.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What are some of the other games you've been playing lately and what are the ones your looking forward to playing?
<br><br>
<b>Christian: </b>I've been playing BattleZone and StarCraft lately. I sat down and played through all of Wing Commander: Prophecy in a couple days last month, and I play Magic: The Gathering with Brandon. <br><br> I'm looking forward to seeing Dune 2000 (I'm a sci-fi RTS nut), and look forward to seeing what Valve has done on Half-Life
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>When designing a map do you design it all out on paper, or just kind of have a mental image of what you want and go from there?
<br><br>
<b>Christian: </b>A bit of both. The first level of my Q3 work was drawn up on graph paper, and I built it in about 2 weeks. In the end, we weren't pleased with it, so I scrapped it and started fresh with some new concepts. Working with curves really forces you to re-think the way you design your levels. There some stuff we can do now that we really weren't able to do in either Q1 or Q2.
<br><br>
Right now I'm working from a mental image I have in my head. We're sort of in a &quot;research&quot; phase right now exploring some ideas and experimenting with the new tools, but I think in a week or two, I'll probably sit down and sketch everything out on graph paper so I have a clear picture.
<br><br>
I can't stress enough how important it is to sketch out the flow of the map on paper beforehand. I was amazed that I finished the first draft of my Q3 work so quickly from working from a sketch. It really gives you a clear picture and direction in which to work from.
 
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Any suggestions for all us amateur designers out here on how to improve our 'skillz' ?
<br><br>
<b>Christian: </b>Emulate. Look at Quake II, and find a style that appeals to you. Do your best to try to copy that style and put your own spin on it (That's what Tim taught me)
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Any closing comments (music, movies, farm animals, etc)?
<br><br>
<b>Christian: </b>Hi Mom.</body></html>
