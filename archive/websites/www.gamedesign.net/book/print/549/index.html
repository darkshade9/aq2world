<b><i> - Description</b></i>:<br> I am old by most game design standards which has it's advantages and disadvantages.<br><br>

<!--break-->

Prior to HL I was involved in a project to convert DooM monster sprites into 'Local Identities' to give us something to do on nightshift.  I started using WordCraft 2.1 in '99 or so when I discovered it on the HL CD. First major triumph was a room with a prefab metal shelf that I could bang a crowbar on, how cool is that!! I was hooked.<br><br>

I will be the first to admit that my work isn't all that brilliant and this is where the transition began. I moved into adding content to TWHL in 2002.<br><br> 

Answering questions and keeping things moving by providing tutorials on demand. I employed the test, re-test theory to all the questions I answered and was inspired by <a href="http://http://home.att.net/~firebinder/home.htm"> FireBinder's Test Chamber</a>. The more time I spent researching questions, the less time I spent on serious HL mapping.<br><br> 

There were brief interludes to create a few DoD 3.1 maps and a CS map. The CS map was created to see what all the fuss was about, I mean, after all... how hard could it be?<br><br> 

Bloody difficult was the reality. I ended up reading all of Dave J's design notes and finally rebuilt the whole map.<br><br>

The serious mapping pretty much ended there, I realised that I didn't have enough talent to produce quality map's and I decided to utilise my talents guiding and coaching those that had more talent, but didn't understand how to get their dreams to come alive.<br>

<b>BIOGRAPHY</b><br>

<b><i>Description:</i></b><br> 
I'm not making a game, I want to make the best damn book ever. That is right a book. I'm still working on the design, but have put that aside for six months to finish my PhD and get this web site restarted.<br><br>

I got hooked on editing when I discovered that QuArK editors and have mainly edit for Quake III Arena (Wolv helped me first). My images are more about the look I want, and not so much the game play. Although the idea of generating a movie in Game (Machinema) intrigues me a lot, and when I have the time (when this site is fixed), I will spend more time playing around with editors that will let me make a short film. That is ofcourse when I have upgraded the book, and submitted it for publication.<br><br>

In the real world, Im a Geologist GIS expert who refines computer models to better target mineral deposits, such as gold. So far I haven't found a <i>single</i> gold deposit yet, but who knows what will happen tomorrow. I enjoy this research because it is like looking for buried treasure, hidden by nature.<br><br>

<h3>Gary Brigadir</H3>
<B>NAME</B>: Gary Brigadir<br>
<B>ALIAS</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;"kol" (don’t know &amp; don’t care if it means something)<br>
<hr noshade color="black"><br>
<B>BIOGRAPHY</B><br><br>
<B><I> - DESCRIPTION: </I></B><br>
White Male, age 16 to 17, about 55 Kg, of nervous &amp; erratic disposition.<br><br>
<!--break-->
Personality tests pin me down as an "introvert", "Spontaneous", "Strategist?" Go figure... I hate most things, but in time get emotionally attached to anything (like my aging 4MB 3d card that I just can't throw away *sniff*)<br><br>
By day, I’m the &quot;friend of a friend&quot; who’d point you in the direction of recreational drugs, tell you crap jokes with puns and be really bored / boring, and by night, I’m pretty much the same –  only sleepier.<br><br>
<hr noshade color="gray">
<B><I> - MAPPING INTERESTS</i>:</b><br>
All.<br>
All mapping interests me.<br>
And I like constructing various Industrial and Sci-Fi environments where there is a lot of room for different props, strange architecture, set pieces, machines and lots of stuff you can have fun and interact with.<br>
Recently I’ve been trying to make a few city maps like in kingpin.<br><br>
<B><I> - SKILLS</I>:</b><br>
All Games based on Quake style engines: System Shock 2, Kingpin, Quake (duh), and Half-Life of course.<br>
WordPad (Superior to Notepad)<br>
Hammer / Worldcraft 3.x<br>
A multitude of third party tools like Wally, Sprite explorer, PakScape, too many to list...<br>
Adobe Photoshop 6<br>
Macromedia Homesite 5.5 (For my lovely website)<br>
Goldwave v5.08<br><br>
A working knowledge of (working as in: Can do, but I'd rather avoid them):<br>
Microsoft Internet Explorer<br>
Windows XP<br>
3d Studio MAX 6<br><br>
<B><I> - OTHER</I>:</B><br>
I started mapping for HL when i got the Uplink demo from a bonus CD from one of those strange PC magazines. I found out that you could make your own maps, and captivated by the tiny screenshot of Worldcraft with a little view of a map, I went off in search of the editor (even though I didn't have the game yet). I found the thing, but got scared away by the sheer amount of things you needed to have from the game. So after a while the game turned up and it all went off from there.<br><br>
I begun seriously pushing my level design abilities when I started work on Hard-Liqueur, AKA: Subzone.<br>
Now I’m attempting to replicate the level of detail seen in Nightwatch, Dark Truths, and HL: Isolation. So far so good?<br><br>
Once I rid my psyche of laziness I'll produce a death match map to shoot my father and brother in, get a job, save up loads a money, and blow it all on a brand new PC and expand my mapping to HL2 and Doom3, and Quake4. At least, that's something I just came up with... we'll see.<br>
Oh, and once I get the opportunity, I go off on a really long rant and fuel my own insane... Individuality.. err.. Arrogance.<br><br>
<hr noshade color="black"><br>
<B>PORTFOLIO</B><br><br>
<B><I> - WORK</I>:</b><br>
First Project was Hard-Liqueur, never got off the ground... Then Came along a news post in the spirit site about issues - first impressions and lack of activity suggested that they were desperate and would probably have me on board.<br><br>
That's when i decided I'd release something - that gave birth to Subzone. My little one map contribution soon expanded onto one of the largest map sets for issues, bending the 3 map limit a bit.<br> Heheh &gt;:)<br><br>

</center><br>
<center>
    <img border="0" width="250" src="content/resumes/Kol/subzone2.jpg">
</center><br><br>
Right now I'm working on Coil, a (so far) small map pack what aims to go just under the limit of hl's game engine, and be fun to play, and look Purdy.<br><br>

</center><br><br>
<B><I> - MODS AND LEVELS</I>:</B><br>
I've only released one: Subzone, and you can find that as part of Issues:<br>
<a href="http://www.issues.command-center.org/">Issues Command Center</A><br><br>
I’ve been involved in other projects also,<br>
One of them being "The Project" I was instrumental in its creation and ultimate demise... more demise than creation actually. All evidence of the project was wiped off the face of as-host servers long ago.<br><br>
I tried getting involved with several other mods, but I generally lost interest before I even tried to join, or the mod fell apart before I could make a good example of my work.<br><br>
<B><I> - MODELS</I>:</B><br>
 None released, but I'm poking around Milkshape and making a few props here and there.<br><br>
<B><I> - TEXTURES</i>:</B><br>
 I have created a few textures for my own levels, but my skills only go as far as making my own lights, signs, borders, "detail" textures etc. Nothing substantial, so there are none to download or look at.<br><br>
<B><I> - TUTORIALS</I>:</B><br>
I wrote a petty little level change tutorial for TWHL, then my writing days died down a bit...<br>
Until the project started - I wrote a few things for that:<br><br>
These included a guide to detailing Vents, Rooms and erratic e-mails detailing various concepts and options sent to Andy, the main man behind the thing.. But sadly, they are all gone. It’s probably for the better; as I was talking about stuff I never had experience in, just theory...<br><br>
Recently, my writing is starting up again -<br> I wrote some <a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/book/view/606">Generic Level Design Tips</a> and one or two truncated theoretical mapping tutorials that came in the form of forum posts. Once I get those linguistics going I'll probably write up something more comprehensive.<br><br>
<B><I> - WEBSITES</I>:</B><br>
Just one, my cosy little place with 50MB capacity:<br>
<a href=" http://www.hlcore.uni.cc/">Half-Life Core</a><br><br>
<B><I> - OTHER</I>:</B><br>
Mapping for: a long time by my counts.<br>
All my work is Single Player Half-Life based.<br>
I wanted to do some Kingpin and SystemShock2 stuff but never got the game and or resources.<br><br>
So far I haven't reached the stage where I can say "I'm a level designer by trade" I feel I haven't got enough experience or diversity, or releases for that.<br><br>
I like cake.<br>
And I also like pizzicato string quartets, lots of strange bands you never heard of, and food you’ll never taste.<br>

<b>NAME</b>: Joe<br>
<b>ALIAS</b>: m0pX,  m0p<br>

<hr noshade color="black"><br>

<b>BIOGRAPHY</b>:<br><br>

<b><i> - Description</i></b>:<br>

I'm masterofpuppets and I have been involved with computers for countless years ever since the Spectrum and C64 days. I am a programmer and a pc modder. I am also an amatuer mapper.<br><br>

<b><i> - Mapping Interests</i></b>:<br>

I map for Quake, Quake2, Quake3 (and games based on the engine), Half-Life and now Doom 3. I am not an amazing mapper to be honest, but I am very good in the architecture and texturing departments.<br><br>

I have been working in several tiny mods and map packs by members at TWHL and other mapping communities. I don't really have any released maps from games other than HL, though. I have very few finished maps around at the moment, mostly due to lazyness. Although, once I get involved in a certain map and I like what I have done so far, I usually continue and create a stunning map.<br><br>

<b><i> - Skills</i></b>:<br>

I am fairly skilled in computers and software. I am a fairly skilled C++ and PHP programmer. I have written a few programs here and there. I am quite skilled at photoshop and digital art, specialising in fire and nebula effects.<br><br>

I am involved in modding and overclocking pc's. I have built loads of pc's in my time and usually spend 1000s just to overclock and mod them. I currently use a hugely expensive P4EE system cooled with a refrigeration system.<br><br>

<hr noshade color="black"><br>

<b>PORTFOLIO:</b><br><br>

<b><i> - Work</i></b>:<br>
I don't have any serious released work at the moment but I am soon starting a Doom 3 mod which will start in development soon.<br><br>
 
This will be a real test of my skills. A new engine and a new editor. I do have a bit of unfinished work though.<br><br>

I was working on the small mod, HL: Donuts in which you play as Otis from Opposing Force. That eventually died. <a href="http://hldonuts.m0px.net">HL:Donuts official site</a> has a couple of screenshots from a map called Security-Breach which was going to be in the mod. You can download it here: <a href="http://cariad.co.za/twhl/mapvault_map.php?id=1380&dl=1">TWHL Map Vault Direct</a>. It's not the latest version, but it's pretty recent.<br><br>

<b><i>- Websites</i></b>:<br>
I run one website at the moment which I am currently rebuilding. <a href="http://m0pX.net">http://m0pX.net</a>. This version will be eventually replaced by the new version. Still, check out my forums.<br><br>

<b>BIOGRAPHY</b><br>

<b><i>Description:</i></b><br> 
Started mapping back in 1995 with the game Dark Forces.  Returned to mapping in 1998 with Half-Life.  Have spent most of mapping career focusing on style development and understanding the technical side of mapping instead of finishing maps.  I am an extreem perfectionist in that reguards.<br><br>
Got bored with mapping and decided to start writing design docsuments starting in about 2001.  Have writen a total of about five.  However, most don't live up to my expectations. I have learned a lot from this proccess.

<b><i>Work:</i></b><br>
I haven't done any major mapping in the past few years but instead have focused on project development.  Laying out several design documents.  None of these have been made public as I have yet to deem any worthy of public consumption.  I am perfectionist in that reguards.

<b><i>BIOGRAPHY:</i></b></br> 
I became interested in mapping way back in 1998 while stationed overseas.  It started with Quake 2 and after returning to the US in 1999 I eventually got around to finding a download for Q3Radiant.  I worked with it for about a year before I realized the amount of options in Q3A was just too daunting to work with and during that time, I stumbled across a small Quake 2 community, <a href="http://www.bdmcnet.com/forum/">Backshooters</a>, who warmly welcomed me into their house.  I had the benefit of learning more about Quake 2 mapping from mappers like Maric and Sven.  Over the next two years I built my skills using QERadiant and began releasing maps in 2001.<br><br>

<b><i>- MAPPING INTERESTS:</i></b><br> 
As I stated above, I have loved working with Quake 2 and am looking forward to working on some Doom 3 maps.<br><br>

<b><i>- SKILLS:</i></b><br> 
QERadiant, GTK-Radiant, Wally and PhotoShop<br><br>

<b><i>- WORK:</i></b><br> 
To date I have released only one level for Quake III Arena which wasn't all too popular but a lesson in and of itself.  I have also released six levels for Quake 2, some of which have been modified for the <a href="http://q2database.com/downloads/awaken2-mappack_2.zip">Awaken 2 mod</a> for Quake 2.  I have been involved in beta testing some code for the Awaken 2 mod but my heart is in mapping and that is where I suspect it will stay.<br><br>

I own <a href="http://www.quakequad.com">www.quakequad.com</a>, but at this point, it's more of a storage room than anything else...so don't expect to find anything if you go there!<br>

I think that is pretty much it...except that I am a homicidal maniac and by hiring me for anything you are only jeopardizing your safety and that of your other employees...families...and pets...especially the pets!  ;)<br><br>
