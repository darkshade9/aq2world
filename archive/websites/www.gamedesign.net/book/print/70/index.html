<b>Rust: </b> First of all, tell us a little bit about yourself and your position at IO Interactive.
<br><br>
<b>Casper: </b> My name is Casper Daugaard, and I am alone in Copenhagen, Denmark. When IO Interactive launched back in 1998, was I currently working as screenwriter in Zentropa Productions. I was shortly after asked by CEO of IO Interactive, Jonas Flöser about I wanted to join there really promising project, Hitman – Codename 47, as story-designer, and dialogue-writer. The details of the project were that once very small, but short after, the story was nearly completed, and the designing-phase of the production could begin. Hitman was in stores in December 2000. I am now working as an external writer for Hitman 2, which I can’t leave any details of right now.
<br><br>
 
<b>Rust: </b> Has working as a professional in the gaming industry changed your views of gaming at all?
<br><br>
<b>Casper: </b> Unfortunately yes. It has made me see right through everything, only to look after quality. But it has also helped me to judges which art of game play that is cool game play, and what a player would sit back and think, “Damn, this is awesome”.
<br><br> 

<b>Rust: </b> What do you feel is the most important part of designing a game?
<br><br> 
<b>Casper: </b> The most important part is the base. First a really nice concept, that is just so hard and sure, that almost every kind of handling if it, will result in something cool. Then the basic programming, while a more detailed story is wrote, and edited. When everything of this is done, you can start doing this that I may think is actually fun. Making the details, correcting, and making everything more cool than it was, and make it fit together, so that a player always knows his goal, but still can run into troubles. But the most important things may be the most boring.
<br><br> 

<b>Rust: </b> As a professional in the industry, what is the most common mistake you see in the design of others' games?  What's a common mistake you see other companies make?
<br><br>
<b>Casper: </b> It is rarely that big mistakes are done by other companies, as they have people who knows exactly how to discover and resolve such, but in the mod-communities for example, is the most common mistake, that the people behind the projects, tries to sell of there mod, before it is even half-started. It is a really bad idea to show of the coolest screenshots from a level, as it will only release disappointments in the last end.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b> When it comes down to actually planning out and designing a game, where do you start?
<br><br>
<b>Casper: </b> I am mostly into story-development, so I will speak about that. When you have your basic concept idea, it is actually OK to start thinking about which cool elements that you want to integrate in your more detailed story. These elements can be locations, characters, mission objectives, and conflicts. Then you can start of by doing a line of how the situation of the game is in the start, how it changes, and how it ends. Then a smaller plan of the game from start to end, were you notice were to put in the important parts of the real story, who might be unfolding (like in Hitman) or just builds on itself. When you have all this stuff, and thinks it is cool enough, the Level Designers can start off, and then you can watch over their shoulder.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b> What sources do you use for inspiration?
<br><br>
<b>Casper: </b> Mostly movies, or maybe books and often comics.  But another good way of getting inspiration is to sit down, and take your time thinking: "What would a ordinary Joe think is most cool in this situation". When you get an answer on that, you will use it.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b> What first sparked your interested in becoming a game designer in the game industry?
<br><br> 
<b>Casper: </b> When I was hearing about Hitman, I was already playing Deus Ex a lot, and enjoyed working with the editor UnrealEd. I had the ideas, but sorry not the technical experience to build my own cool levels and so. And then I was having the possibility to do what I am best of, and let others be technical.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b> What were you doing before you worked at IO Interactive? What do you envision yourself doing after your stint at IO Interactive? 
<br><br>
<b>Casper: </b> As I have mentioned before, I worked at Zentropa as screenwriter. I am planning to stay at IO so long as possible, but after that, I will surely keep on the run in the game-business.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b> While you’re not designing games, what are you doing in your spare time?
<br><br>
<b>Casper: </b> Playing tennis, and writing on movie screenplays. I had trained a lot in using UnrealEd, so I use also some time in building missions fore the Deus Ex. But working takes next to all the time right now. So free time is quite rarely, because one sad guy once founded the cursed word: Deadline.
