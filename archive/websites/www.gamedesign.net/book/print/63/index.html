<p><hr width=75% color=black noshade>

<br>

<b>Rust: </b> First of all, tell us a little about yourself and how you made it to Electronic Arts.
<br><br>
<b>Alex: </b>My career path has been a long and windy one.  One could say that I’ve had a rather diverse work history.  Prior to getting into the gaming business, I was employed in a number of different fields.  Among the positions I’ve held, I worked for AT&T, United Airlines, and a five-year tour of duty for the Bakersfield Police Department.  For various reasons, I chose not to make any of these jobs my life long career.  Through it all though, playing games was one of my biggest hobbies.
<br><br>
I had gone back to school to pursue a degree in computer science when career and hobby finally collided.  A wonderful little game called DOOM came out, and from that moment on my fate was pretty much decided.  I became a level design junkie, and eventually school was forgotten and my every waking hour was spent in front of the level editor.  Fortunately, my life was spared when Xatrix Entertainment asked me to come to work for them, thus preventing my wife from murdering me in some grisly fashion.  We packed up and moved to Los Angeles, were I would spend the next few years as the lead designer at Xatrix.  It was during this time that we shipped Redneck Rampage, Redneck Rampage Rides Again, Redneck Huntin’, Quake II Mission Pack #1: The Reckoning, and finally Kingpin.
<br><br>
After my work on Kingpin was completed, I decided that it was time to move on from Xatrix and expand my horizons.  It was around this time that I was approached by Electronic Arts and was invited to join the Bond team.  After a couple of meetings with EA, it was obvious that this was a good fit for me, and I agreed to join them.  My wife and I packed up again, and here we are now in Northern California.
<br><br>
 
<b>Rust: </b> What are the differences between making a map for The World is Not Enough and previous 1st person shooters?
<br><br>
<b>Alex: </b>I would say that the biggest difference is the fact that we’re working with a licensed property... the best for that matter.  Obviously, the world of James Bond is very well defined, with a long and celebrated history.  To ensure that we remain true to the well-established license, there are certain processes and creative boundaries we must respect and adhere to.  Although this necessitates a greater degree of structure and planning than an original concept might require, the reward of bringing the Bond universe to life easily makes up for this. 
<br><br> 

 

<b>Rust: </b> Because you’ve licensed the Quake 3 engine, I assume that you are using Q3Radiant as well.  What kinds of modifications have been made to the level editor, and will it be released with the game?
<br><br> 
<b>Alex: </b>We have a programmer dedicated solely to improving the functionality of Radiant, so we are definitely making some heavy modifications to the editor.  This, in conjunction with major changes to the editor made by Robert Duffy at id Software, as well as modifications made by the guys at Ritual and Rogue, has gone a long way to giving us a more robust tool.  There are far too many things for me to list though, so I’ll just provide a few samples of items that have either already been added, or that we are currently working on:
<ul>
<li> Multiple cameras for improved navigation
<li> Improved mouse navigation in the 3D window
<li> Multiple face selection, as well as easy cycling through individual brush faces
<li> User defined brush groupings with hierarchical relationships
<li> Improved filtering
<li> Surface based material properties
<li> Lighting Preview
</ul>
<br><br>
At this point, we’ve made no official decision as to whether or not we will release the editor with the game.  It is my assumption that we’ll want to do so, but before we can make that determination we’ll first need to check what our responsibilities are in regards to our licensing agreements.  We should have a better idea of this at a later date.
<br><br> 

<b>Rust: </b> Describe your design process, from the general idea of the map to the finished product.  Do you draw the map out first, or just fire up the editor?  Does only one-person work on a map, or does it get passed around?
<br><br>
<b>Alex: </b>Since this product follows the plot of the recently released movie, this is where the bulk of our design has been derived.  Mission ideas have been based off of key plot points from the film, and highly defined documents have been created that illustrate the layout of the levels, as well as the activities that will take place within them.  Once these designs have made it through the approval process, level designers then begin creating the environments and implementing the gameplay.  Supporting each level designer is a dedicated texture artist and programmer.  Typically, the level designer will stay with the level until its completion, although in some cases we do pass them around if the need arises.
<br><br>
 
<b>Rust: </b>  What are the biggest challenges for you in making maps in general, or specifically for The World is Not Enough?
<br><br>
<b>Alex: </b>The biggest challenge in trying to turn a film like TWINE into an interactive experience is filling in the gaps that the movie leaves behind.  Films present their stories from a controlled perspective, only showing the audience what they feel is necessary or desired.  This means that in many cases, two walls and a floor is all that the audience ever sees, and nothing exists beyond that particular set.  In a first person POV game though, the player has a full range of movement, which requires us to interpolate from the film and create what the camera in the movie never shows.  It’s a unique challenge, and one that when successfully met creates an interesting juxtaposition between the movie and the game.
<br><br>
 

<b>Rust: </b> What do you think players will be the most impressed with in The World is Not Enough in terms of level design?  
<br><br>
<b>Alex: </b>In terms of level design, I think that players will be most impressed with our attention to detail.  The fact that this game is based on a movie makes attention to detail especially important, as I believe it’s necessary for us to try to stay as true to the film as possible.  To accomplish this, we’ve put together a team of level designers that I consider one of the best in the industry, whose talents and skills are unparalleled.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b> Because The World is Not Enough is being developed for the PC and the Playstation 2, are there any special considerations you have to take in to account?  Will the levels in the PC version be very different from those in the PS2 version?
<br><br> 
<b>Alex: </b>Although both platforms are utilizing the same design, the differences in hardware are significant enough that we’ll certainly have to make some adjustments.  Specifically, the Playstation 2 has more limitations when it comes to system memory and video RAM, not to mention the lower resolution of the average NTSC television screen.  On the other hand, the Playstation 2 can process an incredible amount of polygons.  Both platforms have their strengths and weaknesses, and we’ll be sure to tailor each version accordingly.  While both products will share certain elements, the nature of the hardware will mandate that the experiences presented are not necessarily the same.</ul><h1 id="64" name="64" class="book-h1">Dan Koppel, Kingpin, Xatrix Entertainment, Inc.</h1><ul><h3>Interview -   Dan Koppel, Senior Level Designer for Kingpin, Xatrix Entertainment, Inc.</h3>

<p><hr width=75% color=black noshade>

<br>												

<B>Rust: </b>Tell us a bit about yourself, and the company you work for.
<br><br>
Dan Koppel, Senior Level Designer and Technical Coordinator here at Xatrix Entertainment. One of those lucky few that gets to work on Kingpin. 
<br><br>

<B>Rust: </b>In what ways do you think that Kingpin map design will interest the mapping community?
<br><Br>
<b>Dan: </b>First and foremost it's going to be a great game … The world of Kingpin will have plenty of possibilities, many of which will not be explored.  This leaves a whole slew of things for amateur developers to build.  Also the textures are great and they are true 24 bit, plus people can build cool real-world stuff.
<br><br>

<B>Rust: </b>Are there plans to release the editor with Kingpin?
<br><br>
<b>Dan: </b>Yes.  The current plan is to ship the editor with the game.  We have been working closely with Robert Duffy from the beginning so many of the features we use are already in the public build of QERadiant. The version that should ship with the game will work just like the current version plus we have added some great Kingpin specific features.
<br><br>

<B>Rust: </b>What do you think the learning curve on Kingpin level design will be?
<br><br>
<b>Dan: </b>Level design in it's essence is just like quake2 … We've worked long and hard at perfecting the look and feel of the game plus we have a number of added features that will truly excite the level design community such as coronas, ai scripting, lighting of models, etc. So I would say that anyone who has built a level for a current quake based game should have no problem making a level for kingpin … but mastering Kingpin level design will take plenty of effort. 
<br><br>

<B>Rust: </b>Does Xatrix have any plans to support the editing community?
<br><br>
<b>Dan: </b>Of course! We all started as amateurs and feel strongly about giving back to the community.
<br><br>

<B>Rust: </b>What does Kingpin offer level designers that other Quake 2 engine-based games do not?
<br><br>
<b>Dan: </b>If I told you now they (everyone else here) would have to burn me to crispies with our flamethrower and jump on my ashes until they blow away in the wind. ;)
<br><br>

<B>Rust: </b>Any new entities that you would like to introduce us to? 
<br><br>
<b>Dan: </b>You will see all of our new stuff when the game ships until then enjoy the screenshots and save up your money. (Don't buy beer for a couple of weekends … It will be worth it.  ;)
<br><br>
Of course, the demo will give everyone a look at some of the cool new stuff...
<br><br>

<B>Rust: </b>In what ways does Kingpin level design differ from your previous work on Q2MP1: The Reckoning?
<br><br>
<b>Dan: </b>Let's see … Quake2: Sci-fi on a red planet. Kingpin: Altered reality "PC noir" in a gang-ruled urban city. (Sorta half Brazil - half Goodfellas) Do I need to say apples and oranges?
<br><br>

<B>Rust: </b>Of the upcoming crop of 3D Shooter games, other then Kingpin, would you most be interested in doing a bit of editing with? 
<br><br>
<b>Dan: </b>Duh … Quake3 of course. Any improvements that John Carmack does to the quake engine gives me fits. ;) I love those curved surfaces. (Oooh curved surfaces….)
<br><br>

<B>Rust: </b>Are there any people in the community that you would like to thank?
<br><br>
<b>Dan: </b>There are plenty of people who helped me get to where I am today but the short list would include:  Luke 'weasl' Whiteside, Matt Sefton, crash, and Alex 'aldawg' Mayberry</ul><h1 id="92" name="92" class="book-h1">Kenn Hoekstra, Soldier of Fortune, Raven Software</h1><ul><h3>Interview -  Kenn Hoekstra, Soldier of Fortune Lead Designer, Raven Software</h3>

<p><hr width=75% color=black noshade>		

<br>

Kenn Hoekstra of Raven was gracious enough to answer a few questions I had for him regarding editing Soldier Of Fortune. For those of you who don't know what GHOUL is or some of the other SoF specific features we talk about go to the <A href=http://www.ravensoft.com/sof.shtml>Soldier of Fortune</A> page at <A href=http://www.ravensoft.com/>Ravensoft</A> and educate yourself on the cool features of this game!
<BR><BR>

<B>Rust:</B> What editor are your level designers using for SoF? (ie QERadiant etc)
<BR><BR>
<B>KH:</B> We’re using a modified version of QERadiant that we affectionately call SOFRadiant.
<BR><BR>

<B>Rust:</B> Will you be releasing the editor with the game?
<BR><BR>
<B>KH:</B> The editor and tools will be released on the net after SoF’s release.  They will not be included on the CD/with the game itself.
<BR><BR>

<B>Rust:</B> If so what will Raven be doing to support the level-design/Mod community?
<BR><BR>
<B>KH:</B> We will continue to be supportive of the level-design/Mod community for Soldier of Fortune the same way we’ve supported modifications of our previous games.   We’re generally good at answering people’s questions personally or on the message boards and our tools include useful documentation.  We’ll do whatever we can to encourage mods and to help out the mod makers.
<BR><BR>

<B>Rust:</B> How does the terrain engine relate to user made SoF levels?
<BR><BR>
<B>KH:</B> The terrain engine is pretty simple to use, but clunky at the same time.  It’s simply a matter of the designer filling in a table of information and setting variables to run a script.
<BR><BR>

<B>Rust:</B> What changes does GHOUL mean to level designers from traditional Q2 model usage in maps? (How are multiple skins handled/assigned in the editor? What does Lights Inside Ghoul Models mean? etc)
<BR><BR>
<B>KH:</B> GHOUL is more a tool for artists, modelers and animators than for designers.  Specific enemy types (skins included) can be placed in the world by level designers, but for the purpose of spawning enemies in, I believe that skins are assigned randomly.  Lights inside GHOUL models means that certain models add dynamic light to the world.  For example, the police car in the opening cinematic of the game is a GHOUL model and the flashing lights on the top are actually part of the model, not separate entities.
<BR><BR>

I'd like to that Kenn for taking time out of his busy schedule to answer these questions and provide us with the good news that we will be able to make our own SoF projects. Cheers!</ul><h1 id="201" name="201" class="book-h1">Rafael Paiz's interview</h1><ul>I asked <b>Rafael Paiz</b> a couple of Kingpin specific questions. Rafael is a great game designer, he made a lot of games, which include <b>Kingpin:Life of Crime</b>, RTCW, Redneck Rampage, etc. You can find complete list of his games <a href = "http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,10778/">here</a>.<br>

<h3>RAFAEL PAIZ INTERVIEW</h3>

<b>Rust:</b> Please tell us about yourself and how you got into gaming business?<br><br>

<b>Rafael Paiz:</b> My gaming career started in the early 90’s when I was in Miami I worked for a company called Capstone that later became Intracorp. During the time I was there I made several games Corridor 7, Operation Body Count, Witchaven to name a few.<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> Did you enjoy working on Kingpin:Life of Crime?<br><br>

<b>RF: </b>Working at Xatrix was the best time I ever had making games,
there was just a special kind of magic while I was there.
The entire team was very dedicated and we were able to
create several great games.<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> How different was working on KP from other games you
made?<br><br>

<b>RF: </b>Working on Kingpin was fairly similar to other games I had made, the major difference in Kingpin was that in the area of AI as enemies were no longer mindless chunks of meat but bad ass MOFO’s.<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> What was the best part of working on KP?<br><br>

<b>RF: </b>Well naturally the best part about working on Kingpin was that we used the Quake II engine. This helped simplify the amount of technology I had to create allowing most of my time to be devoted to content creation.<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> Was there any specific story you followed in KP?<br><br>

<b>RF: </b>There were several stories that we used to get cool material
and ideas, however for the most part we wanted from the beginning to make a game where the player could play as a bad guy.<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> Do you still play KP?<br><br>

<b>RF: </b>Not too often however I’m glad to see that the user community is still playing and that the tools we released are being used to come out with some very cool mods.<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> Do you have any tips or suggestions for a future game designers?<br><br>

<b>RF: </b>Yes I do! For God’s sake get away from the computer for a couple of hours and get some Sun :)<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> Would you like to add something else?<br><br>

<b>RF: </b>I would like to thank everyone that signed the petition to make a sequel for Kingpin. It’s things like that that make the long difficult hours working on a project like Kingpin worth it. Thanks everyone.</ul><h1 id="86" name="86" class="book-h1">Scott Dalton, Legend Entertainment</h1><ul><h3>Interview -  Scott Dalton, Lead Level Designer, Legend Entertainment</h3>

<p><hr width=75% color=black noshade>		

<br>
 							
<b>Rust: </b>So how are things going Dr?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>I have no brain juice, so any answers i gave you would be nonsensical at best and most likely more on the side of psychotic. You know those little juicer things you stick in oranges and then you squeeze the orange and all the juice comes out into a glass? Well, I was playing around with trepining and I bored a hole in my skull and so it occured to me that one of those little juicer things would fit right in there, and I could actually harness my own brain juices as a healthy shake in the morning, and one in the afternoon but after I squeezed my head out into the glass, and got a full thing of brain juice, someone threw taskmaster down the stairs at me and he knocked over my glass and i can't seem to get any more outso now i've got this plastic thing stuck in my head, and I keep thinking maybe I should get one of those RonCo dehydrator machines that has the orange-juicer attachment so that I can make brain-jerky... but I dunno 
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Tell us a bit about yourself, what you do at legend, and what you did prior to Legend.
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>Hi, I'm Scott Dalton.  I'm the lead level designer at Legend Entertainment (a Digital Ditch Digger as James would have it).  From the fabled Quake Mecca, Lawrence Kansas, a place whispered about in dark rituals and unholy rites, but rarely believed to actually exist, I was one of the founders of the impulse 9 clan.  From the group of lawrence-ites came people who would go on to companies like id, Epic, Legend and Ion...  Impulse 9 is a group of friends, we all lived together and played insane amounts of games...  We gave up sleep from the time qtest came out...  Later, Brandon "Killme" James asked me to join what would become Nihilism Unlimited, the team behind Zerstoerer, a PC for Quake, for which I did textures, models, levels, and a few odd sounds.  Just prior to joining Legend I was in Japan, studying zen and the art of level design.  Oh, I also have a second pancreas.  Its a bizarre birth defect which makes me have to eat twice the sugar of a normal human being.  So I have this bowl of sugar on my desk that I'm constantly licking and driving the flys away from.  My coworkers find this annoying at times, but thats what the hammers are for.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>How did you get the job at Legend?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>I was working on some projects and levels in Feburary of 98.  I saw that Legend was looking for some level designers for Wheel of Time.  From what I saw the game looked really great, so I contacted Glen about it.  I was living in Japan at the time, and began working on contract.  At the time all level designers for the game were offsite.  This is a very hard thing to support, so Glen was looking to bring people in house.  So upon my return to the US I came inhouse full time.  Soon after I was followed by James "Gloom" Parkman and Warrel "Taskmaster" Marshall.  And so began the decline of modern civilization.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Is it true that there is a daily office ritual of shoving Taskmaster down the stairs?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>We don't appreciate this sort of "humor" about the death of one of our employees and friends.  We're all very sad about the loss of Warren and we'll all remember him fondly.  What a horrible world it has come to when people of the media actually joke and poke fun at the death of one of our valued team members.  Its a shame he had to fall down the stairs that second and third time that fateful day, he might have pulled through if it weren't for that...
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What do you see in the future of level design?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>I see a return to sectors, linedefs, and lots of depthcueing...  That and dongles.  I see a lot of post y2k games shipping with NURBS dongles.  Also LOGO or a LOGO-derivative will likely become the standardized scripting language across all engine platforms.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What is your favorite level that "you" made?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>I made this one really cool cube with a bubbly texture on it...  It rocked, but it was too slow so I had to scrap it.  Next to that I'd have to say Sparsatorium.  It was one of my earliest levels, and looking back it shows my inexperience with editing, but in the gameplay department it saw a lot of refinement.  It got played a lot amongst my group of friends and we always had a blast on it.  I have the spirit, I do the dance.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What things have you learned while working on WoT?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>How to dodge a ball peen hammer aimed at the head.  My advice is strike squarely-avoid glancing blows.  Discard the hammer immediately if chipped... I've also learned how much Paul, Julie and Marc (our texture team) rocks, we are all eternally grateful.  They get a cookie when we let them leave the cage.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Whats your best advice for an amatuer mapper, trying to go pro?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>Don't try to become a pro.  Make maps because you love it, because its your passion.  Forsake you friends, family, jobs, and school for what you love. Do it a lot and do it better than anyone else because you -want to- not because you're looking for a job.  If you succeed, you'll not need to try to get a job, people will knock down your door to get ahold of you.  And you'll likely need to give up your friends and family if you get a job at a game company because the schedules are often extremely demanding.  Psychotic singleminded fervor to the cause needs no other reasoning... Start stockpiling automatic firearms early.  I feel sorry for those of us with families at home...  When the rapture comes, they will have to finally leave those outsiders to their own world and truly become one with the chosen in our flaming offering of righteous glory.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>How do you go about desiging a level, from start to finish.
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>Generally theres the beginning part.  Which is almost always followed by the middle part...  And finally theres this crazy end part.  Its a pretty grueling process that involves lots of mtn. dew, coffee, derisive comments from coworkers and flung ball peen hammers.  It helps if my space computer clicks and beeps as it processes my commands so that I know its working. Sometimes it starts making this whining modulated blip-blip sorta sound and I have to smack it a few times.  Jess is good at fixing problems like this. He knows space computer language codes.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>How does level design in WoT, if at all, differ from Unreal?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>Well we make our levels using a special space age polymer that hardens on contact with air, which is extremely durable but also highly flexible.  Now I have no technical architectural background so I can't say for sure that all the various factors, such as say, the high tensile strength and long term weather resitance, of said polymers actually results in a more valid construction medium over something like concrete, bricks, or straw.  But damnit, we spent all this money on the RonCo polymer injection molding system and we're going to use it.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>How much of your work will we see in WoT?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>I hope you see all of it.  I suppose it would depend on how far through the game you play, and if you find the secrets I made.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Any closing comments?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>This interview is dedicated to the loving memory of Warren "Taskmaster" Marshall.  Your skull will forever float in the skybox of our hearts.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Thanks Dr!
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>Did I mention that after my healthy brain juice shakes, I can eat a normal dinner with no worries?</ul></body></html>
