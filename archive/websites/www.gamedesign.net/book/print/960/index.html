<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Notes:</span><br />Careful placement of the path_corners ensures a smooth looking flight path. The path_corners will need to be tweaked to adjust pitch, roll and speed.<br /> This entity needs a lot of room to fly in. It also drops monster_grunt_repel based on the number of grunt_repels added initially.<br /> The resupply occurs when the grunt's are killed, based on where they were initially placed in the map.<br /> Make sure you have a path_corner over the grunts!! as this is where the Osprey will head to drop new ones when they die. </p>
