PakScape is a PAK/PK3/VOL explorer/creator. Since PK3 files are really ZIP files it can also be used as a ZIP explorer/creator. The PAK file formats supported are the formats used by games based on the Quake and Quake2 engines, including (but not limited to) Quake, Quake2, Half-Life, Soldier of Fortune and Daikatana. The VOL file format supported is the format used by the Starsiege and Starsiege Tribes games- and only the uncompressed kind.</p>

<p class="q3bg1"><b>Features</b><br>* Multiple Document Interface<br>* Explorer-like UI<br>
* Drag &amp; drop (including to and from Explorer)<br>
* Import/export files and directories</p>
<p class="q3bg1"><b>Bugs/Limitations</b><br>
* When moving objects (files and directories) all of the original objects will be deleted unless you cancel the operation in a   'Confirm Replace' dialog. Answering 'No' will only result in that the destination file is not overwritten- the file to be moved will still be deleted!<br>
* File type descriptions may be wrong for non-registered types unless you have used the file open/save dialog. I have no idea why.<br>
* If you decide to view a document (i.e. either double-click the document or choose 'Open' from the context menu) that is registered to open with PakScape the temporary file created will not be deleted when PakScape closes.</p>

<p class="q3bg1"><b>Tips and Tricks</b><br>
If you don't have a lot of free memory save the archive directly after you've added a few files. If you don't have a fast processor use normal compression when saving zip/pk3 archives. Maximum compression is a lot slower and normally doesn't compress a whole lot more than normal compression.</p></body></html>
