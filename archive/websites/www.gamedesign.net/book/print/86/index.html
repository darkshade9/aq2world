<b>Rust: </b>So how are things going Dr?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>I have no brain juice, so any answers i gave you would be nonsensical at best and most likely more on the side of psychotic. You know those little juicer things you stick in oranges and then you squeeze the orange and all the juice comes out into a glass? Well, I was playing around with trepining and I bored a hole in my skull and so it occured to me that one of those little juicer things would fit right in there, and I could actually harness my own brain juices as a healthy shake in the morning, and one in the afternoon but after I squeezed my head out into the glass, and got a full thing of brain juice, someone threw taskmaster down the stairs at me and he knocked over my glass and i can't seem to get any more outso now i've got this plastic thing stuck in my head, and I keep thinking maybe I should get one of those RonCo dehydrator machines that has the orange-juicer attachment so that I can make brain-jerky... but I dunno 
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Tell us a bit about yourself, what you do at legend, and what you did prior to Legend.
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>Hi, I'm Scott Dalton.  I'm the lead level designer at Legend Entertainment (a Digital Ditch Digger as James would have it).  From the fabled Quake Mecca, Lawrence Kansas, a place whispered about in dark rituals and unholy rites, but rarely believed to actually exist, I was one of the founders of the impulse 9 clan.  From the group of lawrence-ites came people who would go on to companies like id, Epic, Legend and Ion...  Impulse 9 is a group of friends, we all lived together and played insane amounts of games...  We gave up sleep from the time qtest came out...  Later, Brandon "Killme" James asked me to join what would become Nihilism Unlimited, the team behind Zerstoerer, a PC for Quake, for which I did textures, models, levels, and a few odd sounds.  Just prior to joining Legend I was in Japan, studying zen and the art of level design.  Oh, I also have a second pancreas.  Its a bizarre birth defect which makes me have to eat twice the sugar of a normal human being.  So I have this bowl of sugar on my desk that I'm constantly licking and driving the flys away from.  My coworkers find this annoying at times, but thats what the hammers are for.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>How did you get the job at Legend?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>I was working on some projects and levels in Feburary of 98.  I saw that Legend was looking for some level designers for Wheel of Time.  From what I saw the game looked really great, so I contacted Glen about it.  I was living in Japan at the time, and began working on contract.  At the time all level designers for the game were offsite.  This is a very hard thing to support, so Glen was looking to bring people in house.  So upon my return to the US I came inhouse full time.  Soon after I was followed by James "Gloom" Parkman and Warrel "Taskmaster" Marshall.  And so began the decline of modern civilization.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Is it true that there is a daily office ritual of shoving Taskmaster down the stairs?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>We don't appreciate this sort of "humor" about the death of one of our employees and friends.  We're all very sad about the loss of Warren and we'll all remember him fondly.  What a horrible world it has come to when people of the media actually joke and poke fun at the death of one of our valued team members.  Its a shame he had to fall down the stairs that second and third time that fateful day, he might have pulled through if it weren't for that...
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What do you see in the future of level design?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>I see a return to sectors, linedefs, and lots of depthcueing...  That and dongles.  I see a lot of post y2k games shipping with NURBS dongles.  Also LOGO or a LOGO-derivative will likely become the standardized scripting language across all engine platforms.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What is your favorite level that "you" made?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>I made this one really cool cube with a bubbly texture on it...  It rocked, but it was too slow so I had to scrap it.  Next to that I'd have to say Sparsatorium.  It was one of my earliest levels, and looking back it shows my inexperience with editing, but in the gameplay department it saw a lot of refinement.  It got played a lot amongst my group of friends and we always had a blast on it.  I have the spirit, I do the dance.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>What things have you learned while working on WoT?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>How to dodge a ball peen hammer aimed at the head.  My advice is strike squarely-avoid glancing blows.  Discard the hammer immediately if chipped... I've also learned how much Paul, Julie and Marc (our texture team) rocks, we are all eternally grateful.  They get a cookie when we let them leave the cage.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Whats your best advice for an amatuer mapper, trying to go pro?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>Don't try to become a pro.  Make maps because you love it, because its your passion.  Forsake you friends, family, jobs, and school for what you love. Do it a lot and do it better than anyone else because you -want to- not because you're looking for a job.  If you succeed, you'll not need to try to get a job, people will knock down your door to get ahold of you.  And you'll likely need to give up your friends and family if you get a job at a game company because the schedules are often extremely demanding.  Psychotic singleminded fervor to the cause needs no other reasoning... Start stockpiling automatic firearms early.  I feel sorry for those of us with families at home...  When the rapture comes, they will have to finally leave those outsiders to their own world and truly become one with the chosen in our flaming offering of righteous glory.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>How do you go about desiging a level, from start to finish.
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>Generally theres the beginning part.  Which is almost always followed by the middle part...  And finally theres this crazy end part.  Its a pretty grueling process that involves lots of mtn. dew, coffee, derisive comments from coworkers and flung ball peen hammers.  It helps if my space computer clicks and beeps as it processes my commands so that I know its working. Sometimes it starts making this whining modulated blip-blip sorta sound and I have to smack it a few times.  Jess is good at fixing problems like this. He knows space computer language codes.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>How does level design in WoT, if at all, differ from Unreal?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>Well we make our levels using a special space age polymer that hardens on contact with air, which is extremely durable but also highly flexible.  Now I have no technical architectural background so I can't say for sure that all the various factors, such as say, the high tensile strength and long term weather resitance, of said polymers actually results in a more valid construction medium over something like concrete, bricks, or straw.  But damnit, we spent all this money on the RonCo polymer injection molding system and we're going to use it.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>How much of your work will we see in WoT?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>I hope you see all of it.  I suppose it would depend on how far through the game you play, and if you find the secrets I made.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Any closing comments?
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>This interview is dedicated to the loving memory of Warren "Taskmaster" Marshall.  Your skull will forever float in the skybox of our hearts.
<br><br>

<b>Rust: </b>Thanks Dr!
<br><br>
<b>Scott: </b>Did I mention that after my healthy brain juice shakes, I can eat a normal dinner with no worries?</body></html>
