<b>[LiquidX]: </b>any release date?
<br><br>
<b>Pagan: </b>After Quake3.  thats all I can say :)
<br><br>

<b>Llama: </b>How are you going to combat q3a on the multiplayer side of things?
<br><br>
<b>ElKrem: </b>They are different games.  SOF is more of a quicker, lethal game.  One shot kills and such.<br>
<b>Pagan: </b>We are also stressing the single player game... competing directly with Q3A would be not very clever.
<br><br>

<b>[LiquidX]: </b>have you guys done any testing with the amd athlon?
<br><br>
<b>Pagan: </b>None yet....we received 2 machines early this week.... I don't think Rick has set them up because he has been on vacation until today.
<br><br>

<b>TraderX: </b>Will Soldier of Fortune Support 32 bit Textures?
<br><br>
<b>Pagan: </b>Yes..and you can change the gl internal format to force it.
<br><br>

<b>Mr_Oreo: </b>How did you guys get your start in the game industry?
<br><br>
<b>ElKrem: </b>Pagan, you first.<br>
<b>Pagan: </b>I applied for a job at Krisalis in the UK after getting my degree..... worked there for 2 years then went self employed for 6 years before applying to Raven.<br>
<b>ElKrem: </b>One day I got fed up with grad school in astronomy...  I applied at Raven...  They hired me anyway ;)
<br><br>

<b>guf: </b>Pagan what was your degree in?</b>
<br><br>
<b>Pagan: </b>Chemistry...specialising in pyshical chemistry and computer sims of reactions.
<br><br>

<b>guf: </b>and you ElKrem? astronomy?
<br><Br>
<b>ElKrem: </b>Undergrad was physics and applied mathematics.
<br><br>

<b>xegment: </b>what will the multiplayer be like? what modes? will there be teamplay out of the box?
<br><br>
<b>ElKrem: </b>Right now, we're looking at supporting several different games, from vanilla deathmatch to other, more specialized games.<br>
<b>Pagan: </b>The deathmatch is deadly... because it is real; an average person doesn't take many bullets!<br>
<b>ElKrem: </b>Teamplay will likely be supported out of the box.<br>
<b>Pagan: </b>... a lot like Action Quake.
<br><br>

<b>guf: </b>Ya, you guys had your first real dm game runs recently? how did that go?
<br><br>
<b>Pagan:</b> Twas a lot of fun... most things worked but there were a few bugs (of course).
<br><Br>

<b>AgentJ: </b>In Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force, have you finalized a list of alien races you will encounter?
<br><br>
<b>Pagan:</b> I've no idea about StarTrek...sorry.<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> I can't speak for StarTrek either... ;(
<br><br>

<b>monyx: </b>have you guys played the half life mod Counterstrike? would you say SoF is similar in terms of realism levels?
<br><br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> I haven't played it.<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> I"m afraid not... but we will now :)<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> Too much Everquest.<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> Everquest is the game of the moment here.
<br><br>

<b>xegment: </b>Are they gonna be carding when you buy SOF like they are supposed to for kingpin?
<br><br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> That is up to the individual retailers.<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> That isn't up to us...but it is very likley.  we are having parental control stuff too... so youngsters can play the game without the gore.
<br><br>

<b>ZooL: </b>Will there be animations of swimming and climbing etc?
<br><br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> There are approximately a bazillion different animations in already, with more being added for scripted events.
<br><BR>

<b>Llama: </b>Are you planning to make the game extensivly tweakable ala q1 & 2?
<br><br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> This is a tough one...<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> The game will be as tweakable as Q2 and a lot more moddable.<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> If you make it too tweakable, too many different versions get out there and a standard never really develops.<Br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> Too rigid, and people can't be creative...<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> It's a fine line, and we're trying to walk it.<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> Nathans effects system, menu system... ghoul... all can be changed.<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> You'll all have to learn C++ tho :)
<br><br>

<b>raYGunn: </b>Will SOF ship with an editor? and which one if it does?
<br><br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> There will be an editor.  Likely a version of Radiant but no promises.
<br><br> 

<b>PDC_Blitz: </b>I've heard rumors about you being able to hire out and control other operatives (soldiers of fortune, I guess you could call them :) in the game, but I haven't heard any hardcore evidence of this being in the game. Is this true, and if it is, how much control can you exert over your squadmates?
<br><br>
<b>Pagan:</b> That was considered for a while... but not in at the moment.. and likely to never be in.<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> We decided to focus on the individual player in the single player game.  It's supposed to be a very cinematic, action-oriented game.  Worrying about controlling AI teammates can get in the way of that.
<br><Br>

<b>guf: </b>What editor are you guys using? a version of Radiant?
<br><br>
<b>Pagan:</b> QERadient.
<br><br>

<b>guf: </b>How much modification have you done to the original editor?
<br><br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> A whole lot...
<br><br>

<b>[LiquidX]: </b>Will the software be as demanding on the hardware as q3a? ie a p3 500@620 getting 40fps in high quality 800x600
<br><br>
<b>Pagan:</b> We have put lots of scalability in to push the high end machines..... while still running on a Voodoo1.  So the simple answer is yes.<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> I though it looked really nice on a TNT...
<br><br>

<b>Sniper342: </b>have you been able to license the guns, or will they go by more generic names?
<b>ElKrem:</b> We're going to be using the generic names for copyright reasons...
<br><br>

<b>Crusher: </b>What are the chances a Madison native could get the opportunity to do some beta testing?
<br><br>
<b>Pagan:</b> none I'm afraid... it all goes thru Activision so if u r in Cali....much better chance<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> Well, when the time comes we MIGHT have some sway over that, but nothing for sure.
<br><br>

<b>guf: </b>You guys don't do much internal testing?
<br><br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> We test internally every day!  But the "official" QA is done through Activision.<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> the designers and artists do when they are waiting for us programmers to finish!
<br><br>

<b>xegment: </b>Is your neeto GHOUL modeling system better than what is in place in the Q3 engine?
<br><br>
<b>Pagan:</b> it looks better....takes more memory though.<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> They are different.  How's that for a non-answer?
<br><br>

<b>[LiquidX]: </b>would it be possible to beta test SoF? if so, how? (like seriously beta test it, not get a preview on the software :))
<br><br>
<b>Pagan:</b> contact the QA department at Activision.<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> Your best bet is to contact Activision Visioneers...  Pull any Madison strings or name dropping with them, and who knows...<br>
<br><Br>

<b>Zoner: </b>C++ has been seemingly slow adopting in game development it seems, the language is well suited for them, but adoption is slow.   Quake engine has an excuse (portability), but what about the others?
<br><br>
<b>Pagan:</b> We have gone over to C++ completely.  Maybe it is because the old programmers were brought up on ASM and don't like relinquishing control?  There is a learning curve for C++ .. and maybe it wasn't viable to spend the time in the past?
<br><Br>

<b>MexicanRadio: </b>Which is harder, building realistic levels a la SOF, or fantasy/SF levels?
<br><br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> Well, I'm not a designer, but from what I have seen I'd say realism is harder.<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> Realistic levels are harder.  You are not constrained by anything when doing fantasy....whereas everyone knows what a subway looks like.<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> Let's face is, most real architecture is, well, boring...  It's a challenge to make something real AND fun.
<br><br>

<b>autolycus: </b>What are your views on violence and gaming?  Have recent events made you rethink the violence levels in SoF?
<br><br>
<b>Pagan:</b> we designed it for a mature audience.... and will be putting parental locks in there.<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> Wow, that's a tough one...  No easy answers here.  First off, the game is not for kiddies.<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> we can't let a couple of psychos stop our creativity.
<br><br>

<b>Ghaleon: </b>Everyone says that you must play games all the time to work in the game industry, but learning how to program and actual programming takes all my time, how do you guys find time to play games with such busy schedules?
<br><br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> Well, you make time for the things you love to do...
<br><br>

<b>guf: </b>What audience are you, er, shooting for? (no pun intended)
<br><br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> I'm not sure of the official demographic, but it's likely the 18-35ish crowd?  Not sure about the upper end though.<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> the 20 somethings with cash to burn and high end PCs.
<br><br>

<b>guf: </b>What kind of hours do you guys work? Weekly/daily/ etc.
<br><br>
<b>Pagan:</b> Only 40-50 hours for about 75% of the time...however, during crunch time it goes up to 80-120 a week.<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> Hours vary...  sometimes nice, 40ish weeks, sometimes a whole LOT more.
<br><br>

<b>guf: </b>Are you in crunch mode now?
<br><br>
ElKrem not yet...<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> nope...normally its the last month or 2 of a project
<br><Br>

<b>odex: </b>What's the most important factor of gameplay in SoF, realism or action?
<br><br>
<b>Pagan:</b> action.....<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> I think action is the main focus.  Realism is great, but it shouldn't impede great gameplay. It should enhance it, rather.<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> If it isn't fun to play - who cares about the realism?
<br><br>

<b>Llama: </b>How on earth do raven manage to churn out quality games at such a pace? are you guys borg? :)
<br><br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> You will be assimilated<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> We have 3 projects and 50 people...<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> There are a lot of people here who pour their hearts into their work...  That makes a lot of difference.
<br><Br>

<b>guf: </b>Raven has been expanding quite a bit recently, no?
<br><Br>
<b>Pagan:</b> We haven't been expanding much in the past year at all actually.<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> Oh, and Potsy says hello.<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> if the developers are happy - things go so much better.
<br><br>

<b>Crusher: </b>Will SoF support environment mapped bump mapping? S3TC?
<br><br>
<b>Pagan:</b> No bump mapping... but s3tc is in. S3tc works a treat :)<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> We tried bump mapping, but it didn't add enough to justify it's inclusion.
<br><br>

<b>Llama: </b>With the incredible level of quality seen in recent commercial games, how do you feel about amateur mappers being left behind?
<br><br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> Well, all our mappers were amateurs once.<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> Thats why you pay for our games :)<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> Well, all except Biessman<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> but he is the mapmaster<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> and also standing behind me
<br><br>

<b>BloodBath: </b>Will SOF have different dlls for player code and Client FX like Heretic2 did?
<br><br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> There is a separate player dll. But all our effects are done with a system that you can modify yourself so they aren't required to be in a dll.<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> Nathan, who has some nasty tooth problems, has made a great effects system
<br><br>

<b>kaiser: </b>if action is the focus does this mean that the AI will be substandard?
<br><br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> No, the AI is part of what makes the action work so well.<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> Nope... the AI is great... the enemies dive out the way...looks really cool.<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> You need smart AI to put the pressure on the player, rather than the old, step into room, activate monsters, back out of room, wait for monsters to come out and gun them down one by one.
<br><br>

<b>PDC_Blitz: </b>Although we've seen enough from the banned E3 trailer to almost confirm it, I need to hear it from you guys... Will SOF be as violent, or more violent than Kingpin? Just say the words ;)
<br><br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> SOF is more graphic than Kingpin, but that isn't what we're relying on to sell our game.<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> Also, we dont say f*ck as much.<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> much more graphic violence, more blood and guts... but that is only to enhance what is already there.....
<br><Br>

<b>Jone: </b>Is it possible to tie moving 'n shooting entityes together in sof or st: voager? (say, like a moving train with doors and stuff inside that can be used)
<br><Br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> I'm not sure I understand the question, Manx?<br>
Manx: There are no limitations on that sort of thing when it is controlled through the scripter.
<br><br>

<b>kaiser: </b>will there be a story driven plot (quest) or just mission based, um.. missions?
<br><Br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> It is entirely story based.<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> Entirely story based.
<br><br>

<b>ZooL: </b>will you be able to interact with other characters?
<br><br>
<b>Pagan:</b> The interaction is mainly cinematic.....We put the systems in... it is up to the designers to put in the content.<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> As a side note, The Doctor, MasterBiess and Potsy are DMing right now, and boy are they yelling.<br>
<b>ElKrem:</b> I wish I could stream the audio into IRC.<br>
<b>Pagan:</b> I can hear them from here!
<br><br>
