 <p><b>Preface:</b><br>
    This tutorial will show you how to make your own console background and loading 
	images for your mod.</p>
	
 <ul><b>You will need:</b>
	<li> Valve's modified version of ID Software's Qlumpy.exe executable (available 
		 in the Half-Life SDK or <a href="http://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.gamedesign.net/content/half-life/tutorials/conback/qlumpy.zip?PHPSESSID=d9fc2f34f6fcd2f4da05b1b32d337229">here</a> if you dont have the SDK)
	<li> A competent image editing program (I myself use Adobe PhotoShop for all my 
	     image editing needs. However, If you need a shareware editor fast, may I 
		 suggest Jasc Software's Paint Shop Pro- Available here: <a href="http://www.jasc.com/">http://www.jasc.com/</a> )
    <li> Notepad
 </ul>

 <UL><b>Just a few notes:</b>
	<li> The console background and loading image are stored in a wad file in the 
		 mod's root directory called cached.wad. 
	<li> I would advise that you make your own mod before you do this. Don't worry, 
	     making a new mod will only take about 30 seconds, and only requires the 
		 creation of 1 file. For more on this, go <a href="http://hlpp.valveworld.com/tuts/liblist.htm">here.</a>
	<li> If you don't want to bother with that, then at least back up your current 
	     cached.wad file in your valve directory before changing it. You never know 
		 what may happen.
 </ul>

 <p><b>Making the images</b><br>
    First of all, were going to have to make the images themselves. </p>

 <ol>
	<li> Fire up your image editor. Create a new image by going to File -> New.
		 <br>&nbsp;
	<li> You should now specify the dimensions for the new image. For the purposes of 
	     this tutorial, make the dimensions 320 x 200 pixels. You may choose to 
		 experiment with this size later.
		 <br>&nbsp;
	<li> Make it! Draw something, import an image relevant to your mod, whatever.
		 <br>&nbsp;
		<ul>
			<i><b>NOTE:</b> It would be illogical to make a console background that makes 
			the text of the console unreadable. So, when designing the console background, 
			be sure to keep in mind the colour of the console text.</i>
		</ul>
		 <br>
	<li> When your finished, save your image as <b>conback.bmp</b> (note: the 
		 image must be a normal 8-bit 256 colour bitmap). You can actually name it 
		 whatever you want, but I'll use this for this tutorial.
		 <br>&nbsp;
	<li> Repeat steps 1-3 for the Loading image, and save it as <b>loadback.bmp</b>. 
		 Again, make sure it is saved as an apropriate bitmap.
 </ol>

 <p>Now that we have our images, we will compile them both into the cached.wad file 
	using the Qlumpy.exe  tool. But, a few things need to be taken care of:</p>

 <UL>
	<li> Make a new temporary folder on your hard drive. Something like <i>c:\temp\qlumpy\ </i>
		 will work best and cause you less hassles later on.
	<li> Take qlumpy.exe out of the SDK (look in the Texture Wad Tools folder) and 
		 put it in the temp directory you just made. Also, put both your images in there.
 </ul>

 <p><b>Compiling your Cached.wad</b><br>
	OK, Now were ready to compile your cached.wad file.</p>

 <ol>
	<li> Fire up Notepad. Enter the following lines exactly as they appear:
		<br>&nbsp;
		<hr><font face="courier" size="2">
			$DEST "cached.wad"<br>
			<br>
			$loadbmp "<font color="#6699CC">c:\temp\qlumpy\conback.bmp</font>"<br>
			conback qpic 0 0 <font color="#59BC3D">320 200</font><br>
			<br>
			$loadbmp "<font color="#6699CC">c:\temp\qlumpy\loadback.bmp</font>"<br>
			loading qpic 0 0 <font color="#59BC3D">320 200</font><br>
		<hr></font>
		<UL>
			<i><b>NOTE:</b> You will need to replace the <font color="#6699CC">blue</font> lines above with the 
			actual path to the images on your Hard Drive. If you have been using the 
			exact paths and names I have been using in this tutorial, then you wont 
			need to change anything.</i>
			<br>&nbsp;<br>
			<i><b>Advanced users note:</b> IF you are experimenting with different image 
			sizes, then I suggest you modify the last two numbers in <font color="#59BC3D">green</font> to reflect 
			the dimensions of your two images. </i>
		</ul>
		<br>
	<li> Save the file in your temporary directory (<i>c:\temp\qlumpy</i> in this 
		 tutorial) as <i>console.ls</i><br>
		<ul>
			<i><b>NOTE:</b> the extension you should save under must be <i>.ls,</i> NOT <i>.txt,</i> as 
			Notepad will save by default. Make sure you check after you have saved 
			this file that the extension is correct before proceeding. To do this, 
			make sure Windows is not hiding your file extensions.</i>
		</ul>
		<br>
	<li> In Notepad, goto File -> New. This time, enter the following:
		<br>&nbsp;
		<hr><font face="courier" size="2">
			qlumpy console.ls
		<hr></font>
		<br>
	<li> Save the file in your temporary directory as consolewad.bat.
		<br>&nbsp;
		<ul>
			<i><b>NOTE:</b> As above, make sure the extension is .bat, and not .txt.
			Also, you can actually name this file anything you want.</i>
		</ul>
 </ol>

 <p>Now all that remains is to simply double-click on consolewad.bat, and a dos 
	window should appear, think about all of this and eventually spit out a cached.wad 
	file.<br>
	<br>
	All you need to do is put this cached.wad file in your mod's root directory, and 
	the changes *should* take effect.</p>
