<h3>GMAX</h3>
<blockquote>
Getting Started: A Guide to Basic  Modeling - <a href="mailto:casdewit@xs4all.nl"> Pepper</a>
</blockquote>
<br><br>

<p>In this tutorial an introduction to <a href="http://www4.discreet.com/gmax/"><b>G-Max</b></a> is provided, an a beginners guide to getting started modeling</p>

<hr noshade color="black">

<p><b>What is G-Max?</b> The best way to explain it is to ask Discreet, the creatos of G-max, here is what they say:</p>

<p><i>"Gmax® is a free 3D modeling and animation tool based on Discreet's award-winning 3ds max® software. Built for gamers to create their own in-game content for gmax ready games, a gamer can produce everything from characters and vehicles to landscapes and props. Not only do you get to customize your games, you also learn 3D design within a professional-level tool.</i></p>

<p>Or put simply (in my words), G-Max is a stripped down version of 3dstudiomax. You wont be able to render scenes, create movies etc. But it is a very powerfull modeling tool, if used properly. And i will explain how the need-to-know things work. Before i start to tell what everthing does you need a registration key to be able to use G-max. Get it here: <a href="http://www4.discreet.com/gmax/"><b>G-Max</b></a>.</p>

<p>You will need to register your copy of G-Max, but dont worry! Its free!.</p>

<p>In the rest of the tutorial i will asume you have a fully working copy of the latest version of G-Max on your computer.</p>

<p>As soon as you open up G-Max you might be overwhelmed by the complex interface, this is also one of the reasons people think it has a very high learning curve. In reality it isnt  that hard, just learn the basic functions first, and where you want you can fiddle around with the other tools to find out what they do.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the tool we will use. I wont go in-depth with the other tools, since discreet supplied a few dodgy tutorials with G-max that explain some of the other functions.</p>
<br>
Here is a picture of the default layout of G-max.<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="http://img127.echo.cx/img127/4884/overview5ae.jpg" HEIGHT="650" WIDTH="1000">
<br>
Most of the things we will ignore, I'll explain the functions you need to know.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://img127.echo.cx/img127/9075/viewtools5eb.jpg"><br>
With these buttons you control the <b>viewport</b>(view your working in),from left to right:<br>
<br>
red: You use this to zoom in, click and drag in a viewport and it will zoom in.<br>
green: Use this to move the view, click and drag in a viewport and it will move.<br>
bleu: In your active viewport a yellow circle will appear, click and drag in the circle and you can move the view.<br>
<br>
Next: The <b>creation tab</b>, in this box we will create objects. Most of the tools you will use are located there. I will only explain the tools we will use.<br>
<br>
<b>Creation tab</b><br>
<img src="http://img127.echo.cx/img127/2720/creationtab4an.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b>Object type</b>:In this box you select the primitives you want to create, a primitive is a basic shape, a box, cone or plane. Click on the box and drag in the viewport of your chose. If you did everything right you created a box!<br>
See below for a small explenation in pictures.<br>
<br>
<b>Name and color</b>: In this box you specify the colour in the viewport and the object name, if you leave it blank it will name a box box1, box2 etc.<br>
<br>
A small explenation of creating objects:<br>
<br>
<img src="http://img127.echo.cx/img127/7494/box12qz.jpg"><br>
<br>
<img src="http://img127.echo.cx/img127/7857/box22wu.jpg"><br>
<br>
<img src="http://img127.echo.cx/img127/8028/box37iq.jpg"><br>
<br>
Now that was easy isnt it?<br>
<br>
Lets make out standard house out of it. We will do this by using a edit mesh, there are serval ways to go around editing primitives in G-max but il explain my personal favorite.<br>
<br>
Remember our creation tab? With the box still selected move on to the second tab, this is how it looks when selected:<br>
<br>
<img src="http://img186.echo.cx/img186/3276/modifietab4yr.jpg"><br>
<br>
As you can see there is not much to do in there yet, that is because we need to convert our primitive to a editeble model, i prefer using a <b>edit mesh</b>, here is how we do that:<br>
<br>
1. Still in the <b>modify tab</b> you should see a box with the words <b>modifier list</b> in it and a small arrow pointing down on the right of it.<br>
Click on the arrow, a list with all sort of words appears, these words are modifiers. We use this to edit a primitive in a way we enjoy.<br>
Scroll down up to <b>edit mesh</b>. And click on it.<br>
<br>
If you did everything as i told then there should be a whole list of new options, i wont explain all of the option.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://img176.echo.cx/img176/4441/editmesh1fz.jpg"><br>
<br>
This is what you should get, i always minimalize the selection box, that is the upper one in the list. To select a vertex or polygon i always use the <b>editmesh</b> properties, you can open those by clicking on the small + in front of the <b>edit mesh</b>.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://img176.echo.cx/img176/5879/editmesh25bd.jpg"><br>
<br>
At first the words vertex , polygon and face may b confusing, but its quiet simple.
<br>
<b>polygon</b>:A polygon, also know as a triangle always consists of 3 points, the so called vertexes. Between these 3 points it will create a solid surface that is visible to the human eye.<br>
<br>
<b>face</b>: A face is the same as a polygon, except that a face is 3 or more vertexes and can have a unlimited amount of vertexes.<br>
<br>
<b>vertex</b>: a point in space, this defines the edge of a polygon/face.<br>
<br>
If this still confuse you i can help you out quikly.<br>
Back in G-max we go to the <b>perspective viewport</b>. Right click on the perspective word and a menu should pop-up.<br>
Scroll down to edged faces and click on it. Now we can see the edges of the polygons and faces.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://img294.echo.cx/img294/7629/perspective3rj.jpg"><br>
<br>
Back to the <b>edit mesh</b>, click on vertex. As soon as you click on it the viewport changed, it shows 4 bleu points on the outer edges of our box. This is what the vertexes are.<br>
<br>
But, i promised that we would create a house, so lets get on with it.<br>
<br>
In the edit mesh modifier select the face mode.<br>
In the viewport click on the top of the box, the edges of the selected face should turn red.<br>
<br>

We want a angled roof, so we need to extrude it, this is how we do it:
1. we will need to switch to the selection mode, do thos by clicking on the 4-way arrow on the top of your screen.<br>
2. Select the top polygon of your box.
3. In the edit geometry tab click on <b>extrude</b>.
4. Back in your viewport click and drag the select face, it should move up and create 5 new faces.<br>
<br>
Here is how i did it:<br>
<br>
<img src="http://img291.echo.cx/img291/7453/select5cb.jpg"><br>
<br>
<img src="http://img291.echo.cx/img291/9413/polygon9ko.jpg"><br>
<br>
<img src="http://img291.echo.cx/img291/5552/extrude7jt.jpg"><br>
<br>
All we need to do now is to make a angled roof of it. Here is how we are going to do that.<br>
<br>
Earlier i told you to go into polygon mode, now we are going to use vertex mode, in the same tab we used to select the polygon mode we can select the vertex mode, do that.<br>
<br>
We need to weld the top vertexes to create a roof. To weld go back to the <b>edit geometry</b> tab. Scroll down to weld, we will use the target weld, but 0,1 is much to small to reach the other vertex, most of the time i change this to 1000. select the first 2 of the upper vertexes to weld. You can select a vertex by dragging a box around it. To add something to your selection hold <b>control</b> and click, to remove from your selection repeat the step wiht <b>alt</b>. When you got the vertexes selected weld them, repeat these steos for the other end of the roof. Here are pictures to help you understand the welding:<br>
<br>
<img src="http://img284.echo.cx/img284/6682/weld16ez.jpg"><br>
<br>
<img src="http://img284.echo.cx/img284/7675/weldr7ib.jpg"><br>
<br>
Look!! A house!! But, with a bit of imagination you can do a lot more. watch this:<br>
<br>
<img src="http://img284.echo.cx/img284/9230/housee1yr.jpg"><br>
<br>
Here is how i did this, i selected the 2 roof parts, i extruded them, Then i select the new sides of the roof and extruded them again. Thats all!!

As most people you want to get your models into game, but discreet tryed to make it as hard as possible for people to get there models into the game if there isnt a game pack.

To find out wich games are supported by G-max look here:

<br><!--break-->
First, we need to choose a blueprint. There are a few sites where you can get them for free.<br>
<br>
Onno van Braam:<br>
<a href=http://www.onnovanbraam.com><b>http://www.onnovanbraam.com</b></a><br>
<br>
Suurland:<br>
<a href=http://www.suurland.com><b>http://www.suurland.com</b></a><br>
<br>
Pick one you like, I chose this f360 from onno van(atm this picture is down, it will be up asap) braam. <a href=><b>ferrari 360</b></a>.<br>
<br>
Next where going to need <b>irfanview</b> to cut the blueprint in 4 pieces.<br>
You can get it here:<br>
<b><a href=http://www.irfanview.com/>irfanview</a><br></b>
<br>
Save the blueprint of your choice to your computer and open it up in Irfanview.<br>
<br>
You can draw a box around the blueprint, make sure it fits exactly around one view of the car, ex.: the top of the car <b>ONLY</b>.<br>
After you have drawn a box around one of the sides of the car, go to:<br>
<i>Edit-Crop selection</i><br>
<img src="content/modeling/imagecutting/example1.jpg"><br>
<br>
Now you should ony have the top-view of the car.<br>
We need the width and height of the image. To do this go to:<br>
<i>Image-Resize Resample</i><br>
<br>
This window should pop-up:<br>
<img src="content/modeling/imagecutting/example2.jpg" ><br>
<br>
If you have done everything right there should be 2 boxes with width and height. Remember those numbers and save them in the name of the jpg/bmp.<br>
In my case that would be:<br>
f360_top_433x213.jpg<br>
<br>
Repeat the steps with all the views and save them with the name you want.<br>
<br>
You can close <b>Irfanview</b> now and open up <b>milkshape</b><br>
<br>
In <b>Milkshape</b> put your mouse in one of the viewports. Do a right-mouse click and move down to:<br>
<i>Choose background image</i><br>
<br>
Now you can pick your refrence image of the car.<br>
Remember to check for the right image. You can put in the width and height of the images in the box that pops up.<br>
<br>

<h3>Making and texturing your model</h3>

<p>This tutorial will show you the basics of modelling and if you follow everything right in this tutorial you will be able to produce a splendid looking Half-Life model that represents a Car.</p>

<hr noshade color="black">
<!--break-->

<p>We will need a few things for making a model. Obviously we need a modelling program, a picture editing program and some patience.</p>
<p>For the Modelling Program, I suggest <b>Milkshape</b><br>
You can get a 30 day free trial of Milkshape here: <a href="http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft/">Chumbalum-soft</a></p>
<p>For the Picture editing program, the choice is large.<br>
You can use programs like Adobe Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro for the textures but you have to pay for them so I  recommend: <a href="http://www.thegimp.org"> TheGimp </a> and <a href="http://www.irfanview.com/"> IrfanView </a> for re-scaling and changing the format of images.</p>

<p>Once you have your Editing Suite we are ready to go.</p>

Don't forget to save your work regular

<p>Open up milkshape and you see a 4 lovely viewports just sitting there doing nothing.<br>
First we will need to change some things, go to <b>window</b>, click on it once, then go to <b>show viewport captation</b>.<br>
You should have a bar above all viewports with information about the grid size and the view axis.</p>
<center>
    <img border="0" width="241" src="content/half-life/modelling/imgs/viewport.jpg">
</center><br>

<center>
    <img border="0" width="200" src="content/half-life/modelling/imgs/tabs.jpg">
</center>
<br>

<p>I will explain what each function does.</p>
<blockquote>
<b>select</b>:<br>
With this function you can select the vertexes, faces groups and joints. One of the most used functions. This is all self explanatory.<br>
<b>move</b>:<br>
With this function you can move the faces vertexes groups and joints. First you have to select them.<br> 
<b>rotate</b>:<br>
With this tool you can rotate a face, group of vertex's joints or groups on the all the axis.<br>
<b>scale</b>:<br>
With this you can scale groups faces and groups of joints.<br>
<b>vertex</b>:<br>
This will create a vertex if you click in one of the views (viewports). One of the important things to know is that you can not select anything in 3d view.<br>
<b>face</b>:<br> 
This function will create a face between 3 specified vertexes. <b>ALWAYS</b> make those counter-clockwise. (turning a circle to the left)<br>
<b>sphere</b>,<b> geosphere</b>,<b> box</b>,<b> cylinder</b>:<br> 
These are all the basic objects. We will not use this much. I personally prefer working with plane vertexes but some people model a whole weapon from one box.<br>
<b>extrude</b>:<br> 
This will extrude the selected face. Its pushing out a new face of an already existing one.<br>
<b>joint</b>:<br>
This will create the so called joint. Each and every model needs to have at least one joint, this joint defines the centre of the model. This is the point that the Model will be aligned in Hammer. These joints are also used to define the animation of a model.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we have the tools we need to get started.</p>


<p>I took the liberty of extracting the textures from the Half-Life wad. If you want to do it yourself, search for textures with <font color=red> trk2 </font> in the name.<br>
I converted all textures to a texture format which Milkshape uses to compile the models and are used by the Half-Life engine.<br>
The format you need is an 8 bit bmp, you can convert these with <font color=orange>Irfanview</font> to the right format. I am not going to cover texture conversion in this tutorial since most of you know how to convert a image to the right format and scale. If you still don't get it, I have already made the textures and they are available in the download. I also included one .jpg file and  it's called: <font color=red>trk2_side.jpg</font></p>

<p>Next, open up Milkshape. And go to the upper-right viewport. Right mouse click in the view port and choose background image. Go to the .jpg image I included in the zip.<br>
Now we have our viewport set-up we can start adding the vertexes. Go to the model tab and select vertex.<br>
Look at the picture below, it shows you how it added the vertexes. Although it's a smart thing to do it on your own way to develop your own style.<br>
Use this picture as a reference image for the model.</p>
<center>
    <img border="0" width="404" src="content/half-life/modelling/imgs/vertexes.jpg">
</center><br>

<p>Once you have outlined your reference picture with the vertexes you can make the faces between them.<br>
<b><i>ALWAYS MAKE A FACE COUNTER-CLOCKWISE</i></b>. If you don't you will get a backfaces which are not shown in-game and which will look as if there is a hole in you model.<br>
A face always consists of 3 vertexes, go to the face tool in the models tab and select 1 vertex to start with, then move to the second one counter-clockwise.<br>
Select the last and third vertex and you should have a face. If you did it right it should show up in the 3d view as a grey coloured face and the other side should be black.<br>
Finish the total model with faces, as shown in the image above. Then select all of the faces with the select tool. <br>
Make sure you set it on face, and then you need to extrude the model. I do this because I believe there are not enough good views of the car we are making.<br>
So you now have a flat looking model but its getting the shape of a car?? good. <br>
Select the upper vertexes which forms the side of the roof, I have included a picture of it below.<br>
To select on the front vertexes and those behind it you need to de-select them, hold shift and draw a box around those vertexes you want to de-select with the right mouse button.<br>
Now you have done this you should be able to move the upper-roof vertexes back so you get a angled side of the car. Do the same with the hood and the bottom of the car, don't be afraid to experiment, you can always undo any mistakes you make.</p>

<p> Now for the wheel cases. Select the faces from ABOVE wheelcases. Go to extrude again, but now drag it back and delete the faces from the bottom of the car which would block the wheels.<br>
We will need to make a few faces on the under side of the model to make sure it is all closed, because when we extrude the wheels back we created a new gap.<br>
Select all the faces of the models and go to edit/duplicate selection. Then go to vertexes/mirror left< >right<br>
Hey, look at that we got a real car!!</p>

<p>A real car without wheels, that's ok, because we first need to texture it. Before we do that we need to divide the models in useful groups.<br>
Select the whole model from the side.<br>
Then de-select all the things in a front-back view which do not belong to the side of the car but to the roof or windshield.<br>
Then go to the groups tab with the model selected. Now press regroup, and go down to the rename tab and fill in: <font color=red>side</font> and press rename. Now your group is renamed and regrouped.<br>
Press the hide button a little bit above the rename button and voila, your sides are hidden. Now you can easily select the roof, back, windshield, front, hood, and the bottom. <br>
In the bottom group I included the wheelcases because there also black so why should we give them a different group??.<br>
The next bit is the bit I really like, we are going to give our model a really nice paint job. As you can see in the groups tab  there are no materials assigned.<br>
Go to the materials tab and click on new.<br>
Do this 6 times.<br>
Rename all those materials into logical names like side, hood, top ,etc. Then you can assign a texture to your material by clicking on the new button, the upper one because you should see 2 of them. Now for the side you pick the <font color=red>trk2_side.bmp</font> its important to pick the bmp version because that one is supported by the Half-Life game engine.</p>
<br>
<b>materials are the textured used on a model</b>
<br>
<br>
Next, you need to assign all the materials to a group, this can be used as much as you want you can use a material for more then 1 group<br>
First press control+shift+h to unhide all of your faces and groups.<br>
Select the side group by going to the groups tab. When your there go to select. Now we have our side selected.
Go back to the materials tab and select the side material, at the bottom of the tab you will find a button to assign
a material, click it. Your material is assigned. Do this with all the groups. As you can see the textures are not aligned at all and do not look good yet. To solve this we will need to align the textures.<br>
Select your group, in my case the side group and press control+t.<br>
A new window opens with the name: texture coordinate editor. Woa, there is our texture again. At the right side you see several tabs again, all self explanatory.<br>
At the first drop down menu select the group side. At the second select the remap side, that is in this case left or our right, but when you do a front of a car it is obviously the front.</p>

<p>With the Group selected and remap site press the remap button.<br>
OOOOH, our model is getting placed into the texture.<br>
You will need to match up your model with the texture show in the picture. When you switch back to the 3d view and click your right mouse button in it and select textured then you should see your model with a texture!!!
Repeat this step to all the groups. When you have done this the only thing we need are wheels.<br>
We will make them by making a cylinder in the model tabs with 1 stack and 12 or 8 sides, pick for yourself.<br>
You need to rotate it, Use the rotate button in the models tab and rotate it 90 degree on the x axis.<br>
Now duplicate your wheel with the duplicate selection tool and move it to the other wheelcase. Then select your first wheel, it should be in the groups tab as cylinder1.<br>
Duplicate it again, and select mirror left right. The materials for the side of the wheel is the trk2_side texture and for the tread of the wheel it is trk2_tread. You should be able to group it by yourself now.</p>

<p>The very lasy thing to do is to make a 'bone' for the model.<br>
Go to the tab models and select joint. Make it at the most bottom point of the wheel. We only need one.<br>
We need to assign all of our vertexes to our bone/joint so select all the vertexes and go to the joint tab. Then select assign because it should be automatically on the joint you created.<br>
Now all of your vertexes/groups/faces are assigned to the bone/joint.<br>
To compile our model we should place all the textures in the same map. I always keep it together so that is not a problem.<br>
Go to file/export/half-life smd and save it as hlcar_reference.smd.<br>
Then it will ask you to save it as a sequence or a reference, pick reference.<br>
The final thing to do is to save it as a sequence. repeat the last steps and save it as idle.smd and a sequence.<br>
The model should be ready to be compiled. Save your work.<br>
Now go to tools/half-life/generate qc file.<br>
The qc file will be used to grab the animations and textures for your model.<br>
To set it up I will place the 2 qc files I used in the download. It should make it clear how to set it up.<br>
To edit the qc file go to:tools/half-life edit qc file.</p>
<blockquote>
<b>original qc file</b>:<br>
// Output .MDL<br>
$modelname "C:\Mijn documenten\Mijn afbeeldingen\hl car\hlcar2.mdl"<br>
<br>

</blockquote>


<p><b>My qc file to compile the model</b></p>:


<blockquote>
// Output .MDL<br>
$modelname "C:\Mijn documenten\Mijn afbeeldingen\hl car\hlcar.mdl"<br>
<br>
// Directory of .SMD<br>

}<br>
<br>
// sequences: all sequences are in $cd<br>
$sequence seq-name "idle" loop fps 30 ACT_IDLE 1<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>This should be self explanatory. When your done editing your qc file you need to save it.</p>

<p>When everything is set up right and ALL your files are in the same folder you should compile your model.<br>
Do this by going to tools/half-life/compile qc file. When you have done everything right it should generate a .mdl file in the selected map. When your texture size/format is not good milkshape WILL crash.</p>

<p>This should cover most of the basic things of compiling a Half-Life model and texturing it.<br>

If you have questions feel free to ask them in the forums.<br>

<p>Modeling certain parts, such as arms, is fairly easy. You simply make your arm, then you edit->duplicate/instantiate->Duplicate Symmetry. This will mirror the arm onto the other side of the specified plane, the default being Y-Z. This is great for pieces that will not be connected with each other, but for pieces like the chest/torso of a human, it would be helpful to work on both pieces at once: making changes to one side and having them reflected in real time on the other.</p>
<p>This is the real key in working with symmetrical models. Start with your primitive, the shape from which the rest of the torso will take shape. Make sure the primitive is to the left or right of the Y-Z plane. Then alt-rightClick the object and go to "symmetrize polygons." This will mirror the selected polygon across the Y-Z plane. You now have the object mirrored as a single object, but we aren't quite done yet.</p>
<p>In order to make the changes made to one part of the object reflect on the other, you need to create something called a "symmetry map." With your new double-object selected, look to the left hand of the screen under "get". Click property, then "symmetry map." This will pop up a dialog box with a bunch of options (that you're free to explore on your own). Now close the dialog box and look to the right of the screen, under the "transform" header. There is a button that says "sym"; make sure this is depressed. Now any selection or transformation done to one side of our symmetrized object will be reflected on its corresponding part on the other side of the Y-Z plane.</p>
<p>Work away on your mesh till you are pretty much done with symmetrical stuff. Now that we have a symmetrical mesh of the torso (or whatever other symmetrical object you happen to modeling), we may wish to add some non-symmetrical elements. In order to return the mesh to a non-symmetrical editing environment, you simply click the "sym" button on the right hand side of the screen again. This causes XSI to ignore symmetry maps.</p>
<p>The final step is to weld to two halves together, which is a simple matter of selecting all of the points on one side that will connect to the other side (this also selects all the points on the other side that will connect to this side), press M, then hold alt and drag the points onto each other. This will weld them together, forming a nice, single, solid mesh. Make sure that the "sym" button is not depressed for this step (you should have turned off symmetry in the last step, anyway), as XSI gets kinda weird when snapping points that move symmetrically. The point moves X units over to snap to the other point, only to have that point move X units in the other direction. It makes a nice vibrating effect, but it's not very useful.</p>
<p>In conclusion, XSI offers modelers the ability to create half an object while XSI automatically creates the other half. Given the amount of objects in our world that are symmetrical, this is a tremendous advantage, not to mention necessary for some objects, like faces. Though the process is not intuitive, once you know how to get it started, it should be a fairly easy technique and a frequent addition to your modeling skill set. </p></ul><h1 id="1002" name="1002" class="book-h2">Creating a 'prop_physics entity'</h1><ul><!--Uploaded on Behalf of yesukai by Andy - Mar 05-->
<h3>Creating a 'prop_physics entity'</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A big part about mapping for Half-Life 2 (and Source games in general) is the use of props to spice up a level while allowing the engine to remove the detail to preserve performance. I will guide you through the creation of a prop_physics entity, which may also be used as a prop_static entity. Anything you see in grey boxes is an explanation on why something is the way it is; you can safely ignore them if you don't care why. We are going to pick a nice simple object to start with: a can of Spam.</p>
<h4>Modeling</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Start up XSI. First we are going to change the backface settings of XSI to make it more Source friendly. Go to <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">View</span> -&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">Display Options (All Cameras)</span> . Then click the  <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">Performance</span> tab, and select <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">backface culling</span>.</p>
            <table bgcolor="#c0c0c0" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
               <tbody>
                  <tr>
                     <td>
                        <p>Why? Because the Source engine, like most 3D games, does not display backfaces. With backface culling turned off in XSI (the default), you can't easily see which side of a polygon is the backface and which isn't. You could accidentally make your entire model inside out. It's safer just to have XSI display models the same way the Source engine will.</p>
                     </td>
                  </tr>
               </tbody>
            </table>
<br />
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="content/modeling/xsi_2/subdivision.gif" style="padding: 5px; float: right;" width="300" height="300" alt="Subdivision" title="Subdivision" /> With that set, we are ready to start building our model. <br />
Go to <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> Get </span> -&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> Primitive </span> -&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> Polygon Mesh </span> -&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> Cube </span>.</p>
<p>This will create a cube on the grid. Now, a can of Spam is not quite a square, it's more of a rounded rectangle. To make the cube rounded, we need to add some more edges to the sides. Press <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">I</span> to use the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> Edge Select Tool </span> , then click the top and bottom edges of one side while holding <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> CTRL</span>. They will both show red once they have been selected. Now, hit <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> Shift-D </span> to bring up the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> Subdivide Edge Op </span> dialog. By default, the subdivision amount is set to <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> 2</span>, this means what was once one piece (a square) is now two pieces (two rectangles). This really will not make the edges of the can look that round, so let's increase it. A value of <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> 5 </span> works well here, as it gives us one polygon in the middle to use as the side of the can, then two edges to use for each corner. After splitting the edges, select the top and bottom edges of the opposite side of the can, and repeat the subdivision process. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="content/modeling/xsi_2/roundededges.gif" style="padding: 5px; float: left;" width="300" height="321" alt="Rounded Edges" title="Rounded Edges" /> With the sides divided up, we are able to move the points out to make for a better looking can. <br />
Press <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> T </span> for point selection mode, then drag the selection box over all of the model's points. As the can is symmetrical, it would be in our best interest to move both side's points out the same amount and at the same time. To do this, we use the scale tool. Press <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> X </span> to use the scale tool. From the any viewport, click and hold the axis bar that points away from the center in the direction of the sides of the can. Drag the mouse to the side, and the can gets wider on that axis, all points moving away from each other on that axis; you now have a rectangular can. To make the can rounded, select only the four inner points on the sides, and scale them on that axis again, just a bit farther outward. Select the two inner-most points on each side and push those out even farther. You will probably have to use the &quot;Translate Tool&quot; (<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> V </span>) to move the points around to make for a better shape, as shown in the image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="content/modeling/xsi_2/rotoscopy.gif" style="padding: 5px; float: right;" width="300" height="290" alt="rotoscopy" title="rotoscopy" />Now that we have the basic shape of the can, we need to make sure it's proportional to a real can of Spam. This is where rotoscopy comes in handy. Rotoscopy is pretty much the process of putting a picture behind your object to help you model it. A good picture to use for this was found off of Google Image Search, and can be found <a href="this_is_not_spam.png"> here </a>. In the front view, go to the part that says <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> wireframe </span>, then go down the menu to <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> rotoscope </span>. In the dialog box that pops open, Click <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> New </span>and navigate to your reference shot of a can of Spam. Scale the model until it is approximately the same size as the can of Spam.<br />
This next step is extremely important:  go to <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">transform</span> -&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">Set Neutral Pose</span> then go to <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">transform</span> -&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">Freeze All Transforms</span>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <table bgcolor="#c0c0c0" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
               <tbody>
                  <tr>
                     <td>
                        <p>Why? XSI stores the points as being where they were created. All transformations used on them are just numbers that are applied to these points. When you export your SMD later, it will export where XSI says the points are, but not the translations. This means that your exported model would be the square you started with. By freezing the transformations, you are telling XSI that the points current position (with transformations applied) should be its starting position. Thus, it will export properly.</p>

<p>The basic model should now be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Texturing</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <img src="content/modeling/xsi_2/texturing.gif" style="padding: 5px; float: right;" width="300" height="450" alt="texturing" title="texturing" /> Texturing is the process of assigning texture coordinates to a model. The goal is to get all the polygons arranged on top of a texture while minimizing the amount of distortion. To do this, first we go to <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> Get </span> -&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> Property </span> -&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> Texture Projection </span> -&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> Cubic </span> . This will lay the polygons flat onto the texture projection. What decides which polygons go together is the direction they face. In this case, the front, back, left side, right side, bottom, and top will all be separate pieces or &quot;islands&quot; on the projection. To see what the texture projection looks like or to edit it, you need to click the view (such as <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">top</span>) on one of you viewports, and select <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> Texture Editor </span> from the menu. This changes that viewport to the texture editor. You should see the Spam picture we used earlier covered with yellow lines and red shading. First thing to do is to change that picture of Spam to a more suitable background for texturing. <a href="http://www.valve-erc.com/srcsdk/models/images/checkerboard.bmp">This</a> is the texture provided by valve, it is a checkerboard pattern, which is helpful in determining the amount of distortion. Download that image, then click <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> Clips </span> -&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> Import Clips </span> in the texture editor. Select the checkerboard image you just downloaded and hit OK. This changes the background image in the texture editor to the checkerboard. All of the flattened pieces of our image are stacked on top of each other: we must remedy this. Press <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> I </span> to turn on <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> island select </span> . In your camera (3D) view, press <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> U </span> to enter <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> Polygon Select Mode </span> . Holding <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> CTRL </span> , select the three polygons that make up the front of our can. They will be selected in the texture editor as well. Press <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> V </span> with the mouse in the texture editor to enter translate mode, and then click-drag to move the island for the front of the Spam to the side. Do the same with the back, sides, top, and bottom of the can. It may be necessary to pan/zoom the view. This is done by pressing <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> Z </span> in the texture editor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="content/modeling/xsi_2/clip.gif" style="padding: 5px; float: left;" width="300" height="304" alt="clip" title="clip" /> Once you have all the islands pulled out, you need to resize each to get rid of distortion. First, change your 3D/Camera view to <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> textured </span> so you can see your changes. Using the Scale tool, <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);"> X </span> in the texture editor, resize each piece along whatever axis is necessary to get the checkerboard's boxes to be square instead of rectangular. After you do this for each island, move them into a close as a square as you can, then select them all and scale them so that they all fit inside your square checkerboard clip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <table bgcolor="#c0c0c0" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
               <tbody>
                  <tr>
                     <td>
                      <p>Why? Texture coordinates are stored as a UV value, from 0,0 to 1,1 on the U and V axis. The clip represents this area, with the top left being 0,0 and the bottom right being 1,1.</p>
                     </td>
                  </tr>
               </tbody>
            </table>
<br />
<p>You have now assigned every surface on your model a &quot;piece&quot; of the texture. Click the maximize icon on the top right of the texture editor. Use the pan/zoom tool (Z) to position the clip in the center to make it as big as possible while still being able to see the entire clip. Press <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">Print Screen</span> on your keyboard, then load up your favorite editing program (from here on in: Photoshop) and create a new image/paste the screenshot of your desktop into the program. Using the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">Crop</span> tool, make yourself an image of only the clip area with the islands you arranged in it. Check to make sure the image is square with <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">Image</span> -&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">Image Size</span> . Now we have the texture to work on. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="content/modeling/xsi_2/skin.gif" style="padding: 5px; float: right;" width="256" height="256" alt="skin" title="skin" /> Creating the texture is pretty much just a process of coloring in the islands with whatever you want that particular set of polygons to look like. I used <a href="http://www.deskpicture.com/DPs/Miscellaneous/spam.jpg">this</a> image of Spam as a base, by copy/pasting it into my texture and resizing it to fit inside the lines that define the &quot;front&quot; polygon. I then used the Eyedropper tool to select the blue color from the image, and painted in the rest of the sides with blue. A cool thing here is that your preschool teacher lied to you. It's perfectly OK to color outside the lines; anything outside the lines isn't assigned to a polygon and hence will not be viewed. I added some text that is too small to read on the &quot;back&quot; island, and colored the top and bottom with a gold color. Of course, how you design you skin and how much detail you put into is entirely up to you. Once you have the skin done, resize it. For something as trivial as a can of Spam, I resized the texture to 256x256, though for more detailed models you may need more pixels. Remember though, texture size affects the render speed in game, so don't use the largest texture size available just because you can. Save the texture and go back to XSI.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All textures in Half-Life 2/Source need to be in VTF format, so we will run the texture through <a href="http://www.valve-erc.com/srcsdk/Materials/materials_vtex_cli.html">VTEX</a> and place the resulting file in <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">half-life 2\<span></span> hl2\ <span></span> materials\<span></span> models\ <span></span> spam </span>. We also need to create a VMT file so that the engine knows what to do with this texture. Using notepad, create a file called  <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">spam.VMT</span> that contains this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Courier New;">&quot;VertexLitGeneric&quot;<br />
{<br />
     &quot;$baseTexture&quot; &quot;models/spam/spam&quot;<br />
     &quot;$model&quot; 1<br />
}
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This lets the engine know where the texture is relative to the materials directory and that it will be used for a model.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After that little field trip, we are back in XSI. Remember the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">Clip</span> button in the texture browser? Click it again, and select <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">Import Clip</span> again. Browse to your texture, and hit OK. You should now see your islands lined up with your skins in the texture editor, and a textured model in the 3D/Camera view. But wait, before you go jumping for joy, you need to (semi)permanently affix the texture to your model. Press <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">3</span> to change XSI to <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">render</span> mode. Go to <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">Get</span> -&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">material</span> -&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">phong</span>. In the dialog box that pops up, click the little wrench icon across from <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">color</span>, then go down the menu to <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">clips</span> and select you texture. Your object is now textured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Bones and Exporting</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="content/modeling/xsi_2/bone.gif" style="padding: 5px; float: right;" width="256" height="197" alt="bone" title="bone" /> The prop needs at least one bone, as far as I'm aware, so, we're going to give it one. Press <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">2</span> to enter animation mode in XSI, then go to <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">create</span> -&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">skeleton</span> -&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">Draw 2D Chain</span>. In one of your 2D views, click twice inside the can of Spam do draw a bone. Right click to stop drawing the bone (you only need one), then select your can. Go to <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">Deform</span> -&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">Envelope</span> -&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">Set Envelope</span>. It will have you pick a bone, select the bone that you just created. Voila. The can of Spam now has a bone. <b>It has come to my attention that you may simply skip this step, as studiomdl will add its own bone by default if the model has none.</b>Time to move on to exporting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to the Valve extension for XSI, we have a fairly simple export method. With your can of Spam selected, go to <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">ValveSource</span> -&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">Export SMD</span>. In the dialog box, navigate to the hl2\modelsrc directory under the sdk_content folder in your steam directory. I used the name prop_spam for the model. Make sure the dialog says <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">Model (.smd)</span> for the file type, uncheck <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">remove all unused bones</span> (because it says so, I have no idea why.), then hit OK. Having exported the Reference SMD, you may believe that we need to export a Physics SMD and at least one Animation SMD. Good job for reading the SDK, but you're wrong. A physics SMD is a volume that defines the shape of the model while being convex. Well, our can of Spam is already convex, so we can just use the reference SMD as the physics SMD. Same goes for the animation, as it's a prop_physics and has no animations, we can use the reference SMD as the animation SMD as well. Isn't that great? Anyhow, now to move on to the wacky world of QC files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Compiling</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The good news is, we are done with XSI. The bad news is, we are starting on QC files. QC files have the reputation of being a pain, and they deserve it. I personally messed with this QC file for about 3 hours before I understood it. You see, it's easy to just copy and paste stuff out of a QC, but if you don't understand what it's doing, you are liable to make mistakes, so sit down and listen up.</p>
<p>These are the parts of our QC file, each line explained:</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Courier New;">$modelname &quot;prop_spam.mdl&quot;</p>
<br />
<p>This tells the compiler what to name the final model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Courier New;">$scale 1.0</p>
<br />
<p>This tells the compiler how big to make the model. If you accidentally made the model 10x bigger/smaller than it should be, this is a way to fix it. For now, leave it at 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Courier New;">$body &quot;Body&quot; prop_spam.smd</p>
<br />
<p>This tells the compiler what the reference model is. In this case, prop_spam.smd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Courier New;">$sequence idle &quot;prop_spam&quot; fps 15 ACT_IDLE 1</p>
<br />
<p>This is the animation. Everything, even a prop_physics, needs at least one animation (even if it's static). The name of animation is <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">idle</span>, the name of the SMD that has that animation is <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">prop_spam</span>. The rest of that has to do with function calls/code, so best leave it alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Courier New;">$surfaceprop &quot;metal&quot;</p>
<br />
<p>This tells the metal can of Spam to act like metal. Pretty simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Courier New;">$keyvalues { &quot;prop_data&quot; { &quot;base&quot; &quot;glass.small&quot; } }</p>
<br />
<p>This sets the prop_data for the model. I believe that most of this determines how the object acts in the physics system. This value was the default of the QC file I messed with to create this one, and as it appears to work just fine, &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot;. If you really want to, prop_data.txt has a lot more types to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Courier New;">$cdmaterials &quot;models\<span></span>spam&quot;</p>
<br />
<p>This is the path, relative to the materials directory, that we have our material in. In this case, it's going to be in the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">models\<span></span> spam </span> subdirectory of the materials directory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Courier New;">$collisionmodel &quot;prop_spam.smd&quot; { $mass 2.0 }</p>
<br />
<p>This line tells the compiler what to use for the physics volume, which is our model, because it's already convex. It also tells the physics system the prop's mass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's it for the QC file. All these lines should be in a file called <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">prop_spam.qc</span> in the same directory as your SMD files. Make sure that the SDK is currently set to be modding Half-Life 2 which is done through the Steam menu. Double-click the QC file, and if you have not already, tell it to open with studiomdl.exe in the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">sourcedk\<span></span> bin </span> directory. You should see a command prompt appear for a brief time, then dissapear. If all went well, you now have a couple new files in <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">half-life 2\<span></span> hl2\ <span></span> models </span>, including a MDL file. We now have a compiled model. The model will now show up in Hammer when you go to select a world model on a prop_physics. You can also load the model in HLMV to see it without putting it in-game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Common Problems</h4>

<ul><li>I keep selecting points behind the point I want to select</li></ul>
<p>Try pressing <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">U</span> to turn on Ray-Cast polygon select, then click the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">Point</span> button on the far right of the screen. This should make it so only one point gets selected at a time. Or you could just select your points in the 3D/Camera view from an angle so you know there is nothing behind it.</p>
 <p style="font-weight: bold"> - Texturing</p>
<ul><li>When I try to move an island over, it just moves one point/part of the island instead of all three flattened polygons that make up the island. </li></ul>
<p>Did you press <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">I</span> to make sure island select was on?</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold"> - Compiling</p>
<ul><li>The model exists, but it has 0 polys and I can't see it</li></ul>
<p> You did not select the can of Spam before exporting it.</p>
<ul><li>The model is textured with a pink and black checkerboard</li></ul>
<p>Either your texture is in the wrong directory, your QC file points to the wrong directory, or you didn't change your texture into a VTF/VMT. </p>
<ul><li>The model is deformed, almost square</li></ul>
<p>You didn't freeze your model in XSI like I said to after the words &quot;very important step&quot;.</p>

<h4>Spam's Away</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are done now, and the model is safely in-game. It's a fairly simple process once you know how to do it. Just think, you gained the knowledge in one article that it took me a week to figure out. As usual, if you are confused about the article or have any questions for me, send me an email at jeffca51 <span style="color: rgb(128, 128, 128);"> at </span> yahoo <span style="color: rgb(128, 128, 128);"> dot </span> com, or post a comment here.<br />
