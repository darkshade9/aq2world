 <p>This is an attempt to answer some of the more common errors that occur in Quake 2. 
	This is not meant to be a comprehensive list! There may be plenty of errors that 
	are not covered - this is merely an attempt to document the causes/solutions of 
	the more frequent ones.  Additionally, you may want to visit the 
	<a href="">Q2 Errors Tutorial</a> 
	here at Rust.</p>

<ul type="square">
	<li><b>Bounds out of range</b> <!-- inc start img --> <a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>This error may be caused by one of two conditions. The obvious one is a brush 
		that has one or more vertices outside the +/- 4096 limits. The not-so-obvious 
		one is a brush that is missing a plane (which might happen if you manually 
		edit your .map file, and also is a possible result of brush subtraction operations).
		An oft-misunderstood fact is how brushes are constructed for the Q2 engine... 
		the x,y,z triplets in your .map file are NOT necessarily brush vertices - they 
		are simply points that define the plane. Brushes are constructed by starting 
		with an infinite solid and then removing everything on one side of the planes 
		that define the brush. This, coincidentally, is why you cannot have a concave 
		brush (think about it). In the case of a cube with the top face missing, the 
		brush will be infinitely tall (infinity in Q2 being 8192, of course)... which 
		leads to the bounds out of range error.</p>

	<li><b>Duplicate Plane</b> <a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>This error was likely caused by an edge manipulation where you pulled one edge 
		toward the center of a brush such that two faces now lie on the same plane - for 
		example turning a cube into a wedge.  It could also be the result of a brush 
		subtraction operation. </p>

	<li><b>FloatPlane: bad normal</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>Collinear points are usually to blame for this error. In many cases, 2 points are 
		identical. This error is sometimes caused by faulty edge manipulation: pulling one 
		edge of a face until it lines up with another edge of the same face, for example.</p>

	<li><b>Microbrush</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>Microbrushes have a volume less than a 1x1x1 unit cube. Microbrushes are 
		frequently generated by complex brush subtraction operations, but might also be 
		generated by editors with floating-point conversion problems. In the first case, you 
		will generally be better off building complex objects manually rather than using 
		brush subtraction. In the second case, you can prevent this error by insuring that 
		brush vertices lie on grid units. Microbrushes are frequently drawn incorrectly in 
		the game, so you will likely want to find and delete this brush.</p>

	<li><b>Mirrored Plane</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>This error indicates that a brush has no thickness in one or more directions, i.e. 
		opposing faces of the brush lie on the same plane. This error may be generated by 
		building a brush less than 1 unit thick - one face's coordinate gets rounded up, 
		and the opposite face's coordinate gets rounded down. This situation can be 
		avoided by insuring that a brush's vertices lie on grid units.</p>

	<li><b>Mixed Face Contents</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>Content properties must be identical for all faces of a brush. You <b>can</b>, 
		however, have different surface properties.</p>

	<li><b>No visible sides on brush</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>This error indicates that the bounding box coordinates for the brush are 
		completely outside the +/-4096 limits in one or more directions. Note that 
		this error may be generated by a faulty bounding box being calculated by 
		qbsp3. In this case, one or more faces of the brush are fouled up to the 
		extent that you will probably be better off deleting the brush and 
		re-creating it.</p>

	<li><b>Origin brushes not allowed in world</b> <!-- inc end img --><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>This error is frequently caused by attempting (but failing) to add an 
		origin brush to a func_door_rotating or func_rotating. Methods for grouping 
		origin brushes with entities differ with the various editors. Consult your 
		editor's documentation.</p>

	<li><b>Plane with no normal</b> 
	 <P>This error generally indicates that the points defining a plane are 
		collinear or that 2 points are identical. Find and delete this 
		brush.</P>

<hr color=black noshade width=75%>
<h3>QVIS Errors</h3>

<ul type="square">
	<li><b>Leafportals saw into leaf</b>
	 <P>It's not so simple as finding the single offending "leafportal" brush. As 
		your map increases in size or simply changes brushes that generate no errors 
		can become causes of leafportal errors. Worse is that subsequent compiles of 
		the unchanged map may produce more or fewer leafportal errors, and this lack 
		of consistency makes finding the error even more maddening.<br>
		<br>
		Often the worst offenders are brushes with many faces sharing the same vertex (like a 
		spike or a skewed brush with a mitered corner).<br>
		<br>
		Advice often given is to "simplify". While this is useful advice up to a point I suppose, tracking 
		down specific troublesome brushes as they relate to their environment (your 
		map) is the real key (good luck). If you do find them, I've recently 
		discovered that making them and the brushes they adjoin detail brushes may 
		correct the problem, as will making them brush entities like func_walls. 
		(Since this is a vis error, this makes sense when you think about 
		it).</p>

		QVIS Errors</a> tutorial here at Rust.</p>
</ul>

<hr color=black noshade width=75%>
<h3>QRAD Errors</h3>

<ul type="square">
	<li><b>face with too many light styles (x y z)</b>
	 <p>There are too many different dynamic light styles, such as flashing 
		lights, that hit a single face of a brush. The limit is 4 light styles 
		that can hit a face. The best solution is to reduce the number of 
		lights in the area or spread them out further. The coordinates tell you 
		which brush face has caused the problem, which tells you indirectly where 
		the problem lights are. Note that this error <b>may</b> be 
		associated with a target_lightramp.</p>

<hr color=black noshade width=75%>
<h3>Startup and Runtime Errors</h3>

<ul type="square">
	<li><b>Missing texture</b> <!-- inc start end img --><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>A custom texture was used and it isn't in the gamedir/textures dir. 
		Remember in q2 textures are not included in .bsp files, if you use custom 
		textures, include the .wals in your zip with install instructions, or better 
		yet, distribute as a .pak with a maps/mymap.bsp and a 
		textures/mytexture.wal. </p>
		
	<li><b>CDAudio: Invalid track 1 specified</b>
	 <p>The CD track ("sounds" key in worldspawn entity) must be 2 through 11 to 
		match the audio tracks on the Q2 CD-ROM. (Track 1 is the Quake 2 
		installation files.) </p>

	<li><b>No music plays in the map</b>
	 <P>Add the "sounds" key in the worldspawn entity and specify a CD track 
		number, 2 through 11.</P>

	<li><b>No spawn function for xxxx</b>
	 <p>Typically caused by not specifying the proper +set game setting. 
		The entity can't appear properly since the proper entity information isn't 
		available with the default Quake 2 game. Run the game with the proper 
		+set game XXXX parameter.</p>

    <li><b>areaportals&gt;=numareaportals (when opening a door; bombs to console)</b>
	 <p>Since areaportals affect vis, you must do a full bsp and some sort of vis 
		after changing them, NOT just a bsp -onlyents. Additionally, can be caused 
		by a bad areaportal - if you get an areaportal message during compilation, 
		you may see this error in the game.</p>

    <li><b>Bad surface extents</b>
     <p>This error might occur on maps compiled with the -chop option for qbsp3, 
		with chop values greater than the default 240. This error is more likely to 
		occur while using software rendering than GL. This error is seen at the 
		console when attempting to load the map. The map crashes when it occurs. If 
		you have <b>not</b> used the -chop option with a chop value 
		greater than 240, try using -chop with values smaller than 240. When you 
		find a value that works, increase the value until the error occurs again, 
		then back off of that value slightly.</p>
		
	<li><b>Com_sprintf: overflow of X in 32 </b></b> <!-- inc start img --><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <p>The message field in the worldspawn entity (used as the title of your 
		map) contains too many characters. The maximum length of this field to 
		prevent this error is 22 characters. This error is generally harmless, but 
		note that worldspawn messages longer than 28 characters will not fit across 
		the width of the F1 Help computer.</p>

    <li><b>connected teleport path_corners</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <p>You have two or more sequential path_corners which both have the teleport 
		spawnflag set.</p>

    <li><b>couldn't find destination &lt;target&gt;</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <p>This error results from a missing, inhibited, or wrongly-named 
		misc_teleporter_dest.</p>

    <li><b>couldn't find spawn point</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>The map does not have an info_player_start (for Single Player mode), 
		info_player_deathmatch entity (for Deathmatch mode), or info_player_team1 
		and info_player_team2 (for CTF mode.)</p>

	<li><b>droptofloor: [item] startsolid at (x y z)</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <p>All Quake 2 models have an associated bounding box that cannot be 
		embedded in a world brush. For example, all weapon, ammo, item, and key 
		entities have a 32x32x32 bounding box centered at the origin of that entity, 
		so these items must be placed with their origin at least 16 units away from 
		the surface of any world brush.</p>
		
	<li><b>ED_Alloc: no free edicts</b> <!-- exemt img -->
     <p>There are too many entities or active objects (flying bullets, 
		explosions, debris, lasers, etc.) in your map.</p>
		
	<li><b>elevator used with no pathtarget by func_button at ( x y z )</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <p>Entities which target trigger_elevators (normally func_buttons) must also 
		use the pathtarget field to specify which path_corner the elevator is to 
		travel to when the elevator is triggered.</p>

    <li><b>&lt;entity&gt; without a target</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <P>Many entities (e.g. func_train) require a target to function 
		properly.</p>

    <li><b>Entity used itself</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>You have an entity which has the same value for its target and 
		targetname. If it is caused to trigger its target, it tries to trigger 
		itself. This error is seen on the screen during gameplay.</P>

    <li><b>ERROR: Index Overflow</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>There are too many unique models or too many unique sounds in your 
		map. You cannot have more than 256 unique models or 256 unique sounds 
		in a map. Every brush model (e.g. func_door, trigger_once) counts as a 
		unique model. For more information see <A 
		href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/eio.html">Error: Index Overflow (and 
		Other Horrible Nasty Problems) SOLVED</A>.</P>

    <li><b>[classname] at (x y z) has invalid spawnflags set</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>Self-explanatory. This error will not cause any runtime problems, 
		but may indicate that you meant to set a particular spawnflag but typed in a 
		wrong value instead.</P>

    <li><b>func_timer at ( x y z ) has random &gt;= wait</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
	 <P>Self-explanatory. In this case the game will override the random value 
		and use "wait" - FRAMETIME (0.01 seconds).</P>

    <li><b>func_train without a target</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>Func_trains must target a path_corner</P>

    <li><b>func_wall START_ON without TOGGLE</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>This is a nag error - the game will force the TOGGLE spawnflag in this 
		case, and the func_wall will function properly.</P>

    <li><b>&lt;entity&gt; at ( x y z ) has invalid spawnflags set</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>Self-explanatory. If you consistently get this error, it is possible that 
		your editor's entity definition file(s) are fouled up.</P>

    <li><b>item &lt;item&gt; not found for trigger_key at ( x y z )</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>The trigger_key has an invalid item field. Though the item is normally a 
		key entity, you can also use ammo, weapons, and any item entity other than 
		health. You might, for example, take weapons away from a player by setting 
		the item field to a weapon entity.</P>

    <li><b>&lt;key&gt; is not a field </b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>Your map contains an invalid key-value pair. Either your editor has 
		incorrectly inserted an invalid key (that may be valid in another game) or 
		you have manually typed in an invalid key.</P>

    <li><b>PF_SetModel: NULL </b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>An entity that requires one or more brushes to function correctly does 
		not have an associated brush. The usual suspects in this case are trigger 
		brushes (trigger_once, trigger_multiple, etc.). Download <A 
		href="http://www.magnolia.net/~rascal/mapspy.zip">MapSpy</A> to help track 
		down the offending entity.</P>

    <li><b>G_PickTarget: target [name] not found</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>A point_combat entity may only be used once. You cannot have multiple 
		monsters combattarget the same point_combat.</P>

    <li><b>Map does not have an empty leaf</b> <!-- exemt img -->
     <P>This error is caused by a bug in Quake2, and usually occurs when all 
		leafs of a map contain clip brushes. This error is generally only produced 
		in small test maps with few leafs. You can avoid this error by moving clip 
		brushes around, or download a different version of <A 
		href="http://www.magnolia.net/~rascal/qbsp3.zip">qbsp3</A>, which 
		automatically generates an empty leaf if one is not found. This error is 
		seen on the console when loading the map, and the map crashes when it 
		occurs.</P>

    <li><b>&lt;monster&gt; at ( x y z ) has bad item &lt;item&gt;</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>Monsters (including turret_drivers) can drop ammo, weapons, keys, and any 
		item entity other than health.</P>

    <li><b>&lt;monster&gt; ( x y z ) has a bad combattarget &lt;combattarget&gt;: 
	&lt;classname&gt; at ( x y z ) </b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>Combattargets must be point_combat.</P>

    <li><b>&lt;monster&gt; at ( x y z ) has target with mixed types.</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>This error occurs if either 1) monster has a target that is NOT a 
		point_combat and also has a combattarget, or 2) monster has a target that IS 
		a point_combat AND a target that is NOT a point_combat.</P>

    <li><b>&lt;monster&gt; can't find target &lt;target&gt; at ( x y z )</b> <!-- inc end img --><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>The monster targets an entity that does not exist.</P>

    <li><b>Ran out of faces for bmodel</b>
     <P>A large func_water entity is filling an area with a very complex solid 
		surface. A solution is to break the func_water up into smaller entities, 
		start the func_water with the more complex brushes already breaking the 
		surface, or remove some of the more complex brushes in its 
		path.</P>

    <li><b>SZ_GetSpace: Overflow</b>
     <P>The game engine can see too many entities. If you have not already run 
		vis, try a -fast vis. This will usually fix the problem. If it does not, you 
		<B>may</B> be able to solve the problem with a full vis, but this may only 
		obscure a problem that might occur during play (rather than when the level 
		first loads). For example, a full vis may allow you to start the map, but 
		then you might get this error when firing rockets or grenades at a squad of 
		gunners. If a full vis does not solve the problem, you have several 
		choices:<BR>
		<BR>
		- Eliminate entities<BR>
		- Use func_areaportals in your doors<BR>
		- Add vis-blocking architecture, i.e. 90 degree bends in hallways, 
		  doughnut hallways, etc.<BR>
		<BR>
		<b>Special case:</b> You may 
		sometimes get this error message when tracking down leaks using LeakHunter, 
		even though your level contains very few entities. In this case, the 
		pointfile that contains leak information is too large - LeakHunter generates 
		a laser for each segment of the pointfile, and since all segments will be 
		visible to the engine, too many lasers cause this crash. You can eliminate 
		this problem by editing your pointfile with a text editor and deleting 
		points. The pointfile starts in the void and works its way into your map, 
		ending at an entity. You should be able to delete all points after, for 
		example, the 20th point and still have sufficient information in the 
		pointfile to find the leak. Note that LeakHunter will always spawn the 
		player at the last point in the pointfile, so you will not have a problem 
		finding the starting laser segment. Note that having very few entities in 
		your map (so the path from an entity to a leak is longer) usually generates 
		large pointfiles. As an alternative to deleting points in the pointfile, you 
		can temporarily add several light entities to your map and re-compile. This 
		should result in a much smaller pointfile that will not cause the 
		SZ_GetSpace Overflow error with LeakHunter.</P>

    <li><b>target_help with no message at ( x y z )</b> <!-- inc start img --><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>Self-explanatory. Target_help must have a message field (otherwise what's 
		the point?)</P>

    <li><b>target_lightramp has bad ramp (&lt;ramp&gt;)</b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>The message field of target_lightramp must be 2 and only 2 characters, 
		and both characters must be lowercase letters. The first letter specifies 
		the starting lightlevel; 2nd letter specifies the ending lightlevel. a is 
		darkest; z is brightest. For example "az" would ramp from dark to bright and 
		"za" from bright to dark.</P>

    <li><b>target_lightramp target &lt;target&gt; (&lt;classname&gt; at ( x 
    y z )) is not a light. </b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>Target_lightramps may only target light entities. This prohibition 
		includes light_mine1 and light_mine2.</P>

    <li><b>teleporter without a target at ( x y z ) </b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>Misc_teleporter should target a misc_teleporter_dest. With no target, the 
		misc_teleporter will not appear in the game.</P>

    <li><b>train_find: target &lt;target&gt; not found </b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>There is no entity (should be a path_corner) whose targetname matches the 
		target field of the func_train.</P>

    <li><b>trigger_elevator at ( x y z ) target &lt;target&gt; is not a train. </b><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>As implied, trigger_elevators must target a func_train.</P>

    <li><b>trigger_elevator at ( x y z ) unable to find target &lt;target&gt; </b> <!-- inc end img --><a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a> 
     <P>The target of the trigger_elevator (which should be a func_train) does 
		not exist.</P>

    <li><b>Quake 2 simply crashes without an error</b>
     <P>Major causes for this include:<br>
		- Worldcraft putting animated textures in UPPERCASE. Fix using 
		<A href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/">MapSpy</A>.
		<a href="http://mapspy.gamedesign.net/"><img border=0 src="/"></a><BR>
		- Lack of a Worldspawn entity.<BR>
		- A VERY low amount of space for a swapfile while loading a large map.<BR>
		- Spawning many entities simultaneously.</P>

			The angles in Q2 don't match what you're used to in real life. 0 - is to the
			right(East) looking from the top view. Then, it's 90 to the North, 180 to the West, and
			270 to the South. -1 is up, and -2 is down. Also, there is a bug with the trigger_push
			entity, you should use 1 instead of 0 if you want the player to be pushed Eastward.

			Attenuation = -1 works fine for non-looped sounds. Looped sounds are always attenuation
			= 3, regardless of what you enter for this value. If you want a looped sound to be heard
			across the entire map:<br>
			1) Find the duration of the sound using Sound Recorder or other audio program. If the .wav
			file is in one of the Q2 paks, you may have to extract it to your hard disk first. If you
			don't have a pak editor to do this, a good one is qped, available from
			www.planetquake.com/qped.<br>
			2) Add a func_timer to your level, with the &quot;start on&quot; spawnflag. The wait value
			of the func_timer should be set to the duration of the .wav file. Target your
			target_speaker with the func_timer. (David Hyde)

		<a name="4">
        <li><b>How do I use a sound I made in Quake 2 with the target_speaker entity?</b><br>

			First make sure your .wav file is mono rather than stereo. Create a custom directory
			for your custom sounds so that you don't get confused about what sounds came from who or
			where. All sounds must go somewhere below baseq2\sound, so create a subdirectory
			baseq2\sound\mysound, for example. In the .map, reference the sound including the relative
			path below baseq2\sound. For example, the noise field of your target speaker would be
			&quot;mysound/mywav.wav&quot;. Note the forward slash rather than a backslash. (David

            Once again, use the Team attribute for the two entities. Place the two items (for

            &quot;weaponspawn&quot;). Then, one of them will be spawned, after that item it taken, the

            Unfortunately, you can't turn the trigger_push on or off using the standard Q2 entity.

			Unlike Quake 1, which had no visible signs of teleporters, Quake 2 teleporters have a

			Skies in Quake 2 are slightly different. They need to be defined using the Sky
			attribute in the Worldspawn entity. (And to keep all you Qoole users from asking, you
			modify the Worldspawn entity in Qoole by not having anything else selected and choosing
			the entity properties). The valid skies are unit1_ through unit9_ and space1. Then, any
			texture with a surface property of sky will use the sky defined. (See the tutorial page

            Unfortunately, you cannot make just one big brush with a 90 degree bend in it. It must
            be made of smaller separate brushes (you can later group them in you editor). This is
            because the Quake engine cannot handle concave brushes. You can check if a brush is
            concave in your head like this: Think of one of the vertices in the brush, and see if you
            can make an imaginary line to another one, where the line goes outside the brush.

            Not without coding or using a mod that supports it. The original Quake 2 engine doesn't
            allow the default light entities to move. The Quake 2 Mission Pack: The Reckoning,

            You can't. The func_train entity in Quake 2 can't rotate around an axis. Like the
            rotating light question however, it all depends on how an entity is coded. Hexen II, for
            example, has such an entity. So, you'll either have to do coding of your own entity to do
            this or find a mod that has one.

            The &quot;sparks&quot; themselves are actually the target_splash entity. However, as
            the entity name implies, this entity needs to be targeted in order to work. Typically, the
            target_splash entity is targeted by a func_timer entity, with the random property set. See

        <li><b>I've heard someone mention &quot;point entity&quot; and &quot;solid

            A point entity is an entity that doesn't require a user-defined model to work. For
            example, a monster is an example of a point entity since it has a pre-defined model
            associated with it. A solid entity, however, requires the editor to manually define a
            brush to be associated with the entity. For example, a door entity is an example of a
            solid entity. The editor has to define what brush (or brushes) make up the physical door.
            If a solid entity is not associated with a brush, a PF:SetModel = None error or something
            similar when the level is started.

            The func_water entity isn't required for static pools of water or water with currents.
            It's a specialized entity used for rising/falling water that's activated by a trigger or
            button. However, the water texture used for func_water can not be transparent! See the

            This occurs when the Origin brush hasn't been properly grouped with the rest of the

            surface property to ALL sides of a brush to create the ladder. See the Surface Properties
            tutorial on the tutorials page for more information.

        <li><b>What about currents...how are they created? </b><br>

            Like ladders, currents are created by applying the appropriate current surface property
            to liquid textures. See the Surface Properties tutorial on the tutorials page for more
            information.

        <li><b>I've got a texture with text on it, but the text is backwards. How do I 'flip'
            the texture so the text is readable?</b><br>

            Textures can be 'flipped' by putting a -1 value in the X-axis Scale attribute for that
            texture surface. This is most useful for textures that have some sort of readable text.

            Create a func_wall entity on a brush.&nbsp; Then, on the side you want to see <strong>through</strong>,
            select the Skip surface property.

        <li><b>How do you make it so an animated texture moves when triggered like in the
            research lab where you hit a button and the display monitor texture starts moving?</b><br>

            That particular &quot;trick&quot; is done as follows: It's actually two separate
            func_walls at each monitor location. The func_wall that's initially seen has trigger
            spawn, toggle, start on, and animated spawnflags set. The other has trigger spawn and
            toggle spawnflags. Both func_walls have the same targetname. The button targets both
            func_walls, and their visibility flip-flops.

            It basically makes certain animated texture animated. Animated Fast makes it animate
            faster than normal. However, it should be noted that this does only work with certain
            textures, for example, e1u2/keydran1_1(&amp; 1_2). Other textures may not show any effect

<h3>Compiling, Leaks and Errors</h3><br>

	<ul type="square">
		<a name="37">
        <li><b>Every time I try to compile my map with the latest versions of qbsp3.exe or any
            of the other compilers, it crashes and I get some message saying that the program
            performed an illegal option or something to that effect. How do I fix this?</b><br>

            You don't have enough virtual memory for the compilers to finish (they're hogs, so you
            have to give them plenty of room!) Go to Control Panel, System, Performance, Virtual
            Memory. Turn off letting Win95 (or Win98) handle the swapfile and switch it to be located
            on the drive with the most free space. It's not unusual for the compilers to need 100Mb to
            500Mb of free space, depending on the size of the maps. <br>
            <br>
            Unfortunately, if you don't have that sort of room you've got 2 choices:<br>
            -delete some stuff (and run a disk defrag afterwards)<br>
            -get another hard drive.

        <li><b>After compiling my level, I notice that I can see &quot;through&quot; the sky
            into another room in my level. How can I keep this from happening?</b><br>

            First, make sure that you've done a full VIS which sometimes helps clear up this
            problem. Also, you can use a Hint brush between the player and the sky.
            However, sometimes these methods won't clear up the problem, so you have to always
            consider this when designing your maps. Plan ahead and if need be, use blocker walls
            and the like to help obstruct the view into these areas.

        <li><b>My level takes ### hours/days/weeks to compile. Am I doing something wrong? </b><br>

            This is a next-to-impossible question to answer. The fact is that how complex your
            level is determines how long it will compile. And this means how complex your level is to
            the Quake engine, not your perception of complex. If your level is taking longer than you
            think it should, you need to understand WHY it's taking so long. Things like texture
            lighting, large open spaces, etc. can all dramatically increase the time it takes to
            compile a level. See the Tutorials and Style pages here at Rust for a better idea of how
            to create good levels.

            level disappear at certain angles...what causes this and how can I fix it? </b><br>

            In most instances, a full VIS compile on the level will correct this. Typically, this
            solves the problems. However, if it occurs after a full compile, you've probably got an
            area that's far too complex or big for the Quake2 engine to handle. In which case, you'll
            have to simplify your level.

        <li><b>Why is my map always/never lighted, even though I place entities? (I have a
            leak, btw) </b><br>

            Check your maps for leaks during the BSP compile. If you see the message
            &quot;***Leaked***&quot; any time during that compile, then the VIS and Radiosity
            compilers will not take effect. Hence, the level will either be completely dark or
            fullbright.

		<a name="42">
        <li><b>Ok, I checked and my map doesn't leak, yet it's still not lighted, even though I
            place entities? </b><br>

            Be sure you're running the compilers in order. The proper order is QBSP, then the VIS
            compiler, finally the Radiosity compiler (which handles lighting). Additionally, make sure
            ambient light is set to zero or a decimal value.

            Entities are not calculated during the radiosity compile, so they can't block light.
            So, you get a &quot;leaking&quot; effect since the Q2 engine and light compiler
            pretty much act as if the door isn't there. Unfortunately, there is no way to
            actually prevent this from happening, so you have 2 options: either move the light far
            enough away (or decrease its intensity) from the door or put an offsetting light on the
            other side of the door for a more gradual lighting effect.

            No, a -level # parameter used with the VIS compiler will be ignored by the compiler for
            Quake 2. The -level 4 parameter for the VIS compiler DID improve the quality of
            Quake 1 maps, but with Quake 2 the parameter is ignored. So, while it can be
            specified, it won't actually make any improvements to the maps (nor will it have any
            adverse affects.) It's merely a carryover from the Q1 days.

<h3>Advanced Questions</h3><br>
	<ul>
		<a name="50">
        <li><b>How do I configure difficulty settings for my levels?</b><br>

            A lot will depend on the editor you use. However, difficulty settings are
            configured for entities by the use of spawnflags. If you have to manually enter the
            spawnflag values in your editor, the values are as follows:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Not in Easy=256
				<li>Not in Normal=512
				<li>Not in Hard=1024
				<li>Not in Deathmatch=2048 (not needed for monsters or other items don't appear in DM
					mode)
			</ul><br>
            These values can be combined. For example, if you have a monster that you want to appear
            ONLY in Hard, the spawnflags would be set to 256+512=768.

        <li><b>What are Detail brushes and when should I use them?</b><br>

            Detail brushes are used to help speed up the compile time by &quot;hiding&quot; those
            brushes from the compilers. Since the QBSP compiler breaks up a brush if another
            brush intersects it, this means that a lot of brushes may be created. Detail brushes
            can be used for any brushes that do <b>not</b> block the player's line of site.<br>
            <br>
            This is taken from a text file included with the gamex86.dll source code. The author is
            John Carmack.<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>
            <i>The basic idea is that you should make all of the brushes that aren't major occluders
			into detail brushes. This lets the vis program ignore all of the little protrusions that
			never really block sight. Because of the factorial order of the vis algorithm, it is
			pretty easy to get a 10x speedup in vis time by making the non-essential brushes detail.
			This also gives a method to fight some of the errors that still occur in bsps. If polygons
			are dissapearing in the game, but they come back with &quot;r_novis 1&quot; set, then
			there is a vis error. This can usually be fixed by making more of the brushes between the
			problem viewpoint and the problem polygon into detail brushes.</i>

        <li><b>What are Clip brushes and when should I use them?</b><br>

            Clip brushes are often used to keep a player from getting stuck along a wall, floor or
            ceiling by any brushes that protrude from those surfaces. For example a light
            fixture or a column. There are two methods for using Clip brushes:<br>
            -Create a triangle and put it flush with the sides of the protruding object and another
            side on the wall. This allows the player to be &quot;moved out&quot; slightly when
            moving along the wall.<br>
            -Create a rectangle Clip brush that covers the whole length of the wall and is out far
            enough to cover the edges of the items sticking out of the wall.<br>
            Both methods were used in the original Id levels. Using Clip brushes is <strong>strongly</strong>
            recommended for multiplayer maps.
