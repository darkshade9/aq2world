<h3>Gary Brigadir</H3>
<B>NAME</B>: Gary Brigadir<br>
<B>ALIAS</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;"kol" (don’t know &amp; don’t care if it means something)<br>
<hr noshade color="black"><br>
<B>BIOGRAPHY</B><br><br>
<B><I> - DESCRIPTION: </I></B><br>
White Male, age 16 to 17, about 55 Kg, of nervous &amp; erratic disposition.<br><br>
<!--break-->
Personality tests pin me down as an "introvert", "Spontaneous", "Strategist?" Go figure... I hate most things, but in time get emotionally attached to anything (like my aging 4MB 3d card that I just can't throw away *sniff*)<br><br>
By day, I’m the &quot;friend of a friend&quot; who’d point you in the direction of recreational drugs, tell you crap jokes with puns and be really bored / boring, and by night, I’m pretty much the same –  only sleepier.<br><br>

<B><I> - MAPPING INTERESTS</i>:</b><br>
All.<br>
All mapping interests me.<br>
And I like constructing various Industrial and Sci-Fi environments where there is a lot of room for different props, strange architecture, set pieces, machines and lots of stuff you can have fun and interact with.<br>
Recently I’ve been trying to make a few city maps like in kingpin.<br><br>
<B><I> - SKILLS</I>:</b><br>
All Games based on Quake style engines: System Shock 2, Kingpin, Quake (duh), and Half-Life of course.<br>
WordPad (Superior to Notepad)<br>
Hammer / Worldcraft 3.x<br>
A multitude of third party tools like Wally, Sprite explorer, PakScape, too many to list...<br>
Adobe Photoshop 6<br>
Macromedia Homesite 5.5 (For my lovely website)<br>
Goldwave v5.08<br><br>
A working knowledge of (working as in: Can do, but I'd rather avoid them):<br>
Microsoft Internet Explorer<br>
Windows XP<br>
3d Studio MAX 6<br><br>
<B><I> - OTHER</I>:</B><br>
I started mapping for HL when i got the Uplink demo from a bonus CD from one of those strange PC magazines. I found out that you could make your own maps, and captivated by the tiny screenshot of Worldcraft with a little view of a map, I went off in search of the editor (even though I didn't have the game yet). I found the thing, but got scared away by the sheer amount of things you needed to have from the game. So after a while the game turned up and it all went off from there.<br><br>
I begun seriously pushing my level design abilities when I started work on Hard-Liqueur, AKA: Subzone.<br>
Now I’m attempting to replicate the level of detail seen in Nightwatch, Dark Truths, and HL: Isolation. So far so good?<br><br>
Once I rid my psyche of laziness I'll produce a death match map to shoot my father and brother in, get a job, save up loads a money, and blow it all on a brand new PC and expand my mapping to HL2 and Doom3, and Quake4. At least, that's something I just came up with... we'll see.<br>
Oh, and once I get the opportunity, I go off on a really long rant and fuel my own insane... Individuality.. err.. Arrogance.<br><br>
<hr noshade color="black"><br>
<B>PORTFOLIO</B><br><br>
<B><I> - WORK</I>:</b><br>
First Project was Hard-Liqueur, never got off the ground... Then Came along a news post in the spirit site about issues - first impressions and lack of activity suggested that they were desperate and would probably have me on board.<br><br>
That's when i decided I'd release something - that gave birth to Subzone. My little one map contribution soon expanded onto one of the largest map sets for issues, bending the 3 map limit a bit.<br> Heheh &gt;:)<br><br>

Right now I'm working on Coil, a (so far) small map pack what aims to go just under the limit of hl's game engine, and be fun to play, and look Purdy.<br><br>

<B><I> - MODS AND LEVELS</I>:</B><br>
I've only released one: Subzone, and you can find that as part of Issues:<br>
<a href="http://www.issues.command-center.org/">Issues Command Center</A><br><br>
I’ve been involved in other projects also,<br>
One of them being "The Project" I was instrumental in its creation and ultimate demise... more demise than creation actually. All evidence of the project was wiped off the face of as-host servers long ago.<br><br>
I tried getting involved with several other mods, but I generally lost interest before I even tried to join, or the mod fell apart before I could make a good example of my work.<br><br>
<B><I> - MODELS</I>:</B><br>
 None released, but I'm poking around Milkshape and making a few props here and there.<br><br>
<B><I> - TEXTURES</i>:</B><br>
 I have created a few textures for my own levels, but my skills only go as far as making my own lights, signs, borders, "detail" textures etc. Nothing substantial, so there are none to download or look at.<br><br>
<B><I> - TUTORIALS</I>:</B><br>
I wrote a petty little level change tutorial for TWHL, then my writing days died down a bit...<br>
Until the project started - I wrote a few things for that:<br><br>
These included a guide to detailing Vents, Rooms and erratic e-mails detailing various concepts and options sent to Andy, the main man behind the thing.. But sadly, they are all gone. It’s probably for the better; as I was talking about stuff I never had experience in, just theory...<br><br>
Recently, my writing is starting up again -<br> I wrote some <a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/book/view/606">Generic Level Design Tips</a> and one or two truncated theoretical mapping tutorials that came in the form of forum posts. Once I get those linguistics going I'll probably write up something more comprehensive.<br><br>
<B><I> - WEBSITES</I>:</B><br>
Just one, my cosy little place with 50MB capacity:<br>
<a href=" http://www.hlcore.uni.cc/">Half-Life Core</a><br><br>
<B><I> - OTHER</I>:</B><br>
Mapping for: a long time by my counts.<br>
All my work is Single Player Half-Life based.<br>
I wanted to do some Kingpin and SystemShock2 stuff but never got the game and or resources.<br><br>
So far I haven't reached the stage where I can say "I'm a level designer by trade" I feel I haven't got enough experience or diversity, or releases for that.<br><br>
I like cake.<br>
And I also like pizzicato string quartets, lots of strange bands you never heard of, and food you’ll never taste.<br>
