<h3>Part One</h3>
This tutorial will demonstrate the procedures that need be taken to make a perfect a arch. Ok, first you'll need to be in the <font color="#ff6600">XY TOP</font> view in the editor.<br><br>
Now make a brush and size it to the length of the arch you want. I went <font color="#ff6600">312 x 64.</font>
<br><br>
Go to the <font color="#ff6600">Curve</font> menu and select <font color="#ff6600">More Cylinders/Square Cylinder</font>.
<br><br>
<div align=center><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch/q3Arch_PIC01.jpg"></div> Next, <b>WITHOUT</b> 
unselecting the Square Cylinder, change to the <font color="#ff6600">YZ SIDE</font> 
view so you can see the rows of the Cylinder. <br>
<br>
You'll notice that there are <font color="#ff6600">6 Rows</font> from top to bottom.
<br><br>
You'll want to add another set of Rows to this Square Cylinder - You'll see why in a minute.
<br><br>
Now go to the <font color="#ff6600">Curve</font> menu again and select <font color="#ff6600">Insert/Insert (2) Rows</font>.
<br><br>
<div align=center><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch/q3Arch_PIC02.jpg"></div>
<br><br>
A little explanation of Rows &amp; Columns is that <i>Rows</i> go the length of the brush and <i>Columns</i> go around the brush, so you'll have <font color="#ff6600">6 Rows</font> and <font color="#ff6600">24 Columns</font> in a default Square Cylinder. You'll see here that there are now <font color="#ff6600">12 Rows</font> now.
<br><br>
Again, without deselecting the Square Cylinder,	go to the <font color="#ff6600">Curve</font> menu and select <font color="#ff6600">Matrix/Re-disperse/Rows</font>.<br><br>
<div align=center><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch/q3Arch_PIC03.jpg"></div>
<br><br>
This is what the Square Cylinder looks like after you select the <font color="#ff6600">Matrix/Re-disperse/Rows</font> from the <font color="#ff6600">Curve</font> menu.
<br><br>
This makes the Square Cylinder have the proper shape when bending.
<br><br>
Now save your map so you don't lose any of this. I've messed up many of these and had to start all over again.
<br><br>
<div align=center><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch/q3Arch_PIC04.jpg"></div>
<br><br>
What I do is after I get this far, before trying to bend it, I'll make a copy of the Square Cylinder so I don't have to redo it all again.<br>
After you get this down, though, you won't have to be so worried about messing up.  Now, stretch the Square Cylinder to make it longer.
<br><br>
Figure out about how long you'll be needing it to make the curve.<br>It doesn't matter a whole lot what length it is right now, it's just easier to use this way.
<br><br>
You can resize it to the correct size later.
<br><br>
Now, from the Button Bar, with the Square Cylinder still highlighted,  select the <font color="#ff6600">Patch Bend Mode</font> button. <font color="Red">The Red Arrow</font>.<br>
After selecting it the Information window will pop up. This tells you what to do.
<br><br>
<div align=center><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch/q3Arch_PIC05.jpg"></div><br><br>
Ok, this is where this gets tricky. Bare with me. This is where you will choose what point the Square Cylinder is bent from. I circled the <font color="#ff6600">Bend Axis</font> dots, this is where the Square Cylinder bends.
<br><br>
You use the Tab button on your keyboard to cycle thru the available <font color="#ff6600">Bend Axis</font>. When you get to the point where you want to bend it from, hit enter to select that point.
<br><br>
You shouldn't have to 'Tab' thru them. The first point should look like the picture with the <font color="#ff6600">Bend Axis</font> at the correct point. If they are not like the picture, 'Tab' thru and get them at the first point that looks like the picture.
<br><br>
When you get the <font color="#ff6600">Bend Axis</font> at the point in the picture, hit enter 'Only once', then change back to the <font color="#ff6600">XY TOP</font> view.Now you should see a blue dot as one of the Bend Axis points.<br>
the picture to the left of the top two shows what you should be looking at.
<br><br>
This blue dot is the another bending point for the Square Cylinder.
<br><br>
From here, you'll use the 'Tab' button again to move the blue dot around to the center dot of the side that will be bent. The picture to the right of the top two shows how it should look.
<br><br>
Now switch to the <font color="#ff6600">XZ FRONT</font> view and change the grid to <font color="#ff6600">Grid1</font>.<br>
Take your mouse and bend the Square Cylinder until the end of it is perfectly squared with the grid lines. This is VERY important.<br>
You'll probably have to zoom in to see this. I have to any ways.
<br><br>
The bottom picture shows what it should look like.
<br><br>
Now, save your work!!
<br><br>
<div align=center><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch/q3Arch_PIC06a.jpg">&nbsp;<img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch/q3Arch_PIC06b.jpg"></div><br><br>
<div align=center><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch/q3Arch_PIC06c.jpg"></div><br><br>
Next, hit ESCAPE to unselect the Square Cylinder.<br>
We'll have to go thru the steps to select the Bend Axis again.
<br><br>
Hit the Bend Axis button again and 'Tab' to the next point in the SquareCylinder. The top picture shows what you should be looking at. Hit enter, only once, to lock it in and move the blue dot around again to the same point as in the previous bend.
<br><br>
<div align=center><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch/q3Arch_PIC07.jpg"></div>
<br><br>
<div align=center><img src="/content/quake3/tutorials/arch/q3Arch_PIC08.jpg"></div>
<br><br>
Make certain that your grid is set to <font color="#ff6600">Grid1</font> again.
<br><br>
Now bend this other end until the end of it is perfectly squared with the grid lines. Again this is 'VERY' important.
<br><br>
Your Square Cylinder should look like the bottom picture. Both ends of the Square Cylinder should be perfectly in line on 'ONE' grid line. If it is not, you've done something wrong and will have to correct it before proceeding.<br><br>
Right now, your Square Cylinder should be an arch. Upside down, but this is ok for now. If everything is correct, we can proceed after you save your work, of coarse.
<br><br>
