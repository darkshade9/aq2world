<b>Rust:</b> First of all, tell us a little bit about yourself and your position at Digital Extremes.
<br><br>
<b>Scott:</b> My name is Scott McGregor and I have been a level designer at DE for the last 7 months.
<br><br>
 
<b>Rust:</b> Has working as a professional in the gaming industry changed your views of gaming at all?
<br><br>
<b>Scott:</b> I find my self analyzing games more trying to figure out what makes them tick and why they are fun.
<br><br> 

<b>Rust:</b> What do you feel is the most important part of level design?
<br><br> 
<b>Scott:</b> Making it believable. If the player does feel like he belongs in the environment then I haven't done my job. This includes all aspects I guess, lighting texturing effects. Its all becoming more and more important.
<br><br> 

<b>Rust:</b> What limitations do you feel hurt you the most when designing game levels?
<br><br>
<b>Scott:</b> I guess the limits of the engine is the biggest limitation. I have worked with the entire quake series along with Unreal Championship. I find I am always fighting with the engine to get what I envisioned.
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> As professionals in the industry, what is the most common mistake you see in amateur maps?  What’s a common mistake you see other professionals make?
<br><br>
<b>Scott:</b> Probably the importance of lighting. I find alot of amatuer maps don't pay enough attention to lighting.
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> When it comes down to pre-planning your levels, what do you do?
<br><br>
<b>Scott:</b> Draw, dream, stare a blank grid.
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> What first sparked your interested in becoming a level designer in the game industry?
<br><br> 
<b>Scott:</b> Level design is has been a hobby of mine for a while now. About three years ago I visited DE with a buddy. We came up to test unreal. Well ever since that visit I have been working on my skills and here I am.
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> What were you doing before you worked at Digital Extremes? What do you envision yourself doing after your stint at Digital Extremes?
<br><br>
<b>Scott:</b> You mean there life beyond DE?...
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> While you’re not designing games, what are you doing in your spare time?
<br><br>
<b>Scott:</b> Spending time with my Girlfriend, relaxing and not looking at a computer.
<br><br>

<b>Rust:</b> What sources do you use for inspiration? 
<br><br>
<b>Scott:</b> Everything......... eventually you walk around and all you think about is your next or current map.
