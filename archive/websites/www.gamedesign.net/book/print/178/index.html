<h3>Half-Life</h3>
<blockquote>
		<b>func_breakable</b> - by <a href="mailto:stephen@segs.uwa.edu.au">Gard</a>
</blockquote>
<br> <br>

  <p>This entity allows you to create a breakable brush, and is a useful affect for 
     breaking glass, accidents and explosions.</p>

<hr noshade color="black">

<h3>Properties</h3>

      
  <p><b>Name</b> - A unique target name allows for a trigger, else for 
     the brush to break it will have be damaged (shot, chainsawed ... etc). 
     Set the Name if you want a trigger for an event.</p>

  <p><b>Target</b> - Often when a brush breaks you will want to activate 
     sound, another trigger ... etc. Target on break will activate that feature.</p>

  <p><b>Material Type</b> - This defines the material type, where:</p>

      <font color=red>
      <blockquote>
      0 - Glass</br>
      1 - Wood</br>
      2 - Metal</br>
      3 - Flesh</br>
      4 - Cinder Block</br>
      5 - Ceiling Tile</br>
      6 - Computer</br>
      7 - Unbreakable Glass</br>
      8 - Rocks</br>
      </blockquote>
      </font>

 <p><b>Strength</b> - Sets the amount of damage a brush will sustain before 
    breaking (unless a Name is set and trigger is used). Note that it is logical 
    to make stronger materials harder. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/tovanen/">Tovanen</a> 
    once suggested a value of 50 for wood, less for glass more for metal.</p>

 <p><b>Delay (before breaking)</b> - Sets the delay between the breaking of the brush and 
    by default flag properties (see below). Very useful for traps!</p>

 <p><b>Gib Model</b> - Spawned the gibmodel when the brush is broken.</p>

 <p><b>Spawn object</b> - Sets an item to be spawned when the brush is broken, options are:</p>

      <font color=red>
      <blockquote>
      0 - Nothing</br>
      1 - Battery</br>
      2 - Healthkit</br>
      3 - 9mm Handgun</br>
      4 - 9mm Clip</br>
      5 - Machine Gun</br>
      6 - Machine Gun Clip</br>
      7 - Machine Gun Grenades</br>
      8 - Shotgun</br>
      9 - Shotgun Shells</br>
      10 - Crossbow</br>
      11 - Crossbow Bolts</br>
      12 - 357</br>
      13 - 357 clip</br>
      14 - RPG</br>
      15 - RPG Clip</br>
      16 - Gauss clip</br>
      17 - Hand grenade</br>
      18 - Tripmine</br>
      19 - Satchel Charge</br>
      20 - Snark</br>
      21 - Hornet Gun</br>
      </blockquote>
      </font>

 <p><b>Explosion Magnitude</b> - This sets the size of the explosion 
    that will result from breaking the brush. A value of Zero will result in no explosion. 
    Breaking glass shouldn't have a explosion magnitude! </p>

 <p><b>Render Properties</b> - Sets the control the visual behavior of the object, 
    See Render Properties Tutorial (still to be written!)</p>

 <p><b>Flag Properties</b>- Set the entity event to break on</p>

      <font color=red>
      <blockquote>
      (1) Only Trigger - Trigger is activated</br>
      (2) Touch - Player touches</br>
      (4) Pressure - When any object touches</br>
      (256) Crowbar - When hit with a crowbar</br>

<h3>Half-Life</h3>
<blockquote>
		<b>func_button</b> - by <a href="mailto:stephen@segs.uwa.edu.au">Gard</a>
</blockquote>
<br> <br>

  <p>This entity allows you to create a button, such as a elevator button ... any button in the game. This function
     is typically used to trigger an event when it is touched or "used" by a player. 
     Once activated a Func_button will move in the direction set by an angle, for 
     a distance equal to its own length. Which gives the affect of a button being 
     pushed!</p>

<hr noshade color="black">

<h3>Properties</h3>

  <p><b>Name</b> - If a name, or target name, is assigned to a func_button entity, 
     it can be activated by any trigger_ function. Name defines a unique identity to
     any func_button.</p>

  <p><b>Render Properties</b>  - Sets the control the visual behavior of the object, 
    See Render Properties Tutorial (still to be written!)</p>

  <p><b>Speed</b> - This defines the rate a func_button will move from the inactivated to 
     activate position.</p>

  <p><b>Targeted object</b> - Sets the event that will be activated when a button
     is Flagged (see flags below)</p>

  <p><b>Health</b> - If a non zero value is set here the func_button has to be 
     shot/damaged rather than touched or used (flags are negated). When the button health
     reaches zero the target object will be activated.</p>

  <p><b>Master</b> - Multisource master option (tutorial to be written ... sorry)</p>

  <p><b>Wait</b> - Defines the time between switching between on and off. This is useful
     if you have a scripted sequence running, and don't wont the sequence to be restarted/
     interrupted</p>

  <p><b>Delay</b> - Defines the delay between when the func_button is touched or used and 
     the target object is activated.</p>

  <p><b>Flags</b> - There are a four button flags behaviors, these are:</p>

      
      <blockquote>
      <b><font color=red>(1) Don't move</font></b> - When enabled, the button will jump from inactive to 
      activated without moving,</br> 
      <b><font color=red>(32) Toggle</font></b> - When enabled, the button moves in and out. The user has 
      to press again to switch been active and inactive. The targeted object is
      activated everytime the button is toggled.</br> 
      <b><font color=red>(64) Sparks</font></b> - When enabled sparks are generated when the button is
      inactive.</br> 
      <b><font color=red>(256) Touch</font></b> - When enabled, the button is activated by a 
      players touch, and does not require the "<i>use</i>" key.</br>

 <p><b>Notes</b>:<br>
For this entity to actually look like it's moving, you need to use a texture with 'scroll' in its name (like 'scrollwater1').<br>
Set the texture's angle to the direction of the conveyor's movement (the texture will only scroll in its direction, not the conveyor's (so you can't make it move sideways unless the texture is rendered sideways).</p></ul><h1 id="310" name="310" class="book-h1">Func_door</h1><ul><!-- by Andy (andy_howard@bigpond.com) 2004 -->

 <p><b>Delay before close</b> - Delay before the door moves back to its closed position (-1 makes it stay open).</p>
 <p><b>Lip</b> - See Func_door, I am not sure why you would to change the Lip, as the 'Distance' property dictates the angle of swing....Unless you wanted it's Origin to move also?</p>
 <p><b>Damage inflicted when blocked</b> - How much damage the player receives if trapped in a closing door.</p>
 <p><b>Message</b> - Message if triggered.</p>
 <p><b>Target</b> - An entity named here will be triggered when the entity is activated.</p>

   <p><b>X Y Z - Move here after lighting</b> - From <a href="http://www.thewall.de">The Wall</a> and translated by Pepper:<br> The object will move to these coordinates after lighting. Usually the lightning around a rotating object is not good. It could be that a side is darkend, and that will look bad as the object rotates in game play. To solve this make a seperate room that is lit the way you want, select the coordinates you want the object to move to 'after it is initially lit' in your special room, and enter them under this property. As the game begins, the object will be lit in your special room, and then move to these coordinates. Check your grid alignment using the 2D windows.</p>
   <p><b>Damage inflicted when blocked</b> - If the player blocks the entity's movement, this amount of damage will be dealt.</p>

<blockquote>
 <font color=red>(1) Start On</font> Entity will start on (or active). This usually only has effect if the entity is given a name (most entities that aren't given names start on anyway), or has its Toggle flag set on.<br>
  <font color=red>(2) Reverse Direction </font> - Set this flag to make the brush turn in the opposite direction.<br>
  <font color=red>(4) X axis</font> - If enabled, the rotation will be in the X axis.<br>
  <font color=red>(8) Y axis </font> - If enabled, the rotation will be in the Y axis.<br>
  <font color=red>(16) Acc/Dcc</font> - If enabled, the entity will accelerate and decelerate from maximum speed based on the Friction property.<br>
  <font color=red> (32) Fan Pain</font> - With this enabled, the player will be hurt when coming into contact with the brush.<br>
  <font color=red>(64) Not Solid</font> - With this flag enabled, a brush-based entity will not be solid, so will not affect the player's movement in the way solid brushes do. Useful for things like moving laser targets that musn't obstruct the player.<br>
  <font color=red>(128) Small Radius</font> - Sets sound range to low.<br>
  <font color=red> (256) Medium Radius</font> - Sets sound range to medium.<br>

 <h3>Properties</h3>

<p><b>Name</b> - Can be activated by being triggered.</p>
 <p><b>Global Entity name</b> - The name of the Global controlling this button.</p>
 <p><b>Render FX</b> -  The options are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
        0 = Normal<br>
        1 = Slow Pulse<br>
        2 = Fast Pulse<br>
        3 = Slow Wide Pulse<br>

</blockquote>

 <p><b>Render Mode</b> -  Options are:</p>
<blockquote>
  0 = Normal<br>
  1 = Color<br>
  2 = Texture<br>
  3 = Glow<br>
  4 = Solid<br>
  5 = Additive <br>
</blockquote>

 <p><b>FX Amount</b> - The value of the Render Mode, between 0 and 255. <br>
  'Solid' mode simply needs a non '0' value to work, while in other modes  translucency is controlled by this value.</p>

 <p><b>FX Color</b> - An RGB value that controls the colour of the object  rendering. Only Color and Glow Render Modes use the Render Color property, but other entities also use it under different SmartEdit names.</p>

 <p><b>Pitch Roll Yaw</b> - Sets the pitch (up / down), yaw (left / right) and roll (bank) respectively. The compass in WorldCraft / Hammer corresponds to Yaw. The settings are not always (or not all) used.</p>
 <p><b>ZHLT Lightflags</b> - Set optional lightflags. Refer to ZHLTReference for more info.</p>
 <p><b>Light Origin Target</b> - Set optional light placement. Refer to ZHLTReference for more info.</p>
 <p><b>Targetted Object</b> - The event that the button will activate.</p>
 <p><b>Change Target Name</b> - </p>
 <p><b>Master</b> - The name of a multisource (or game_team_master) entity. A master must usually be active in order for the entity to work. Thus they act   almost like an on/off switch, in their simplest form, and like an AND gate in the case of the multisource.</p>
 <p><b>Speed</b> - How fast the button rotates when activated.</p>
 <p><b>Health</b> - If non-zero, the button must be damaged to this extent to activate it.</p>
<p><b>Sounds</b> - Values:</p>
<blockquote>
  21 = squeaky<br>
  22 = squeaky pneumatic<br>
  23 = ratchet groan<br>
  24 = clean ratchet<br>
  25 = gas clunk<br>
</blockquote>

 <p><b>Delay before reset</b> - Time to wait before button resets itself. <font color=red>-1</font> makes it stay set.</p>
 <p><b>Delay before trigger</b> - Usually the time in seconds before an entity should trigger its target (after being triggered itself).</p>
  <p><b>Distance</b> - Distance in degrees the button will rotate before activating its target.</p>
   <p><b>Minimum light level</b> - A Value > '0' will let this entity emit light, the range is '0' and '1'.</p>

<h3>Flags:</h3>

<blockquote>
 <font color=red>(1) Not solid</font> - With this flag enabled, a brush-based entity will not be solid, 
  so will not affect the player's movement in the way solid brushes do. Useful 
  for things like moving laser targets that musn't obstruct the player.<br>
<font color=red>(2) Reverse Direction</font> - Reverse rotation direction<br>
<font color=red>(32) Toggle</font> - Allows button to be toggled. Using the button toggles it between 
  'on' and 'off', each time retriggering its target. With this flag set on, an 
  entity can be turned on and off, either by the player, or by being triggered.<br>
 <font color=red>(64) X axis</font> - If enabled, the rotation will be on the X axis.<br>
<font color=red>(128) Y axis</font> - If enabled, the rotation will be in the Y axis.<br>
<font color=red>(256) Touch Activates</font> - The button can only be activated by the player bumping 
  into it (or by being shot, if Health is > 0).<br>

<p><b>Notes:</p></b>
 <p> After spawning, the func_train moves instantly to its First Stop Target path_corner. So the entity can be created in another area (and therefore lighting can be controlled), but it will always appear in the right place to 
  the player.<br>
  When making moving targets for things like env_laser, set Render Mode to Texture and Render Amount to 0, and enable the Not Solid flag.<br>
  No origin brush is required - the func_train aligns itself so that its centre is right over the centre of its path_corners.</p></ul><h1 id="336" name="336" class="book-h1">Func_traincontrols</h1><ul><!-- by Andy (andy_howard@bigpond.com) 2004 -->
