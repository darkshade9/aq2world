Here is my newest entry for pic of the day. I'm almost done 
my 1st Unreal level which is a scale model of the original 
Lasertag arena called Photon. <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~Mavronis/seismic/photon.htm">here</a> I 
have more screenshots in 640x480 and an 800x600 Windows 
Desktop Wallpaper version.
