We at rust are proud to offering free webpage hosting on gamedesign.net.
<br><br>
As you know rust deals mainly in the editing aspect of computer games. Therefore we are looking for hosted sites that also deal with the editing side of games. As of now our coverage is mainly the first person shooter style games, but we are looking to change that in the future. That's why we need your help. 

<br><br>
Here is what we offer to hosted sites:
<b><ul><li>?????.gamedesign.net domain(linux)</li>
<li>pop email account with @gamedesign.net email addresses.</li>
<li>Unlimited Web Space(within reason, not 15 copies of the sin demo)</li>
<li>FTP Space on <a href="http://www.telefragged.com" target="_top">Telefragged's</a> Server</li>
<li>Use of CGI, PHP, PostgreSQL, frontpage extensions(linux)</li>
<li>Log files of traffic</li>
</ul></b>
<br><br>
We at rust will also go out of our way to promote your site on the rust front page as well as our host <a href="http://www.telefragged.com" target="_top">Telefragged</a>.
<br><br>
For hosting inquiries, questions, comments email me at <a href="mailto:fishman@gamedesign.net">fishman@gamedesign.net</a> for for information or questions.
