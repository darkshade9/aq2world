<blockquote><blockquote>A remake of e1m5 " gloom keep " that should be out by the 31st. Its gonna use most of the original's textures,               as well as some q2 textures. Its gonna be enhanced for quake2 as well, colored lighting off the water, railgun               and other q2 items, and the single player q2 monsters! Am also working on a way to inlcude torches somehow, but               dont count on them being in thier :) The map will also inlcude q1 sounds and a special sky env as well. all of               which will nicely put into a pak file.</blockquote>Sent in by <a href="mailto:generaln@adelphia.net">General Nuke</a></blockquote>
