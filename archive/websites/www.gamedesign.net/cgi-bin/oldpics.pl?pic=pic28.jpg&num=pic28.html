<blockquote><blockquote>This is a 2 week old "work in progress" of my first level for Unreal so I could learn to use UnrealEd. I should be able to finish it in another week or so. It is a scale reproduction of the old Baltimore Photon lasertag arena from the 80's that I used to play. I invoked Ghost mode in Unreal to get a good overhead shot so you could get a feel for the level.  I hope to release this when it is done as both a Deathmatch and Botmatch level. It may not mean much to people who've never played the original Photon game but it sure brings back memories for me!
 
 Check out the Photon section from my Seismic Force <a href="http://members.xoom.com/mavronis" target="_top">webpage</a> for more information and screenshots including Photon for Quake2 and Doom2. Let me know what you think :)
