<blockquote><blockquote>The First Half-Life level released here. Based in a multi-story car
 park, this level contains lots of wide open areas, but still has plenty
 of ducking places to avoid that RPG attack... But don't hide there for
 too long, things can get a bit explosive!  =P
 <br><br>
 This was also the first ever level that I made using prefabs also,
 courtesy of <A href="http://hlprefabs.gamedesign.net">HLPrefabs</a> (but why bother making it yourself when someone
 else has already made it?). Download It <a href="http://rev.telefragged.com/halflife/ncp.shtml">Here</a></blockquote>Sent in by <a href="mailto:rev@io.com">Matt Davis(Rev)</a></blockquote>
