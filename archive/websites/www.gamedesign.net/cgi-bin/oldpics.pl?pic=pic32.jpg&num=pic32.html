<blockquote><blockquote>This is my first all original map. At least, the first one I plan on releasing. It is a strictly DM level. I made it to incorporate all the things we like best in a DM level at work. It has a large main area (shown in pic) which is surrounded by several smaller rooms which are all interconnected. There are no dead ends for players to get trapped in. It plays very well with our normal 4 players.
