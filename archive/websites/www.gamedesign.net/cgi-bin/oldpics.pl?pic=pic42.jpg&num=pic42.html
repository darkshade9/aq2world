<blockquote><blockquote>Here's my submission, for a level Called ReV's Fated which is a
 Deathmatch level that so far has had 130 hours of development, (most of
 my levels have taken about 30-40 hours). The base is built into the
 cliffs edge, with multi level access, and a fun very very high drop to
 the bottom level into a large pool of water. you can see some more
 screenshots at <a href="http://rev.telefragged.com/quake2/revfated.html" target="_top">ReV Central</a></blockquote>Sent in by <a href="mailto:rev@io.com">ReV</a></blockquote>
