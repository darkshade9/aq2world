<blockquote><blockquote>here is a map i wipped up just for the func_wall contraversy...
 all the rocks and light poasts(4) of them are func_ wall...
 there is also an exploding wall/ 2 head crabs and 2 alien slaves in the
 same room/vis area
 the r-speeds are below 300 and the only hint of slow down is when the
 explosion and wall are triggered
 now i wouldnt use the func_wall trick in multy player... only in single
 player where it will do no harm what so ever...and i run a pII 200 mhz
 machine from hell ... so if it works for me it should work for most...
 look for my single player episode "the great god pan" {arthur macken writen
 in the 30's}
