<blockquote><blockquote>I got alot of emails asking about the gloom keep remake pic that was posted here yesterday, so i 
 	      thought that alot of you would be interested in my other 2 remakes already complete.  the first of which is todays potd, q1dm4 " Bad Place " all the same features that are gonna be in the gloom map are in here. Colored lighting from the lava, q1 sound effects, q1 textures, etc. Hope you guys enjoy it :) will post the pic of q1dm3 " The Abandoned Base " soon. You can download this map <a href="http://bicnet.net/~jdolan/quakepage/q1xdm4.zip">here</a></blockquote>Sent in by <a href="mailto:generaln@adelphia.net">General Nuke</a></blockquote>
