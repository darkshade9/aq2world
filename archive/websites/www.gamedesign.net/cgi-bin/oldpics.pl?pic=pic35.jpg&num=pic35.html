<blockquote><blockquote>I've been working for a long time on this level but Real Life(tm) keeps interrupting. After months I finally have time again for my level which is based on a room of an earlier, never completed level -Hyperion- after the Babylon 5 ex-website and concequently named spaceship in the series. I hope to introduce some more 3d/height in DMlevels, something I am extremely fond of (I love Q2DM2). The level should go in alpha by years-end for some private playtesting but still needs a lot of work. I only hope work won't prevent me from finishing it because I work for at least 6 straight hours on a map per day, something I have trouble doing with a regular job.
