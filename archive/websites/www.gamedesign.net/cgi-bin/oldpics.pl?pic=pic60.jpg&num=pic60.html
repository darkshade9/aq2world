<blockquote><blockquote>This is a screenshot of a DM level, I was working on when starting level editing for Quake (my first level). With the knowledge about r_speeds and polycount that I got nowadays, this level seems to be unfinishable in a satisfying way. :O( .....the polycount in the crosswalk you see here "shoots" up to about 1300!!! ARRRGHH, I "love" vaults -in this single room there are 16(!) crossings of round vaults! So just see this as a deterrent example for all newbies in level-editing ..........but....doesn't it look great?!?</blockquote>Sent in by <a href="mailto:crid@gmx.de">CRID</a></blockquote>
