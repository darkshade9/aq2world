<blockquote><blockquote>This map is a level I am currently doing from request of a lot of people I have met. Simply put, create a model of the warrior bug from Starship Troopers, set it up as a player model, run a bot program controlling 20 of these things and then get all my mates and have a good old bug slaughter. Sound like fun? You bet when you see ten of these storming down a bug hole ready to tear you head off and then eat the goey insides...

 	The map I made for this war is quite, quite large, spanning nearly to 3000 units in each direction, and is filled with all the great things you saw in the movie, the armoured base where the mobile infantry got stormed by hundreds of bugs, the tunnels and nests and the open winding canyons that the poor troopers walked into while those flying bugs picked them off. But, simply put, i still need some help on it, so any willing and able map makers out there, drop me a line on <a href="mailto:Darkforce_st@hotmail.com">Darkforce_st@hotmail.com</a> because the map is only partially lit so far and lighting isn't my strongest point :)

 Well, thanks for taking a look,</blockquote>Sent in by <a href="mailto:jamontoast@bigpond.com">-=Fraggen=Hell=-</a></blockquote>
