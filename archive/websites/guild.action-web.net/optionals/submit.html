    <font size="-1" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before you submit your files to the Actors
    Guild please read the following guidelines to make this the most painless process for all
    involved parties.<br>
    </font><p><font size="-1" face="Arial">REQUIREMENTS:&nbsp; For your optional to be
    accepted to the Actor's Guild, it must meet the following requrements:<br>
    1.) Be your original work(read below for borrowed files)<br>
    2.) Include all the necessary files in .zip format<br>
    3.) In your zip there needs to be a pak9.pak file(must be WORKING).&nbsp; A readme.txt
    that includes the ORIGINAL author and email(icq optional) and instructions about where to
    extract the .zip and how to fix the .pak file also needs to be included.<br>
    4.) Please name the zip after the submitter and what type of file it is. (EX. If I sent in
    an MP5 skin, the .zip should be called actmarine_mp5.zip) I'm sure you get the idea.<br>
    5.) If any one of these requirements has not been met, I will ask you to fix whatever
    needs fixed, and to resubmit<br>
    <br>
    BE ORIGINAL: Dont take things from other games/mods and claim them to be your work, this
    can get us all in trouble. The big thing is models. Some sounds are okay, but models are a
    big NO NO.&nbsp; If you want to bring a model over from another game or mod, please get
    consent from the original author.&nbsp; Also include the name of the the author and
    his/her email in the readme for that specific file. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TAKE AND SUBMIT SCREENSHOTS!: I hate having to install every skin etc.
    just to make a screenshot for the page. Please take them yourselves. I ask that the
    largest dimension is 400 pixels max, JPEG, and under 30k. Also try to get a good lighting
    source. Urban3 has great lighting, it's really bright. All gunskins and weapon models
    should have pics included in the zip file.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WATCH SIZE: Please send an e-mail and ask before you send a huge file
    (500 k or more). If you are sending through icq (30883234) then filesize should not
    matter.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a skin is mapped wrong, I will ask you to fix it yourself. &nbsp; I
    don't have the time or knowledge to fix mistakes on your files. Please test your optionals
    before submitting them, if you need help ask before you submit the file.<br>
    <br>
    FINALLY: Submit your files to <a href="mailto:action_marine@hotmail.com">ActMarine</a> or
    icq them to me at 30883234.<br>
