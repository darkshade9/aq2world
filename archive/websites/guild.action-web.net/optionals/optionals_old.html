        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action Half-Life was released yesterday, hope you got it by now. I got in early and enjoyed a
        nice 5k a second off my 56k modem. As you may have read at the <A HREF="action.action-web.net">Action main page</A>
        the Guild will be housing everything for AHL that it did for AQ2, so send those gunskins, sounds, configs and all
        that jazz to me. The entire Actors Guild needs to be redone to accomodate AHL, but until that happens we have to
        cram the content in the current format somehow. Well, enough about AHL, let's get onto the submissions.<br>
        <br>My new favorite Englishman is Bloodlust, and he sends in another weapons pak. There's just no stopping this guy.
        He put in the readme that he doesn't want people taking credit for his work, by just editing his skins and then 
        submitting them. MeSSerSmitt sends in some sniper crosshairs that were inspired by ones used in WW2. Let's end
        with a rare submission, an icon pak. Ryan Corey sends us one based on the HUD systems used in military aircraft.<br>
        <br>Oh, yeah, Others section is up and running. So if you have any "Other" material that you think the rest of the
        community should have, SEND IT IN. Don't know what "Other" material is? GO LOOK!!!!

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just can't seem to whoop that CGF arse as well as I would like. And on top of it, it makes
        my q2 crash like a 16 year old girl driving a Dodge Viper (sorry to my female audience). Anyways, I got a lot
        of skins for you optionals followers. My man, your man, and the leader of my clan SpedDmn hits us hard with
        4 (yes, 2+2) optionals. This is unheard of as far as I know. 2 handcannon skins, 1 with black handle and chrome
        barrel and the other with a wood handle and darker silver barrel. 1 tactical shotgun and 1 sniper crosshair. He is
        just the man, and if he hadn't already won the SPOTU I would give it to him. Well, enough brown-nosing, I also 
        a really good sound pak from Kiribati. It takes the good from some previous pak's and he also adds his own personal
        sounds to it, making it one of the best weapon and misc sound pak's I have tried. Almost forgot, Silencer also 
        submitted a handcannon with the wood finish on it, very nice. It's funny, I was just thinking the other day that
        we needed more handcannon skins, and wala you guys come through.<br>
        <br> I might be getting some web help from Spawn, who has already done a lot of site work for us. He is gonna 
        try to get the others section up and running, so look for that soon. He also updated the sounds page for me. <br>
        <br>Was wrapping up the update and I got an email from Bloodlust. He asked me if I knew a program that converted
        mdl file to a md2. I think MeDdLe does it, but not sure. If anyone knows, please email me the program name. Thanks! 
        And remember, 7-29-99 is the day!!

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, so I took a week off from the Guild, so sue me. I had to work a lot, and had errands to run
        and whatnot. And Dungeon Keeper 2 RULES!! Anyways, as you would expect, you get quite a few optionals in 7 days, 
        so here they come. BRACE YO SELF! aEk.Eagle sent in a skin for the Ruger Hawk sniper pistol. One of my optionals 
        helpers,Vienese, sent in a MP5 skin that he has been working on for a while. =GP=MAMASBOY sent in a Sniper Rifle 
        skin. And Mr. KUK sends in a silver M4 skin with black handels and clip.<br>
        <br>Other files upped include 2 more crosshairs from D.O.A. and a sound pak from DeathDeala. Now onto the Shameless
        Plug of the Update. This updates award goes to Mr.Optionals himself, Bloodlust. He asked for me to plug his clansite,
        so <A HREF="http://members.xoom.com/dogsclan/">here it is</A>. He sent me files this update, but I can't post them yet,
        need to wait on the others section to be fully operational. About the Others page, please continue sending in "other"
        things even though they aren't being posted yet, they will get their time.<br>
        <br>I would like to thank everyone out there for not sending me any config files in the past few days. I hate writing the
        "Please refer to the submit files page about submitting configs, and how I won't post them anymore." For all of you CFG
        makers out there, I will be posting AHL configs, so get to work on those as soon as it is released. There are going
        to be plenty of things to bind, trust me :)

        is a first, we have 2 (yes, 1+1, very good) sound paks for ya to test out. [AMC]Inspecta sent in a weapon and
        misc. sound pak. The headshot is disgusting, I like it. The other was sent in by S. Kleye and they are for 
        the male and female models. Very cool! Next up we have weapon skins, and like usual Bloodlust has outdone
        himself and sent in a great selection of weapons. It has a new skin for each weapon in AQ2 (except for the cannon)
        and a new bullethole. Mr KUK also sent in a very cool M4 skin. D.O.A. sent in some more animated crosshairs, 
        and one of my optionals helpers, alexandr, sent in some crosshairs. Thanks for all the submissions. No
        "SPOTU" for this update, because people don't return emails!! I guess they don't want a shameless plug on
        a website with 250000+ hits. Oh well, less work for me. Over and out.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, another update. These are fun. I took down all the nav button. They took up a few K
        per page, so it should improve load time. They also are redundant, use the frame to navigate. I also got a
        submission, some animated crosshairs from D.O.A. I already plugged enough people today, so no more for now.
        Sorry it took so long to get the update from earlier finished. My FTP program got mad at me and wouldn't upload
        anything. It's up now though, so go download stuff. Oh, anyone really hate those CGF bots also? Is it just me 
        or do they ALWAYS know where you are. I jumped off a building and one of them shot me in mid air. Another time
        I jumped over a sniper and he shot me in mid air. And that damned Sabotage guy just shoots me in the head. I 
        rush him and <CRACK> Gigolo dies. Oh well, I took him out with the sniper rifle. Anyways, enough rambling. Oh,
        I got a question for all of yall out there. I am trying to make the site look better (took down nav buttons, etc.)
        and I need an opinion. Which optionals graphic is better? The on on top of this page, or the lighter one with the 
        crosshairs on all the other pages. Email me with your preference. I know which one I like, but if a lot of people like
        the lighter one I might keep it. That's all for now. Expect the others page soon.

        <br>Gunskins go first, cause they are just better, so NYAH! We got some tiger guns by ZIckBOne. He made a Shotgun and a Sniper 
        Rifle skin, with a tiger theme(got ahold of some bad acid eh?). And my favorite optional just got better, Kramed sent me
        an updated version of his gold akimbo pistols. Kramed is the man! I am gonna plug his little site really quick.<A HREF="http://aw.telefragged.com">Action World</A>.

		<BR>Ok, as if the plug for <A HREF="http://aw.telefragged.com">Action World</A> wasn't shameless enough, here we go for the OFFICIAL "Shameless Plug of the Update" and it

		in a St. Nic-like mood, so he gets his wish, only after sitting on my lap. That's a good boy. SpedDmn did the Submisions page, and he is gonna

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that much submitted in the past few days, but a lot of other things going on. The optionals
        site is growing. Thanks to ol Suislide (AKA ACTION GOD) I have a lot of work to do. I have to format a page to hold
        everything that is now currently supported. This is gonna be tough, but it will rock when it's done. The Others page
        is back, but different. It used to hold gunskins and weapon models, but now it is going to hold "other(TM)" things.
        All Action related of course. Any help with this new section would be much appreciated.<BR>
        <BR>Now on the subject of help, I am gonna give a shout out to my Optionals crew. I am going to start a "Shameless
        Plug of the Update" award to people who make my life a little easier, or harder. Now that sounds weird, so let me explain.
        To win, you can either help me out by doing site work, or submit some KICK @$$ $h1+.
        Unforgiven Spawn recently emailed me about helping me out, and I took him up on his offer. He did a lot of screenshots,
        making the "Gunskins" page pretty much complete. He gets the first ever "Shameless Plug of the Week" award.  Now for 
        Spawns shameless plug.<A HREF="http://www2.cytanet.com.cy/quake2/">CYTAnet Quake2 Players Page</A>.<BR>
        <BR>Now yes, I did get a few submissions, and here they are. [VfN]HaKA sent in some regular crosshairs and MadMan 
        sent in a smiley face laser sight. Damn you people are sick. Well, that be it for now. Oh, I updated the demos section,
        check it out.<br>
        <br>I might hold a Weapon Model contest, to go along with the Player Model contest held by the A-Team. This is still 
        in the works, and just really an idea of mine, so email me if you would like to help in anyway. That's all for now.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wooooo, bring on the optionals. No BS, let's jump right in. First up we have a laser sight based on the predator series, done by Blackman, 
        probably the busiest optioanls guy. The second is a slanted crosshair from He@d-RipPeR. Then there is a 
        crosshair that is "Used for shootin dork�s in da head", according to its author, sCiEnCe. Our final crosshair 
        is for your sniper rifle. Xenian brings us some sniper x-hairs inspired by "Saving Private Ryan". Now onto the 
        gun skins. Bloodlust decided to bomb my email box with skins, so how can I complain  :) He sends in 2 mp5 skins, 
        each with a different fire theme. He also sent in a fire sniper rifle. GermanFF sent in a camo mp5 skin. And that 
        pesky Blackman sent in a "Sniper's Sniper skin" as he calls it. And last, and the largest file I recieved, it s 
        sound pak from KwazyDog.<br>
        <br>Now time for 2 rants. First is on the Optionals page holding Config Files. I have no problem keeping em up, 
        they might help some people. But let's face it, just about every combo has been tried. I will probably not be 
        posting any new config files. For those of you that can't think up original config ideas, there will be a fix 
        for that shortly. I can't quite tell you what it is yet, but when we get it we will let you know :)<br>
        <br>My second rant is on submitting ANYTHING from other games, mods, programs, anything. I mean sounds, 
        models, skins, anything. Only original work will be posted from here on out. Now there might be a few exceptions, 
        but email me if you are unsure. The big thing is models.<br>
        <br>Ok, let's recap. Do not submit configs unless they are amazing. Do not submit anything from other mods. Do 
        submit original work. Now some site news. I might start a custom pak section. Some people have sent in 
        their custom paks with their sounds, skins etc. Now these are really large normally, so I am kind of against it, 
        but we will see. I am also really close to starting work on the new sounds page, which is going to be really useful.
        That's it for now!!

        those are, don't worry about it. Anyways, I got like 20 optionals, so I will work on that update late into the night.
        I am only working 3 days a week now, so more time for webpages!! Thanks again everyone. Oh, and look for that optionals update
        later on today or tomorrow. Almost forgot, those of you who want my first born child, send a SASE to me, and I will
        send my kid ASAP. I will even cover the S&H fees, ain't I a nice guy?

        It was the "-.0222" thing, thanks for the help!! Now onto the optionals. The big news is
        an animated crosshair. It is the first for Quake 2 I believe, and it comes to us from Weird 1. It is really cool,
        so download it NOW! Hmmmm, what else do I have for ya? How about a sniper crosshair based one from Judge Dredd, sent in by Blackman.
        There is also a sniper crosshair sent in by [R7]ZappaH that has a really nice look to it. Our final crosshair comes from 
        Pimpitron, who sends in a crosshair pak, with 3 crosshairs and 1 sniper crosshair. One of the crosshairs is an akimbo specific 
        crosshair, so check that one out. Now don't worry, I got more for ya. Mr. Postal sent in a m16 skin that doesn't have the 
        bright bullets. And lastly, and leastly :), Mamas Boy shares his autoexec and team configs with us.<br>
        <br>Now for another little rant. When people send in gunskins, please include a pic. If you want the specs and everthing
        that I use, please email me. It takes me quite a bit of time to take pics of skins, then cut and paste em together, 
        and it would just be easier if the author would do that for me. With that said, KEEP SENDIN IN THE SKINS!!

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You people never seem to amaze me. Today as I was checkin the old email box, I noticed
        that someone sent me a HUGE file. Well it turned out to be a 5 meg sound pak, with custom sounds for each
        player model. Yep, you heard me, sounds for the Messiah, ActionRally, we got em all baby. A big thanks to 
        Massive Bitch for that submission. Oh, forgot his disclaimer:"*NOTE: Some sounds not suitable for children.*" 
        One more note, he didn't make all the sounds, he used some from places, but it still rocks. Get that over 
        at the soon to be redone sounds page. Ok, what else did we get. Bloodlust sent me his personal pak file, 
        and I will post it once we get the optionals "others" page done. That is going to house "Other" things, 
        like the AQ2 winamp skin and player pak files. Well, I will keep this update shorter than the last 2, so 
        thats all for 2nite. Uh, one more thing. Big Fat Ando has an idea for a Res Dog movie for AQ2. Nothing is 
        set yet, but if you want to star, help out, whatever, then give me an email. Ablee Ablee Ablee that's all folks.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I even try to match yesterdays update, well I will try. I recieved a sniper 
        crosshair from Alexander. It fixes a previous crosshair that he made a few months ago, go check it out.
		I also got a demo that was "made just for me" from Big Fat Ando. It's kind of creepy, you will have to watch the demo. 
		It is called <a href="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/guild/demos/headshot.zip">Headshot</a>. 
		I wonder if it is a death threat. It's small, and a cool idea, well, if it isn't a death threat and all. 
		And finally, I talked to Suislide about gun skins in AHL, and things don't look good.
		For some oddball reason (is oddball 1 word or 2?) Valve decided to do models like Quake1. The skin is 
		embedded in the model. So for each gunskin you will have to download the whole model. There are obvious 
		benefits and drawbacks to this, so we will have to live with it. If you want more info on this email me.
		One last tidbit, it has come to my attention that Muz's m16 was actually an m60. It is just a misnomer on his part. 
		Well, that's all for now. Oh, one more thing, GO SPURS!

		<FONT COLOR=#808080>
		Damn, AHL skin submissions are going to kill my email box. Oh well, by then I should have cable modem.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of goodies today kiddies. First up we got Blackman submitting two 
	new skins. The first is a bloody knife skin, and the second is a cool akimbo skin. Really can't 
	describe it, so check it out. Next up is Frost who has sent us a crosshair that aids in knife throwing!
	I am interested in seeing if this helps anyone, so if you use it and love it, gimme an email. [KGB]_Kaya 
	also submits 3 crosshairs that are more visible. Now for the 2 biggies. Bloodlust sends in a glock pistol 
	modified from the Terror Quake mod. It even comes with a custom icon. I would really like to see an akimbo 
	model for this glock. And finally.....[-ZeUs0-] has fixed the M16 model that muz submitted a while back. 
	It is really good. New sounds and some great skinning make it a must have.<br>
	<br>Thanks to everyone that has offered to help out. I think I have enough people, but if you really think
	that you can help out, then by all means send me an email. I am looking for some really good HTML guys to 
	help me redo the sounds page. It needs it, and I got some idears in this ol noggin of mine.<br>
	<br>Before I end this post, I have a plee for help. Somewhere in my config it makes my mouse inverted. It 
	is a pain to have to go through the options menu everytime I play AQ2. If someone knows the console command 
	to make my mouse NOT INVERTED, then please tell me, thanks. Thats all for now.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got some good news, and a rant. First, The Saint sends us a really kick 
	ass knife model. It has a new attack animation, and it looks really good. There is also a new
	sniper config sent in by Dave Huppertz. <br> 
	<br>Now for the rant. I love to check my email and see new 
	model submissions. What really gets me mad is when someone sends in a model that doesn't work. 
	The most common fault is in the skinning. I only have a 46.6 kbps connection, so it takes a 
	while to download 3 megs of email. I would appreciate it if you would TEST your skins before 
	sending them in. This would save me a lot of time in email checking, and in testing.<br>
	<br> With that said, we will hopefully have eXXon's Anaconda Sniper Pistol and a Swedish AK5 from Ladida pretty 
	soon. <A HREF="http://guild.telefragged.com/optionals/images/anaconda01.jpg">Here is a teaser from eXXon.</A> 
	Thanks to those who have written to me and expressed interest in helping with the guild. 
	We need a few more, so if you are interested, gimme a buzz.That's all folks.
