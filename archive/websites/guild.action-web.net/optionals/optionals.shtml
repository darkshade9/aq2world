I have been SO UNBELIEVABLY BUSY with real life, school, and other stuff that I haven't been able to devote the needed time to the Guild. But without further ado, I bring the files. <br><br>We sure don't get a lot of these, and it's a shame. A weapon repleacement model!! ~MP*Canus sends in a cool looking MAC-10 model, originally from Navy Fortress. He got the persmission to post it here, so it's cool. No gunskins for a change, but as soon as I get a pic of the 24K Pimp pak, it's gonna be posted.<br><br>Crosshairs galore!! I actually have about 10 more on my HD but they don't have screenies, so I probably won't even post them. This is how serious I am about sending in pics people. DO IT! Blitz and [mG]-Organ sent in crosshair paks. Infection=NASA= sent in a sniper hair while {FOO}Schtoos sent in an x-hair. Phixius sent in a AHL Windows icon and SureshoT sent in an in game AQ2 icons pak.<br><br> 2 new sound paks, one from White Wolf and the other from Susano-[MacH]. We also have a new section to the others page, Music. Yes, we have an AQ2 inspired song. Everyone I sent it to liked it, and I did also. It's in MP3 format and relitively small (2.5 megs) so give it a listen. I also have some demos, and I will try to upload those ASAP.<br><br>Rant of the update: SUBMIT PICS!! I can't stress this enough, you don't send a screenshot of your work, you might not make the update. I don't have the time to weed through 15 pak files, extracting the targa files into PSP and then format em to JPEG. It's easy to do, but takes a lot of time. I am also doing the section solo again, so if anyone has free time, send in those emails sayin that you want to help me out. That's all for today.<FONT COLOR=#808080>Real reasons for no update: trip to Austin, excessive alcohol consumption, girls, parties, and overall laziness.

He@d-RipPeR sent me 4 crosshairs, 2 sniper and 2 normal. We also got a sniper hair from s3ntry. And lasty, and possibly leastly (KIDDING), p1n0yb0y sends in a windows icon pak for AHL and AQ2. Nice work!!<br><br>Hmmmmmm, anything worth ranting about? Lemme think. Oh, things are getting a little backed up here at the ol Guild as far as optionals go.

Now there is no way I am gonna do all these shots, and with Spawn out of town they probably won't get done. Those of you that didn't send a screenie will get emails, and those of you that did, thank you. The Guild is a FREE site that posts YOUR work. Look at us as a store. Everyone that submits to the guild wants people to download their work and marvel at its awesomeness and use it and love it, etc. Well that won't happen if you don't show them what it looks like. I am okay at writing descriptions for the skins, etc, but as they say a picture is worth a thousand words. For now, all this update is is a rant. I got all the files renamed, and in order, etc. I will probably upload them in a sec and wait to do all the HTML work tomorrow, I think Spawn will be back home by then. Long rant, that's all for now.<FONT COLOR=#808080>You know what sucks? My ref_gl.dll won't allow me to play multi-player q2, but on an empty server or on my own server I can play fine.

It is based off of the Austin Powers movie, and is quite odd. Go check it out. And lastly the sound submissions. We have the first compiled AHL sound pak, featuring some new weapon sounds by Zer0.<br> <br>Shameless Plug of the Update goes to............. Kiribati. Check out his site <A HREF="http://kiribatisworld.jumpgames.com/">Kiribatis World</A>. Other news. Zeus0 sent me some sprite programs, I will put those in the Developers Area. It is linked on the frame. For the uninformed, AHL uses sprites for the crosshairs. What else, Oh, very important!! DO NOT SUBMIT FILES TO MY EMAIL (samm@texas.net) ANYMORE!! Spawn is gonna start helping me with updates, and you need to send the files here : submit2guild@starlynx.com . That will send them to me and him. If you submit files to me directly (samm@texas.net) I cannon promise that they will be updated. This makes things for me about 100x easier, so sorry for the small inconvienence to those of you who send me stuff. Well, I'm out. School starts tomorrow. SENIOR YEAR!!!!!! <FONT COLOR=#808080> I have a big day of picking on freshman tomorrow, let me sleep  :)</font></td></tr></table>

I got 29 emails, haven't even looked at em yet (still downloading) and I got tons of ICQ messages (and a lot of URL's of those porno banner sites, please stop sending those whoever you are) and I am sorry for being gone. Real life stepped in in a big way, just didn't have the time or energy to do any work. With that said, this update is just a way of me saying that I am not dead or anything, just took some time off. I won't upload anything 2nite, I have to get up early and drive to Austin and do more real life stuff. School also starts for me on the 10th, so that will cut on my time as well. I know I can slack off senior year, but with 7 classes a semester, I gotta do a little work  :) Email just stopped downloading, and it looks like TONS of crosshairs and some AHL stuff. Some gunskins as well. Oh, about the others page. I know I said it was up, and it isn't, so just wait a little longer. Some stuff that was supposed to go in there it turns out doesn't work or is incomplete, so just gimme some time. Also, if anyone knows how to convert files into a sprite, please email me. AHL uses sprites to do crosshairs and I (along with most of you) have some ideas for some crosshairs for AHL. So if you know how to do sprites, convert them, whatever, hook it up! Well, I have rambled enough, hope to do an update later on today or Monday.<br><FONT COLOR=#808080>Anyone else play AHL on a LAN and see how fucking slow it is? It is insane. Even Fragdock sucked ass. There's a bug for ya Suislide.</FONT></font></td></tr></table>
