// Copy this and paste it into your config file.
// This setup will allow you to zoom both in and out with the sniper
// rifle.  Also, the mouse sensitivity is adjusted to allow for better
// aim.  Change the values as you see fit (especially the 10, which is
// the sensitivity for the normal view).
