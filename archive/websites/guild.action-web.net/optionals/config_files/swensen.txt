// Hey there,
// These are my personal AQ2 settings. They work perfect and conclude
// the latest bindings from AQ2 version 1.5. Before you start playing,
// change a few things first! You'll have to change the sensitivity
// bindings to which number you prefer, and you'll have to put in 
// your name here and there. =) I've tried to make this as easy to use
// and edit as possible, so HAVE FUN!
//
// 	        Still have troubles, question, complains or suggestions?
// 	                      Feel free to email or ICQ me!

//                     Please tmail them to me! I love new stuff to use!
