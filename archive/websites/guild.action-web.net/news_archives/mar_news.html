					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, we're starting to make the site easier for all of you.  The skins section has been re-organized a litle.  If you need a current model and all of its skins, there is a link at the bottom of the CURRENT SKINS page for that model.  Also, the new skins for you guys to vote on are now organized by model type as well, because it makes more sense.  Your suggestions are being heard!!!

<br> 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I just recieved a vwep patch for the McClane model that I will post after I get a chance to review it.  Brought to you by kramed and the folks at the <a href="http://aq2og.telefragged.com/">Action Quake Owner's Guide</a> <br>  <a href="http://aq2og.telefragged.com/mcclane/">Here's some screenshots of it.</a>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allright, things are really moving here at the guild.
We've got 10 more skins for you to <a href="skins/skins_beta.html">vote on over at the skins section</a>.  Tha models section has two new models, as well as damage
location charts for some of the existing models.  In addition, we now have our <a href="models/modelinfo.html">basic requirements</a> page for the submitted models.
Moving on to the optionals section we have new sound packs, in game icon replacements, and tons more stuff for you to customize your action quake.
The demos section has a new installment of the <a href="demos/bible.html">action bible</a> with kumanru, monastery, and rh_city jumps.  One day I need to have Kissmet show
me how to do that.  And last, but certainly not least, is the developer's section which has more tutorials on modeling, two guide for snipers, and some generally cool strategies for playing action.

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a little surprise for everyone.  It is a fully animated preview of the Actionrally model we received.  This is the the version I said I would release on the main AQ page so that people could skin her with some Action themed skins.  I do NOT want to see this little beauty on servers yet.  I am only releasing one set of arms (which means no vwep in this release) and I am trusting people not to abuse this.  If you want to skin the model then by all means grab this little 500k file and plug away.  The sooner we get some good skins the sooner the real version will be released.  Also, if you just want to see the model but don't want to actually skin her then you can of course grab her too as long as she doesn't start appearing on servers.  Nobody would be able to see who you were anyways so it would be dumb to use her now.  She has varms (like the M model already released) which means that you can skin any part of her body except for her arms.  The skin on the arms has to stay the same since her arms are actually part of the weapon model and not the player model.  She has an anime skin that came with her but since Anime does not fit the theme (usually doesn't) please do not try to make small changes and use this skin as a base.  She needs to be made to look more realistic and less like a cartoon.  Um..  That's about it.  Just spread the word to anyone you know is a skinner so we can get some sweet skins for this sweet model.  Enough talk, <a href="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/guild/models/skinthisrally.zip">CLICK HERE to get the model</a>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, after a long time struggling with all
					these submissions I'm finally all caught-up, thanks to all the new
					Actor's Guild staffers who have been generously giving their time to
					this noble cause.  I've done an update on the Optionals/Other section
					with some more nifty gunskins so head on over and enjoy the weather.
					Seeing as Suislide goes nuts over on the <A HREF="http://action.telefragged.com">Official AQ2 site</A>
					with his movie reviews I thought I'd toss one in here to keep you guys
					reading..<BR><BR>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to go check out <A HREF="http://www.corruptor.com">&quot;The Corruptor&quot;</A>
					starring our two close buddies Chow Yun-Fat and Mark Wahlberg, under the
					direction of James Foley - even though I really wanted to see Wing Commander,
					I couldn't get in so The Corruptor was my second choice (I was in an
					&quot;action&quot; mood anyhow).  It ends up being a dark tale with a few twists and great
					action scenes (the car chase was my favourite) - when the film opened with
					Mr. Fat going akimbo style and the bad guys holding MP5s (or something darned
					close) spraying the hell out of the place I was brought in to the land of
					AQ2..  Unfortunately it was brief..  The film was a tad slow at times for
					my likings, though I appreciated the darkness of the whole film and the
					shady characters in it - it just felt like your typical NY cop in chinatown
					movie (not that any others comes to mind)..  I know anyone that plays AQ2
					will appreciate the action scenes - in fact many times I found myself wishing
					that I could rip some sounds from the movie and drop them in the game - especially
					if you're in a decent theatre with surround sound.  Should you see it?  I don't
					know - it all depends on your taste.  I am a very very critical moviegoer and find
					very few films that really grab me, if someone forced me to rank this movie
					I'd give it a 3 out of 5 if it were being compared just to all the action
					flicks I've seen before, lower if I compared it to every film I have seen in
					whatever genre.  It was a nice try, the action (though there isn't tons of it)
					is very good but the rest kept me marginally interested and sometimes I glanced
					at my watch to see when it would all be over.<BR><BR>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyhow, enough rambling - head on over to the Optionals and start
					arming yourself with some great fresh new skins!

					Also, there's a new tutorial on modeling up in the developers section written for beginners.  And the Skins section has
