								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, things are starting to move around here again.  There are a bunch of new optionals, and a reorganized tutorial page with 1 new tutorial link.  You can now use a glock for your primary pistol.  The m16 is fixed.  AND MORE!!!!!!!!  Go over to the <a href="optionals/index.html" target="_blank">optionals</a> section and check it out.

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot going on here these days, so I realy should update more.  The Models page has a groovy new feature where you can see every official model, with every official skin on it, in 3d.  Rotate it, whatever.  Just <a href="http://guild.telefragged.com/models/mdlviewer.html">go 1ook,</a> and be patient.  The files are large.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in to <a href="http://guild.action-web.net/optionals/index.html" target="_top">optionals section</a>, there are new gunskins, configs, weapon models (a new knife with new attack animations), and crosshairs.  And there's more where those came from.  I have an action WinAmp skin that I'll be putting on the others page soon, and a soundpack from Susano that will also be up.  Hell, I just added a <a href="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/guild/demos/cool2.zip">demo too - Homosaurus' actcity2 wall climb</a>.  Yeah, I know its old, but hell, its a demo.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear stirrings about action half life, and would just like to let you all know that the guild will be servicing the same types of things that it does for aq2 for ahl.  We will be a multi purpose site.  I, for one, can't wait.

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a modelling contest over at the <a href="http://aq2.action-web.net" target="_top">Action main page (link fixed)</a>.  We want you industrious modelors to make us some new action models.  Prizes have yet to be determined, but the prizes for the T-Shirt contest were pretty cool, so these just might be too.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a new action "league" I wanna plug real quick - the <a href="http://action.vortexq.com" target="_top">Action Summer Camp</a> has begun sign-ups, and looks to be a blast.  Go sign up, and join in the shenanigans.
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unorthodox is still catching up, but the optionals section should be rolling big time really soon.  Also, Kissmet might be back helping the demos section get rolling again.

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a problem with the directory struscture that the ModelPack 2 extracted to when it first came out.  It was missing the players folder, so if you are having trouble getting things to work, look in your action folder, and move all the folders that are named after models into your players folder.  HOWEVER!!!!! I have fixed the zip and exe versions so that if you download(ed) them anytime after like 3:30 PM EST on June 2nd, they should work fine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a file from vendetta that remaps sydney's skin, has a number of skins, a new set of sounds, just all kinds aof stuff.  It's pretty damn cool, actually (and just over 3MB).  You can get it <a href="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/guild/guildpacks/sydney.zip">here</a>
								<FONT COLOR=#808080>
									I'm getting closer on that redesign.  And closer to 30 years old {shudder}

AQ marine is a action specific modification of the Paranoid Marine from Hitman Daz.  <font color=red>BUT WAIT</font>, THAT'S NOT ALL!!!!!If you cat now, you will also get, included FREE, 68 SKINS for all kinds of models!!!!  There's messiah skins to make you look like a seafaring captain or Chow Yun Fat, and Action Male skins to make you look like Castor Troy.  And if you order with a credit card, we'll give you, absolutely free of charge, a vwep fix for the Sydney model!!!!!  Don't delay, get your <a href="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/guild/guildpacks/modelpack2.zip">zip version</a> or your <a href="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/guild/guildpacks/modelpack2.exe">exe version</a> today!!!!!

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well here's some more stuff to tease you with.  The guild pack 2 will be coming out soon.  Cloud is working on a model replacement for the Mk23 check it out <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~MeshHouse/modelpics/d_eagle_anim.GIF">here.  Its a Desert Eagle</a>  Also check out the future of the optionals section that I referred to in the last update.  <a href="http://guild.action-web.net/optionals/gunskins.html">Gunskins </a>and <a href="http://guild.action-web.net/optionals/gunreplace.html">replacement models</a>.  Gigolo is working on those and on a replacement page for the Sounds, so you can preview them before you download them.  A big thanks to Gigolo for that.

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The address of the actor's guild (and all action quake related sites) is about to change.  It will be http://guild.action-web.net.  Please start changing your links to reflect this.  The old one will still work for a little while.  Also, the optionals-other section will have a look more like the rest of the site.  It won't be like news updates all the time.  Keep an eye out for that.  (Thanks Gigolo)

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been leaving the guild updates totaly to the reliable

								forever ago and waited a month to add a skin to it.  Then I waited longer to
								upload it.  So here it is, a nice compliment to the other sniper rifle revolver
								we have already.  This one hs a nicer skin though, suz um... I did it.  (heh).
								<BR>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will, however, leave it to the staff to put this thing in

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello everyone its a new month and RogueWarrior=RC= is back
								and
								better than ever.  Things here at the guild are going along smoothly once again.
								Last month it seemed as though our 
								<a href="/masters/index.html">Guild Masters</a>
								were dropping like fly's.  So go check out the new guys that can't wait to get
								started.  Skins are still coming in like crazy and Warrlock_3 has promised an
								update
								coming soon. S'kebe is still busy fiddling around with the MDL viewer so that
								you can
								see skins on the models.  The Demos Section is back up and running thanks to
								Xineon.
								<BR>
								So everything is smooth sailing here at the Guild so keep coming back for more
								that
								you love about AQ2.  Oh and just so I don't disappoint you here is that
								<a href="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/guild/optionals/other/superhawk.zip">new sniper rifle</a>
								. I suggest you go check it out it is one of the coolest models
								I have seen yet.  If you downloaded the first version get this one many things
								have
								been fixed too.
