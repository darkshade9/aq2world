					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's some little things here and there around the site that
					are new. You probably notice that the optionals page is finally back up an running.
					Also the counter was on the fritz but is back up and ticking away. The developer's 
					section is growing, Grunt has kept up by adding a new image everyday to the Action
					Art page.  There's an informative tutorial on how to add an Action tab to GameSpy on 
					the Tutorials page. Also we got an interview with the one we all know as Suislide,
					and a great map maker BunnyX. Pretty soon we are going to have a much better way to
					vote for new skins and models. Also we have some more requests for skins and models.
					Among them a Navy Seal model, and skins to go with, including my mentor the real 
					life Rogue Warrior, Richard Marcinko. Check out the new pic of the day its actually
					a set of two that are sure to knock your socks off. Finally the downloads page is
			        filling out among other things that are going on behind the scenes too.

						a boring day) and you can leech leech leech.  All you readers have also probably
						noticed that I am getting a heck of a lot of help with this site, things are
						moving along nicely and we're getting internally reorganized to make sure that
						there will be something new every day for all of you fans to check out.  I myself
						have received plenty of skins, models, sounds, crosshairs etc and am redistributing
						them among the staff responsible for those sections.  Some of you have sent your
						own versions of .pak files gluing together your favourite tweaks to the AQ2 mod -
						they're all appreciated, and I check them all out, but we're going to save the &quot;big&quot;
						.pak releases for a bit and hit you all with some nicely organized updates you can
						just grab in one shot and start showing off all the new do-dads featured on the
						Actor's Guild.  We're still desperately looking for people making alternative gun
						models as well, so if anyone is working on those let us know!  :)

						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey everyone it's me again RogueWarrior and I am actually 
						making an update one day after the last one. I know your saying WOW! That 
						hasn't happened here at the guild in a little while. Luckily for you folks out
						there I don't like to disappoint you.<br><br>That last update really 
						made me look like a liar. The optionals	page is still not fixed. I know this 
						so you can stop sending me email saying	it's broken. Also Suislide and I were 
						a little busy last night trying to figure out a message board so he didn't get
						a chance to revamp the downloads page. I was going to put up another pic o' 
						the day but sadly I didn't get any good ones to put up. If you want to send in
						artwork send it to <A href="mailto:andrew15@iname.com">Grunt</A> so it will be posted on the action art page, the pic 
						of the day is for screenshots so keep sending them in. As for the new stuff 
						there is a News Archive now for last months news  and the guild masters page has
						its own navbar so its easier to get to the staff page. We had some a few 
						requests for skins lately. One of them is Leon from the movie The Professional
						and the others were the two guys from the movie Face Off. I forget the 
						characters names but its Nicholas Cage and John Travolta. So you skinners out
						there get busy and send your stuff in. Well that's it for now folks, and remember
						to keep coming back we'll always try to have something new for ya.

						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, as you can tell there isn't any big breaking updates
						 going on here at the guild.  This is the first update in a few days so bear 
						 with us. As you can see its really late and I am really tired so this is 
						 going to be short. The Action Art page has some new stuff thanks to Grunt.
						 The downloads page is currently getting revamped by Suislide. Unfortunately
						 the demos page is on hold because Kissmet's computer is on the fritz, but I 
						 guarantee you once it's up you will find some great learning resources there.
						 We are also updating the look a little bit here and there nothing major though.
						 Our pic of the day is turning into the pic of the week so submit your screenshots 
						 to me since Unorthodox is kinda busy with other stuff and I'll make sure we get 
						 some good ones posted. Other than that the site is still growing and filling out 
						 slowly but surely. The problem with the optionals page should be fixed by morning 
						 so you can get your gold akimbo pistols. We are sorry about the problem in the first
						 place should have never happened. Well that's all for now happy fragging.

						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, there's a bunch of new stuff to be found here.  We've added an <A href="developer/actionart.html">action art page</A>, with a bunch of really awesome pictures from Grunt.  This you absolutely must see.  It's in the developers section.  Then, there are skins to be voted on at the skins section, there are hints of things to come at the models section, heck, there are even downloads on the downloads page (finally).  Soon you won't have to dig through news updates to find the link to that file you heard about.  Also, go check out the interview with Gooseman over at the developers section.  It has 11 previously unreleased shots of the weapon and player models he's done/doing for half life!  And if that's not enough for you, the demos section is almost in full swing, and will be one of the most informative sections around.  Kissmet has some incredible surprises for you there.  Ever want to jump <b><i>TO</i></b> the middle building in urban?  And that's just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.

						to check out the new staff page, and find out who all the people are that are
						busting there rumps to bring you this wonderful site.  I also got my man Blake
						out there interviewing Gooseman (the original gun modeler for aq2). 
						Hopefully he's gonna write up a tutorial for us and same goes for the master
						modeler EvilBastard (The guy who brought us Sydney among other great models). 
						So keep sending in your articles, tutorials, optionals, skins, models, Whatever

						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just wanted to let everybody know that the ball is rolling!  We have three modeling tutorials over in the developers section, and have started on numerous interviews and tutorials from different people throughout the Quake community.  I also want to take this opportunity to ask that you, the dedicated action Quake 2 fan, submit articles about modeling, skinning, config files, or whatever you're really good at creating.  Thank you.

						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heck, you gotta have a gold gun to match those capped teeth though, eh?
						Well, changes galore it seems - Suislide says he's working on a downloads page to allow
						you all to grab the files from one central location; I've also made room for a demos
						section which should be debuting any time now.  Some minor tweaks to graphics (models
						header) and such.<BR><BR>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The config. file section is off to a great start, so you can find all
						the aliases and binds you may need in the Optionals section.  Some more gunskins coming your
						way as well in the Other subsection under Optionals.  Things are really picking up over here
						with all the kind souls that have volunteered to help us in our quest for giving you the latest
						and greatest information/files for AQ2.  Check out the Guild master's section for some info

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that a lot of folks like my gold akimbo pistols.  Some of you have even gotten motivated to do your own weapon skins after seeing them.  All I can say is GREAT!  I love this stuff.  I don't understand the urge everyone seems to have now to make all the weapons gold though.  If you have seen Face/Off then you will probably recognize the gold akimbo pistols and why I made them.  But hey, gold weapons are cool with me even if I don't understand them.  Now i only someone could make some alternate models.  Now that would be cool.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The positions for help here have all been filled.  Got a lot of good offers of help and after some interviewing and some damn hard consideration I picked the people I think best fit together as well as into their positions.  So I will be getting them up to speed in the next couple days and soon you should see a major increase in the speed things get done on the site as well as new things appearing both with and without notice.  Thanks goes out to all the people who offered help and didn't get the positions.  If you guys want to help still then what we could use the most is player model skins and that sort of thing.  I will also be organizing a group of people to help with a server help page that I think will make it a ton easier on our server ops and prospective server ops.  I will not be active in that page though, just going to get it going and see where it goes.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you haven't checked out action version 1.5 yet then you should be doing that and not reading this :)<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed a disturbing trend among the Action Quake fan sites.  People are mirroring the files that I and others put many hours into with no link or mention whatsoever letting people know they come from the Actor's Guild.  If people don't know where they come from then they won't come here.  If they don't come here they won't make or submit other things that you may very much want later on.  So do us and yourselves a favor and link back to this site every time you mirror one of the files from here.  It would be appreciated.<br>

							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, rather than get all mushy and sentimental on this

							to get used to, but what an exciting release!  You don't need to download
							anything to get it to work, so just keep your eyes peeled for those 1.5

							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've also gotten familiar with my &quot;helpers&quot; that will

							be unveiling the config. file section either tonight or tomorrow which should

							I still have a ton of skins from all of you that I haven't even touched yet - there's
							a reason for that - first off there's so many of them I can barely cope, secondly
							I believe what we will be doing is just posting the screenshots and then having
							all of you vote on which skins should be added to an official addon pak for Action
							Quake - sound good hunh?<BR><BR>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've also scored a new email address so from now on submissions to

							to all the wonderful people sending in all this cool stuff, and thanks for the letters
							of support and praise, you've all put a big smile on my face.  Now get on over to the
							optionals section and check out all the new goodies!
