								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not have the actor's guild model pack 1 yet then
								scroll down a few updates and get it.  The Action Quake version of the skinview
								mod is there too.
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made some updates to the page but I am not done yet so
								there are some pages that are incomplete.  I'll add a downloads page soon that
								will make getting the downloads easier.
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also added a tutorial in the optionals section to help
								people out with using things like gold akimbo pistols.  We haven't converted
								the files over to the new name standard so they aren't in pak files yet.  So
								you will have to try and figure it out based on the tutorial's info for now.
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am still waiting for someone to make a new weapon model to
								be an optional.  I would love to see someone make a .357 with a scope to
								replace the sniper rifle or a desert eagle to replace the mk23.  Uzi to replace
								the mp5, m16 or ak47 to replace the m4.  Well, those are justa  few ideas.  If
								you make them we will post them.  The optionals section is the most liberal
								thing we have.  Almost anything will be accepted, regardless of quality (unless
								it is pr0n or something else totally unrelated).  The skins and models sections
								are more selective because once we accept those they will go into packs that
								are required downloads whereas the optionals section is just that.  Optional
								things.

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The optionals section is really filling out with content,

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just wanted to let you guys know that there is a demos
								page coming here real soon so maybe that will boost the demo scene a little.  I
								honestly think that AQ is the perfect medium for many demos that are shot in
								regular quake2 and look silly.
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had actually already made a button for this site and just
								hadn't gotten around to uploading it yet.  I am kinda glad I didn't though
								because
								although mine looks better on a site that has a black background (like the main
								aq page)
								I think Unorthadox's is a better looking button over all.  (rambling again)
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyways, I mostly just wanted to let you know I was still
								paying
								attention and to mention the upcoming demo page.  Yet I would like to say that
								If you have any skills
								at all you can put them to use here.  Modelors can make alternate models so
								people could use a
								colt 1911 instead of the mk23 for example or they can make a player model.
								Skinners can
								make alternate skins or new player skins.  Sound guys can make new sounds.  You
								can
								make demos, new pictures, crosshairs, config files, console backgrounds,
								windows themes,
								tutorials, etc.  If it is AQ related and doesn't fit on the other sites then
								this is where it should go.
								Also, if you have any suggestions for the site or ideas on how it can be
								improved (new features,
								sections, whatever) then let one of us know and we will look into it.  Oh,
								please do not send me
								a bunch of files.  Unorthadox has a much faster connection speed and can handle
								the flow of
								files better.
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah, and I added a quote since I like having a quote on
								the page.  If you ever go to the Action Quake homepage you should probably be
								accustomed to it already.

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, thank-you's go out to all the creative people
								out there flooding me with content to put up on the site and giving the Actor's
								Guild their vote for support.  I'm trying to get through these emails as fast
								as I can!  There's an update in the Optionals section that I don't think anyone
								will want to miss, so drive your browser over there and check it out!
								<BR>
								<HR>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've also gotten some emails from a bunch of you asking for
								a button that they could use to link to the Actor's Guild so I put one together
								really fast, you can simply paste this code on to your web page:

								Ok, well this site is now officially open.  I am so tired I should pobably wait
								until tomorrow to post this but I want to get it done now.  Here are the files
								I talked about on the Action Quake homepage:
								</p>
								<p>
								The Action Quake version of the skinview mod is right here:
								<A HREF="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/action/guildstuff/AQskinview.exe">AQskinview.exe</A>
								<p>
								The very first Action Quake skin and model pack is right here:
								<A HREF="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/action/guildstuff/modelpak1.exe">modelpak1.exe</A>
								<p>
								If you didn't notice I only uploaded the exe versions for now.  The zip
								versions will come later probably.  If you really need them then let me know
								and I will upload them sooner.
								</p>
								<p>
								This site NEEDS your guys' contributions to survive.  Please send anything you
								can to Unorthodox.  His email is in the last update, I am too tired to copy it.
								Just about everything not covered by the other Action Quake sites will end up
								right here on the Actor's Guild.  Just please don't send maps since there is a
								map depot.
								</p>
								<p>
								This site will be Action Quake oriented but it is not ONLY for Action Quake.
								It will also server as a reservoir of knowledge for people who want to 'know'.
								Lot's of interviews, tutorials, etc. will be here before long.  The more that
								this site is successful then the more content we will be able to drag in.
								Things have just been hectic lately.  The site is still being formed really and
								this is just the beggining of it.
								</p>
								<p>
								Big thank you to everyone who contributed to what went into these 2 downloads.
								I think they are appropriate for kicking off this new site.
								</p>
