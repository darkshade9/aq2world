        tonite, or tomorrow morning. I have put 11 new skins onto
        the vote on skins page in the last couple of days, so
        enjoy. I have posted a skin for the McClane model. If you

        &nbsp;&nbsp; Hi folks. Like you can see there's major
        changes on this page. First there's a new section (skins
        suggestions) where you can post skin idea to help a
        little bit our skinners and if your a skinner this page
        will be full of good ideas for you. Second we have a
        brand new vote script here at the guild and it's very
        simple to use. Just select your favorite skin and press
        the little vote button.Third , I put 3 new skins in the
        beta skin section. There's 2 skin from Claymore and one
        from Clawz the optionals webmaster here at the guild. So
        that's all for now! Cya.</font></td>
