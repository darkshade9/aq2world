        &nbsp;&nbsp;I have posted a bunch of skins recently, so
        download them and check them out. The Darth Maul skin
        that was posted on the 15th, is the best Darth Maul skin
        I have received. Let's see some skins for the AQMarine
        and ActionRally models.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;I think I am finally caught up with
        everything. There are some new skin suggestions for you
        ambitious skinners, out there. I have also posted 10 new
        beta skins. So, go check them out.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;As you know by now, a new modelpack has been
        released with 68 of the skins that you guys have
        submitted. If you have submitted a skin, and it was
        posted on the beta_skins pages, but wasn't in the new
        modelpack, i am sorry. We received many skins, and could
        only put so many in the modelpack, and keep it to a
        resonable size. Don't be discouraged, and keep on
        submitting more skins. If you didn't notice, there are
        now beta pages for the AQMarine, OddJob and Female
        models, so lets see some skins for them. Keep on
        skinning!<br>
