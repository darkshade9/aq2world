Every link should be correct, but if you find one that isn't, or a file is missing, or anything like that, just let me know. The skins have been slowly flowing in. Hopefully we will have a few more models for you skinners to work with, soon. Skin suggestions have almost died off. I hardly receive any, and then they are usually repeats of previous one. The biggest request is skins from The Matrix. There are already several posted, so if you can't find them on the new suggestions page, goto the Messiah, Sydney, ActionRally sections. And if you have created new Matrix skins, send them in!<br>

People seem to be having trouble finding the new skins, when they are posted to their respective pages. So, the new submissions will posted on their own page (the 1st page you will come to in the Vote On Skins section) for one week and then be transfered to their own pages. Also, there has been a lot of requests for skins from The Matrix. There are now 2 new Matrix skins posted: Neo (for Shotgun Messiah) and Trinity (for ActionRally). enjoy.<br>
