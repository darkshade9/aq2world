        <font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you've
        downloaded some skins - now what? It's actually not as
        difficult as you might imagine. First you have to know
        which model the skin you are working with was designed
        for, you will find that in the Skin Catalog on this site
        each skin says which model it was made for - since you
        can take the skin metaphor a step further and imagine
        that these 2D images will be wrapped around a 3D model
        you should see why this is important.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you know what model the skin is
        for, you need to put the two files in the proper
        directory. You fill find all your Action Quake model
        directories in your Quake2\action\players folder. All you
        have to do is drop the two skin files in to the
        appropriate subdirectory. What are the two files? One is
        the skin which will be literally stretched over your
        Quake model, the other one which will be something like
        filename_i.pcx is the picture that is displayed when you
        look at the scores during play time.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these instructions in mind you
        should be well on your way to looking your finest in
        Action Quake!<br>
