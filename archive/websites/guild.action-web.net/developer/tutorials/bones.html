								Setting Up a Skeleton in Bones Pro
							</FONT>
						</H3>
						
						If you thought doing linked xforms was fun then you will love BonesPRo for Max.
						It makes skeletal animation nearly effortless.  The best part is that we can
						take our skeleton from the first tutorial and plop it right into bonespro.  All
						we need for this tutorial is the original skeleton we made (with no dummies
						attatched and no mesh verts linked to it) and a mesh to attach to it.

					First load up your skeleton and your mesh and make sure that the skeleton has
					been properly fitted within the mesh.  Go to the Create SpaceWarp tab and use
					the scroll bar to select Digimation Warps and click on the Bones Pro button.
					Pick a viewport and click somewhere nearby your mesh like above and to the
					right or something.  You will see the object appear for the Bones Pro space
					warp and the Bones Pro Space Warp rollout will appear on the right side of the
					screen. Click on the Assign button in the Bones section of the rollout and
					select every bone in your skeleton from the popup selection list.  At this
					point you want to bind your mesh to the space warp as well.  Select the mesh,
					click on the Bind To Space Warp button in the top toolbar and click/drag from
					the mesh to the spacewarp and release.  Next select your space warp and go to
					the modify panel to get back into the bonespro rollout.   From the Bound Node
					section click on the "None" button and select your mesh from the list.  The
					mesh name should show up in the button now, indicating it is the current bound
					node for this space warp.  This basically sets up your mesh with the spacewarp
					and skeleton.  It is now ready to animate - sort of.  Try going into animation
					mode in max, enable IK and move your skeleton around abit.  You will see it
					deforming the mesh but it may not seem very elegant at this point.  Most likely
					you will want to edit the influence of particular bones over the mesh.  Note:
					you can only deform your mesh in bones pro when animation is turned on.

							The Influence Editor
						</FONT>
					</H3>
					<IMG SRC="images/bpie.gif" WIDTH="358" HEIGHT="400" ALIGN="right" ALT="">
					The Influence Editor is the key to controlling how your skeleton affects your
					mesh when you animate it.  Each bone in Bones Pro affects all verts to some
					degree when you first apply the space warp.  By regulating the amount of
					influence each bone exerts you can localize this result to gain more accurate
					control of your mesh.  If you move the mouse over a bone you will see its
					strength and falloff settings appear on the status bar at the bottom of the IE
					window.  Also if you enable the Draw Mesh tool and then click on the Visualize
					Bone Influence tool you can see the effects of a bone's Strength and Falloff
					settings on the mesh itself by selecting a bone.  The blue areas of the mesh
					represent the parts that are not influenced by the selected bone.  The red
					areas indicate that the bone has absolute control over the mesh at that point
					(usually the area surrounding the middle of the bone.  The green areas
					encompass the falloff influence of the bone, where its influence over the mesh
					decreases (usually the ends of the bone).

							View Port Controls
						</FONT>
					</H3>
					
					<IMG SRC="images/viewport.gif" WIDTH="118" HEIGHT="25" ALT="">
					<BR>
					
					These tools function exactly the same as the ones for max, enabling you to
					control your view within the Influence editor.
					<BR>
					<P>
					
					
					
					<H3>
						<FONT COLOR=#454545>
							Bone Selection Controls
						</FONT>
					</H3>
					
					<IMG SRC="images/bones.gif" WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="27" ALT="">
					<BR>
					
					These tools are for selection of bones within the editor.

						<FONT COLOR=#454545>
							Influence Controls
						</FONT>
					</H3>
					
					<IMG SRC="images/influenc.gif" WIDTH="73" HEIGHT="25" ALT="">
					<BR>
					
					These tools allow you to adjust the Strength and Falloff settings of a bone
					when you select it as well as visualize their effects on the mesh.
					<BR>
					<P>
					
					
					
					<H3>
						<FONT COLOR=#454545>
							Vertex Selection Controls
						</FONT>
					</H3>
					<IMG SRC="images/vertex.gif" WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="24" ALT="">
					<BR>
					
					These allow you to select/deselect verts by area (drawing a window) or by their
					current relationship to selected bones.
					<BR>
					<P>
					
					
					
					<H3>
						<FONT COLOR=#454545>
							Include/Exclude Controls
						</FONT>
					</H3>
					
					<IMG SRC="images/inc-excl.gif" WIDTH="118" HEIGHT="25" ALT="">
					<BR>
					
					These tools work in conjunction with the vertex and bone selection tools by
					allowing you to include or exclude verts in a bone's influence range.  You must
					have a bone and some verts selected in the viewport in order to use these
					functions.
					<BR>
					<P>
					
					
					
					<H3>
						<FONT COLOR=#454545>
							Visualization Controls
						</FONT>
					</H3>
					<IMG SRC="images/visualiz.gif" WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="26" ALT="">
					<BR>
					
					
					These three tools enable you to toggle the display of bones, mesh, and verts in
					the editor window.
					<BR>
					<P>
					
					
					
					I wont go into detailed explanations of what each tool does in the Influence
					editor because it is so very simple to figure out.  What you want to do in the
					editor is make sure that each bone in your skeleton is only affecting the areas
					of the mesh that surround it, and fine tune this control.  So if you are moving
					the left foot of the skeleton in an animation and noticing that verts from the
					right foot are moving too, then you obviously have to exclude these verts from
					the left foot's influence.  If you find the shin bone is affecting verts in the
					thigh too much then try reducing its falloff settings.  Using bones pro is an
					exercise in trial and error, but don't worry, its pretty damn hard to Farg
					things up with this plugin.  Have fun with it.
