									Using Linked X-forms in Skeletal Animations
								</FONT>
							</H3>
							
							This tutorial assumes you followed the previous text on building a skeleton and
							setting it up for animation.  You will need a humanoid mesh and a skeleton to
							follow along in this one.  Assuming your skeleton is properly aligned within
							your mesh we can begin to link it up.  All we need to use here are two
							modifiers in max - Edit Mesh and Linked X-form.
							<BR>
							<P>
							
							<IMG SRC="http://guild.telefragged.com/developer/images/dumbones.gif" WIDTH="274" HEIGHT="326" ALIGN="right" ALT="Bones and Dummies">
							Before we link up the mesh to the skeleton we have to create some dummy objects
							to link to each bone.  I've found that trying to link a mesh to bones that have
							had their pivots moved tends to screw up my linked x-forms, so as a solution I
							create a dummy object for each bone, name it after the bone I link it to, and
							link my verts to the dummies instead.  Also using dummies allows you to do neet
							stuff like scale transforms to get those bulging biceps or
							expanding/contracting thorax effect (for models that like to breathe) without
							screwing with your skeleton.  Try not to make the dummies too big - they really
							only need to be big enough to see.  Position the dummy so that its center
							corresponds roughly with the center of the bone it will be linked to (not the
							bone's pivot).  Once you have a dummy linked and named after each bone you can
							link the mesh.

							<IMG SRC="http://guild.telefragged.com/developer/images/Lx-form.gif" WIDTH="316" HEIGHT="346" ALIGN="right" ALT="Vert Selection">
							To begin you must have an Editable mesh or at least apply an Edit Mesh modifier
							so that it is the last modifier in the stack.  Starting at the feet we go into
							vertex edit mode and select all the verts surrounding the left foot bone -
							basically whatever verts that define the foot.
							With the foot verts selected you then apply a Linked X-form modifier, click the
							Pick Control Object button then open the Object Selection List from the top
							toolbar, select the left foot dummy and click the Pick button at bottom. Your
							foot verts should now be linked to the left foot dummy, which is in turn linked
							to your left foot bone.  If you do a test rotation on the bone you should see
							the meshes' foot move accordingly.  This is where you determine if you've
							linked too many verts or not enough to the bone, and if any of them need to be
							adjusted.  If this is the case you don't need to delete the xform from the mesh
							stack, just go back to the edit mesh modifier (in the stack) where the verts
							were selected and make whatever modifications you need.  You can move them
							around, add or remove some from the selection - whatever, as long as you have
							the ones you want linked selected when you go back to the top of the stack.
							You can try your test rotations on the bone again to see the effects of your
							vert adjustments if you made any.
							<BR>
							<P>
							
							When you are satisfied with the results, apply an edit mesh modifier again and
							repeat the procedure for the right foot (Linked X-forms must always be preceded
							by an Edit Mesh modifier). It is always best to work with bone pairs when doing
							linked xforms because any modifications you made with the first xform will be
							fresh in your mind for the second.  Going fishing thru the stack after you've
							done 23 linked xforms and edit mesh modifiers can be a major ass pain if you've
							forgotten something, so try to resolve your xform issues in pairs and be done
							with it.
							<BR>
							<P>
							
							When you finish with one bone pair move up the heirarchy and repeat the Edit
							Mesh/Linked X-form procedure for the next bone pair or single bone in the case
							of the spine and pelvis, always testing as you go.  When you are finished with
							the vert links you should run your skeleton through a thorough series of tests
							before animating. Check the mesh from different perspectives and pose it as
							much and as varied as possible.  The more care you take in testing it the less
							hassle you have to deal with later on.
							<BR>
							<P>
							
							One more trick you can do with dummies (if you have the patience for LX-forms)
							is create a few extra to add at all your joint locations on the skeleton, and
							link a few joint verts to them.  This helps distribute the vertex load between
							joining bones and allows for finer manipulation of verts at the joints.  I've
							found that without the extra joint dummies you can get really gross distortion
							of verts at the joints (especially the shoulders).  Note that adding joint
							dummies requires you to break some links by relinking children as children of
							the joint and then linking the joint to a parent.  This should be done before
							the mesh is linked to the skeleton.  Example:  The forearm would be relinked to
							the new elbow joint and the elbow joint would then be linked to the arm.  All
							you do is select and link to the new parent, since a child can only have one
							immediate parent bone, the old parent will be forgotten, regardless of any
							previous biological or emotional relationship.  You also shouldn't have to
							worry about setting IK rotational limits to the joint dummies because you will
							really only be adjusting them minutely using FK rotations.
							<BR>
							<P>
							
							The trick with Linked X-forms is to visualize your verts and their relationship
							to the bones they will be linked to before you link them.  Try to picture the
							effect that a bone will have on its surrounding verts as you move it.
