							There are two options for doing skeletal animation without a plugin.  The first
							is to use Max Bones which will basically allow you to whip up a quick skeleton
							with a few clicks and drags, resulting in a series of linked bones.  The second
							option is to create each bone by hand using primitives, and linking them all
							together with the link tool.  For myself I prefer to use primitives (boxes
							specifically) since their rotational positions during an animation are more
							easily recognized.  Also, with Max Bones you have to be careful when doing
							transforms without the use of Inverse Kinematics because doing move transforms
							will scale the bones (this is a bad thing, unless your mesh is Inspector
							Gadget).  This tutorial will deal with skeletons made from primitives.
							Besides, its cooler to be able to make a skeleton from scratch and if you can
							do this then max bones are a snap.  You don't have to use this method but
							knowing it will benefit your life somehow.

									Creating the skeleton
								</H3>
							</FONT>
							The first thing you need for a skeleton is a mesh that will be attached.  You
							really should build the skeleton with the mesh in view so that you are aware of
							proportion and the relationship of each bone to the body.  This way you can fit
							each bone to the next right within the mesh as you build your skeleton.  For
							bone measurements I recommend using L=2 W=2 and H=whatever length is required
							for the bone to fit the mesh. Copy as many bones as you can get away with in
							your skeleton, ie.  right shin bone could be a copy of the left shin, top and
							middle spine bones could be copies of the base spine bone, etc.  This saves
							time and ensures that the right and left sides of your skeleton are in equal
							proportions.

									The Bones
								</H3>
							</FONT>
							
							Here is a list of the typical bones I used for our example skeleton:
							
							<UL>
								<IMG align=right alt="Mesh with Bones" height=340 src="images/meshbone.gif" width=325 >
								<LI>
								foot          x2
								<LI>
								heel          x2
								<LI>
								shin          x2
								<LI>
								thigh        x2
								<LI>
								pelvis
								<LI>
								lowspine
								<LI>
								midspine
								<LI>
								topspine
								<LI>
								neck
								<LI>
								shoulder  x2

								<LI>
								forearm    x2
								<LI>
								hand x2 total bones =21
								<
								
								/LI >
							</UL>
							
							You should be moving each bone into place within the mesh as you build it so
							that your skeleton gradually takes shape within the mesh. This makes it easier
							for copying duplicate bones from the right or left sides and results in fewer
							size adjustments in the end.  Once all your bones are in place you need to
							adjust their pivot locations so that they will bend appropriately when linked.
							With this layout you can get pretty decent animations for a low poly humanoid.
							Add extra bones for more realism if you think you need it, such as a skull bone
							for the head.
							<BR>

									Pivot Point Adjustment
								</FONT>
							</H3>
							There are several ways in which you can arrange pivot locations in your
							skeleton.  The easiest way (the one I'm going to use here) is to assume that
							the pelvis is going to be the root object in your skeleton, meaning that all
							other bones will be children of the pelvis.  What this means is that all bones
							in the skeleton will move and rotate according to the location of the pelvis.
							If the pelvis moves, the whole skeleton moves.  If the pelvis remains
							stationary then other bones can be moved independently but still maintain their
							relationship to the pelvis.  Adjusting the pivot points of each bone is a
							matter of visualizing where each bone should bend within the heirarchy.  The
							hierarchy of our example skeleton is as follows:
							<BR>
							
							
							<IMG alt="heirarchy text" src="images/heirarch.gif" >
							<BR>
							
							As you can see here, every bone in the body is a child of the pelvis, since
							they are all linked indirectly to the pelvis through a heirarchical
							relationship.  So for the hands to bend at the wrist we want the pivot to be
							closer to the forearm.  For the forearm the bend is at the elbow so the pivot
							should go closer to the arm.  For the arm the bend is at the shoulder so the
							pivot should go towards the shoulder.  The shoulders are linked to the topspine
							bone so pivots should be moved closer to the topspine.  The lowspine bone bends
							from the pelvis so the pivot should be moved closer to the pelvis.  Basically
							the object here is that each bone in the heirarchy should have its pivot
							adjusted closer to its parent bone.
							<BR>
							
							
							Go to the Heirarchy panel and click on the pivot button. We only want to adjust
							the location of the pivots of our bones so click on the Affect Pivot Only
							button and begin selecting each bone and moving its pivot.  Use the move
							transform tool and axis restrictions to keep your pivot adjustments more
							precise.
							<BR>
							
							
							<FONT COLOR=#454545>
								<H3>
									Linking the Bones
								</H3>
							</FONT>
							
							Once all the pivots have been adjusted we are ready to link the bones.  Keep in
							mind that the pelvis is the root or parent of the heirarchy we will create.
							Start with the bones furthest from the pelvis  and link them to a parent until
							you have all bones linked heirarchically to the pelvis.  Use the heirarchy
							diagram above for reference if you need it, tho linking is basically common
							sense here.  To begin linking select a bone such as the foot then click the
							Select and Link button from the toolbar at the top of your screen.  With the
							Link tool active you then click on the selected bone (foot in this case) and
							drag to its intended parent (the heel, or shin if you aren't using a heel bone)
							until the cursor turns green.  Release the mouse button at this point and the
							parent bone will flash white indicating it has been selected as a parent in the
							link.  This process should be repeated up the heirarchy until the entire leg
							has been linked with the pelvis as the parent or final link.  Repeat for the
							other leg.  Next select the neck or skull bone (whichever is farthest from the
							pelvis) and repeat the process again until the pelvis is the parent of the
							bones in the spine.  With the arms you start linking at the hands and continue
							up to the shoulders, which are then linked to the topspine bone.  Once the
							shoulders are linked to the spine you needn't continue to link down to the
							pelvis because the spine links have already been done.  This should result in a
							finished skeleton.  Try turning on the Inverse Kinematics tool and manipulating
							the skeleton with the move transform tool to make sure all the links are
							correct.  When using inverse kinematics its best to use the extremity bones
							such as the hands, feet or head to move.
							<BR>
							
							
							<H3>
								<FONT COLOR=#454545>
									Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics
								</FONT>
							</H3>
							The skeleton is ready to animate at this point.  There are two ways to go about
							this in Max.  We can use forward kinematics which basically involves using the
							rotation transform tool, selecting a single bone and rotating it about its
							pivot on a single axis.  Axis restriction is a big help here and can provide
							very precise rotations.  We can also use inverse kinematics which enables you
							to achieve quicker results by selecting a child bone like a hand or foot and
							using the move transform tool to move it, while the parent bones up the
							heirarchy transform with it.  Whichever method you feel most comfortable with
							to get the results you need.  Using inverse kinematics to create the broader
							movements of limbs first then going back and using forward kinematics to tweak
							and refine the movements is an effective way to animate a skeleton.  However,
							in order to use IK effectively you will first have to set some joint
							limitations to prevent your skeleton from going haywire when you try to animate
							it.
							<BR>
							
							
							<H3>
								<FONT COLOR=#454545>
									Setting Joint Limitations
								</FONT>
							</H3>
							You really only need to limit the joints in a skeleton if you plan on using IK
							since FK is based on rotations of individual bones around their respective
							pivots.  IK however uses the complete child/parent relationship in a heirarchy
							to achieve skeletal transforms.  If you limit the joint rotations in an IK
							chain before animating you will save yourself a headache later.  It takes a
							little more time but is well worth it.
							<BR>
							<P>
							
							
							
							Achieving realistic human skeletal joint limits is simply a matter of
							observation and learned behaviour.  You already know the limits of the bones in
							your body so all you have to do is transfer this knowledge to your Max
							skeleton.
							<BR>
							
							Select a bone, go to the Heirarchy tab and select the IK button at the top of
							the rollout then scroll down to the Rotational Joints section.  There are three
							sections here - one for each axis of rotation.  By default each axis is active
							meaning the bone has unlimited rotational freedom.  This is bad for a human
							skeleton.  Actually it would be pretty cool but for a realistic human skeleton
							in max it is bad.
							<BR>
							<P>
							
							
							
							We want to limit the rotations of each axis so we start by checking the Limited
							box for each axis. All we really need to do after this is use the From/To
							spinners to set the limits of rotation from one angle thru to the next to
							create a set of degrees that the bone will be able to rotate thru around a
							single axis. Ignore the other options for now since they aren't really
							necessary for our skeleton.  As you hold the mouse down on a spinner you can
							see in the active viewport that the selected bone rotates about its pivot
							around the axis you are currently limiting.  When you let go of the spinner the
							bone snaps back into place but will be limited to rotation by the number of
							degrees showing in the spinner's display box. Do the same with the To spinner
							only going in the opposite direction.  The best way to figure out how far you
							should go with the spinners is to compare the movement of the bone you are
							limiting with that of its real life counter part on your body.  This is very
							interactive and fun too!  If you want to cheat you can probably obtain the real
							joint limitations for a skeleton from any good anatomy text or a book on
							character animation but I doubt you'd be reading this if you had those.
							<BR>
							<P>
							
							
							Once you've set your joint limitations your skeleton is ready to animate using
							Fk or Ik.  Try using IK and you will see that already the skeleton is
							transforming much more realistically. There is one more thing we can do in the
							IK section to make using Ik a little easier and that is to adjust the object
							parameters at the top of the rollout.  Select a shoulder bone and check the
							Terminator box.  Do this for both shoulders then go back and try moving the
							hands with IK.  You will see that the spine no longer transforms when you pull
							on the hands.  This is because we have halted the IK chain for the arms at the
							shoulders.  The shoulders are still linked to the spine and will transform if
							the spine is moved.  What we are basically doing here is turning the shoulders
							into a pseudo root or parent object for the arm heirarchy - essentially a sub
							IK chain that still depends on its parent objects.  The pelvis is a natural
							terminator already since it is the parent of all objects, that is why the spine
							doesn't transform when you move the legs.
							<BR>
							
							
							<H3>

									Broken Heirarchies
								</FONT>
							</H3>
							There is one other method I will outline here that is a little more advanced
							and that is the use of a reverse or broken IK heirarchy for the legs.  This is
							the method Paul Steed used in creating the Q2 player model.  The skeleton is
							basically created the same way as above, except for the linking.  Instead of
							linking the legs to the pelvis you will reverse the linkage and use each foot
							as a root object as well, with the shins as children of the feet and thighs as
							children of the shins.  You will also have to move the bone pivots to the
							bottom of the bones since the parent/child relationship is reversed.  You can
							do this with the arms as well but I don't recommend it as it often isn't
							necessary.  The main advantage of a broken heirarchy in the legs comes in
							animation.  Having the legs separate from the body can result in smoother more
							stable movements, however you have to deal with separate skeletons within your
							mesh then which means that if you move the feet you then have to move the
							thighs back into position with the pelvis to keep your mesh from deforming
							improperly.  If you are new to skeletal animation I recommend avoiding this
							method until you are more comfortable with the hip centric method I outlined
							previously.
