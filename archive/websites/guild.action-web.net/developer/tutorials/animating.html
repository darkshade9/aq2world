This is often the most lengthy and time consuming part of the process. Fortunately the chicken model was deliberately made to be easy to animate. All parts of the chicken were easily selectable and as no complex motion (ie. walking) was nessesary the chicken only took an hour or two to finish.
<P>
If you are new to this animation section of the process my first bit of advice would be to look at another player model. First make a note of what each frame is called (you could do this be simply having two copies of MDL open) and secondly take note of what the model does in each animation.
<P>
To begin you must first load up your model into MDL. Now click on the V tab in the top left of the screen. You should now have the model loaded and in the bottom left of the screen a zero and frame 1 showing.
<P>
Now, to rename the frame either bring down the edit menu and click on change frame name or press Ctrl+R. Now change the frame name to Stand1.
<P>
You now have two options either insert all the frames and enter all the frame names and leave the animation until later. Or animate as you add each new frame. To add a new frame either bring down the edit menu and click on add new frame or press Ctrl+I. Once you have all the frames named (assuming you did this first) double check to make sure you haven't missed out any frames.
<P>
Now you can begin animating the model. If you have got this far you should be competant enough to do this. Complex models will be very difficult to animate using the method i used for the chicken so another method should be found (NB\ Bones are dissabled in my version of MDL), one possibiltity is to do you animation in a proper 3D modelling and animation program. Anyway the way i animated the chicken was to simply select vertexs/faces and move/rotate them. There was nothing more complex than this.
<P>
One useful tip however is to make use of the copy selected function then paste over the next frame. Also note the blend factor control. This means using only two frames, start possition and end possition for a motion you can quickly fill in the frames in-between.
