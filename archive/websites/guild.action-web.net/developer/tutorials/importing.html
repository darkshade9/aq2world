<P>
Once you have saved your model as a .lwo file enter MDL (aka Quake 2 Model Editor (in this tutorials case v0.90)). Now click on file, move down to import and then click on import append verts... - Now locate your model.
<P>
You should now be able to see your model as a wireframe or mesh, however it will probably be to small/large, incorrectly orientated or floating above the ground.  In order to rectify this click on file then choose reference model - now locate the directory Quake2\baseq2\players\male and select the male model (probably called tris.md2).  You should now be able to see the standard quake player model in the 3D preview window.
<P>
Select your model (either all the vertexs (points) or faces (polygons)) and rotate, scale and move your model until it reaches the desired scale. This is a critical point - it is essential that you get this right. In the chickens case this is where i made my first mistake - <B>THE CHICKENS FEET ARE BELOW GROUND LEVEL!!!</B> Once your model is facing the correct way, on the correct ground level etc (dont place him on the origin or grid - this isn't the ground plane!) you are ready to begin worrying about textures.
<P>
NB\ To clear the reference model click on file, then clear reference model.
