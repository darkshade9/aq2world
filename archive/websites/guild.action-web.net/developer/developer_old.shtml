I now have only 10 images to the main page, then you have to click next ten. The main page had like 20 images, and it was taking to long to load. I added two new images, one is a quicky image by myself, nothing special, and another from DarkEclipse, he is the same guy as Deathknight, but wants to be called DarkEclipse! A great image he sent, very funny, a must see!
