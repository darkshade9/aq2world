<br><b>Hammer:       How'd you find out about Action Quake?</b>
<br>BunnyX:  Ack, it was ages ago. No wait, it was only last September, my how time 
flies. Anyway I'd just gotten a copy of Quake 2 from my brother and I 
was really unimpressed with it's multiplayer aspect. Around the same 
time the name AQ kept popping up alot on the Ultima Online message 
boards I used to frequent (however I no longer play UO) so I decided to 
check it out and it turned out to be one of the better ways I've ever 
waste my time with. ;)

<br>
<br><b>Hammer:       (For our less observant readers) which action maps have you made?</b>
<br>BunnyX:  The only map I've made that's been released so far is
<a href="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/action/maps/bxtrain2.zip">Terror on the Tracks (bxtrain2)</a>. There is no bxtrain1 available publically, since that 
was a rather limited release for testing, the results of which were put 
into the second version. <a href=" http://dload.mapdepot.net/maps/bxw7.zip">Warehouse 7 (bxw7) </a>is in testing at the Map 
Depot as we speak. It's deliberately modelled on hostage 2, which I 
think is a fantastic AQ map, but severely underrated and sees very 
little rotation on servers these days, which is a real shame.  {Ed. Note - map released on 2/23/99}

<br><b>Hammer:       How long have you been making maps?</b>
<br>BunnyX:  On and off for about two years now. My work for AQ would be the first 
ever maps that have been released publically. Previous to that I made 
about a half dozen or so Quake I maps for my lan group, none of which 
have been released to my knowledge.
<br>
<br><b>Hammer:       What do you use to make your maps?</b>
<br>BunnyX:  Tracks I whipped up using Worldcraft, since it's the same editor that I 
used in my Quake I days. I've learnt to appreciate what BSP can do 
though, it's a really fantastic, if user unfriendly, piece of software.
<br>
<br><b>Hammer:       What's the average time necessary for creating a map?</b>
<br>BunnyX:  Since I like small tight maps I'll usually spend less than a week from 
the rough sketches to the finished product. The train was really fast 
since the segments were virtually identical and all that needed to be 
done was to fill the carriages with individual content. I lack a lot of 
patience, so if a project is taking too long I'll shove it aside and 
pick it up much later when I'm not so sick of it. {=)
<br>
<br><b>Hammer:       What's your favorite map overall?  for action?</b>
<br>BunnyX:  Oooh, tough call. It's a tie between Lock 'n Load and Hostage2. They 
play so well, and the AQ'er that knows what he's doing can survive 
indefinitely on these levels. Well, that was in the days when deathmatch 
was the way to play, and everyone did it with style. Hammer:sighHammer:
<br>
<br><b>Hammer:       Do you have anything groovy in the pipeline (new maps coming?)</b>
<br>BunnyX:  Hmm, I have a half finished sewer system sitting on my HD, and sketches 
for a latin american village, a jungle island hideout/laboratory, a 
plane and a three ring circus. No telling when, or even if they'll all 
get finished. ;)
<br>
<br><b>Hammer:       Do you still play action quake?  What mods do you play?</b>
<br>BunnyX:  Only on occasion now, since I'm spending less time on the computer these 
days thanks to art school starting up and things.
<br>
<br><b>Hammer:       What do you do when you're not making maps or playing quake?</b>
<br>BunnyX:  Drawing or painting usually, while ponder getting more exercise. 
<br>
<br>Hammer:  Thanks a lot for your time!!!!!
