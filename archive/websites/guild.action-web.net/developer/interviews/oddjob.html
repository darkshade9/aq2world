          <p> <font SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><b>The Interview</b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Only just recently I had the pleasure of meeting Oddjob1138, 
            the creator of the popular 'oddjob' player model. This is the first 
            interview I'd ever done so thanks for not running out on me or using 
            that razor brimmed hat :) But enough of the Gaffing, on with the thing 
            you came to read...<br>
            </font></p>
          <p>[Boggy B]: How long have you been Modeling?</p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">[Oddjob]:Since last March. Before that 
            I knew nothing of the subject.</font></p>
          <p>[BB]: So did you do any Quake 1 models then?</p>
          <p>[OJ]: Nope. I don't even own Quake 1.</p>
          <p>[BB]: {in shock}, Surely not!<br>
            [BB]: Was Oddjob your first model in the Q2 Scene?</p>
          <p>[OJ]: No. Actually I was playing Superheros 2 mod for Q2 and I got 
            the idea to make a Green Goblin model. So I took the male model and 
            added his glider to it. That was back in March. Oddjob was my third 
            attempt.</p>
          <p>[BB]:What was the 2nd?</p>
          <p>[OJ]:Dr. Doom. I did that as a trade for some software, then started 
            Oddjob.</p>
          <p>[BB]: Is Quake 2 the only game you've modelled for?</p>
          <p>[OJ]: No I have been working on AHL for a while now.</p>
          <p>[BB]:What software do you use for modelling, 3D studio Max...?</p>
          <p>[OJ]:3dsmax for Dr Doom, Velvet Jackson, Oddjob and the Half Life 
            stuff of course. But I did M on Maya.</p>
          <p>[BB]:For HL are you just doing the player models, or are you branching 
            out into Weapons, items etc?</p>
          <p>[OJ]:No for now, just player models. And all the new animations that 
            Action Half Life requires.</p>
          <p>[BB]:Any chance of any Sneak Previews of the models?</p>
          <p>[OJ]: I'll have to ask Suislide, but probably. Suislide likes to 
            keep things hush hush. [Model Pictures at The Bottom!]</p>
          <p>[BB]:yeah I can understand that.. :) <oddjob><boggy_b> Was Oddjob 
            specifically for AQ <boggy_b> or was it just an all round model?</p>
          <p>[OJ]:He started as an AQ only model but I added regular vwep and 
            he was released about a month before he came out in the Aq2 model 
            pak</p>
          <p>[BB]:I was gonna ask you what has influenced you, but I'm guessing 
            007?</p>
          <p>[OJ]:Yup. I have been a fan since I was 10 years old. Of the books 
            more than the movies.</p>
          <p>[BB]:Ahh yes, Ian Flemming...</p>
          <p>[OJ]:I named my son after him. Ian that is.</p>
          <p>[BB]:Not James :)</p>
          <p>[OJ]:Nope. He is more of an Ian.</p>
          <p>[BB]:What is <i>your</i> favourite model out on AQ...?</p>
          <p>[OJ]:SAS, but it's becomming over used. I wish there was some way 
            to get AQ2 vwep for the McLaine model. That is a great model. Some 
            people don't like the run animation, but I think the author nailed 
            Willis' run. <oddjob> Oh, and M. </p>
          <p>[BB]:What would be your favourite Map for Aq?</p>
          <p>[OJ]:I really like the new Lighthouse map. But my favorite map would 
            probably have to be Urban.</p>
          <p>[BB]:Ahh, I haven't seen Lighthouse, I'd prolly go for Armyterr meself. 
          </p>
          <p>[OJ]:I like that one as well. Except for when I fall in the damn 
            pit.</p>
        </div>
        <font SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> 
        <P><font color="#808080">...</font>After that point, I had to go to dinner 
          which I was decidedly unhappy about, perhaps it's one of the things 
          I'll have to get used to as I try to bridge the gap known only as the 
          Atlantic. I had a great time talking to Oddjob and I think we both survived 
          my first interview intact :)<br>
          Once again Thanks Oddjob, we await Action Half-Life in more awe after 
          looking at the models you have been working on....<br>
