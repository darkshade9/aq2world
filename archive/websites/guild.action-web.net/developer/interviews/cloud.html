<b>[Hammer]</b> So, how long have you been modeling?
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> hrm, 'bout 2 years now, nothing big, just here and there.
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> how long have you been an action fan?
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> all mah life? aq?
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> yeah
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> i dunno, quite some time.  But i'm not an old-schooler.
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> what modelling prog you use?
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> QME *shudder* and Q2Modeler.  It's a serious pain to finish stuff with that damn 20 frame limit and all
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> do you do your own skin mappings?
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> yah, I use NST for that
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> and who's your skinner?
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> well, i try to skin my stuff, but it never turns out too well, (see the original Rally skin ;)
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> :)
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> right now, Red13 is skinning the magnum
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> is there action quake vwep for rally?
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> yah
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> is it on the version the guild has already?
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> no, that was a pre-release for skinners.   Suislide said not to use it as a PPM, but i guess that didn't work, eh?  I keep hearing (on the message board) about ppl complaining it has no Viewwep and that the arms are red, etc.  I try to set 'em straight
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> I love people that complain about using stuff they're not supposed to use anyway :)
<img src="images/cloud-new.jpg" width=200 height=519 border="0"align="right">
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> haha - right on
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> DOH!!! I forgot the basics - name , age, occupation
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> yeah, i noticed that :)
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> Mark Potnick, OhioWhiteboy, in aq :)  I'm 16...a young'un - and therefore, I'm a student

<br><b>[Hammer]</b> do you have any shots of other models you've
done?
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> i did a cloud model (go figure), which turned out ok.  I did the skin too...
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> bah, i'm happy with it
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> so what kinds of movies do you like?
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> action, matrix was a blast - very nice.  The essentials, pulp fiction, etc.
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> ...just saw "go"...
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> any good?
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> 'twas ok
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> what is your favorite model other than yours?
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> i absolutely love perilith knight (not an action model) but it has a VERY nice Vwep.
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> how bout action?
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> i seem to like sydney...and any model by Evil B
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> EvilB is, well damn good
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> ha, no kidding
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> what skins do you like for aq?
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> well, that natasha skin for rally is nice.  I seem to like the classics, other than that: terrorist, grunt (heh) etc.<img src="../activate.gif" width=243 border="0" align=left>
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> how bout a favorite action map?
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> thats a tough onebut I'd have to say "classics" again, actcity2, blockwar.  I really like colt compound
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> old school, as it were
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> Haha,  as much as this kid can be, i suppose
<br><b>[Hammer]</b> I appreciate your time and thanks again!!!!!!
<br><b>[Cloud]</b> No problem.
