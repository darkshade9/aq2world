<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Several guides have been written by various players
on the technique of sniping. However, I think it has been assumed incorrectly
that all players have learned the basics of close combat melee. Close combat
melee refers to any fight involving two or more people in combat at once,
like circle strafing in the streets or ducking and weaving behind obstacles
on the rooftops or in hallways. Close combat melee is when you can see
the details on the enemies face.&nbsp; There are a couple of different
items you want to keep in mind when attempting to mix it up at close range
like this.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, the weapon that you use is <I>not</I>
the most important factor in deciding who will walk away from the fight.
The deciding factor is usually movement. The most efficient method of melee
movement will yield a clear shot for you, while limiting the opportunities
for your opponent.&nbsp; To evade fire, you can use the terrain around
you as hard cover, or even the other players&nbsp; whenever you can.&nbsp;
Until you are positive that nobody is going to spawn in behind you, never--and
I mean never--stand still for very long (more than three shots,) unless
you have some kind of death wish. Peeps standing motionless are the bread
and butter of the frag seeking public and will be spared no mercy. You
know who you are.

<P>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right about here is where I get complaints about
LPB's.&nbsp; You can help offset the advantage an LPB has when you learn
how you can compensate for it. To hit those nasty low pingers you will
need to aim in front of them.&nbsp; Yeah, McDizzo, but how far?&nbsp; Simple..
aim ahead by an amount equal to the distance the enemy can move in the
meantime.&nbsp; If your ping is only off by a hundred milliseconds or so
you probably won't notice much difference.&nbsp; But a target can move quite
a bit in 300 milliseconds.&nbsp; You just aim where the enemy will be when
your laggy bullets get there.&nbsp; If that's confusing, listen to your
gut and aim there.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regards to aim, the sweet shot is the head
of course, but don't forget that a couple of MK23 rounds in the chest will
fell an opponent as well. Pick your targets; if you know who you are going
to shoot it makes it a lot easier to actually hit him. This is the hard
part because there are a bunch of other folks gunning for you too.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Next on the list is your choice of weapon. <B><I><U>Important:</U></I></B>
depending on the weapon that you are using your movement and target may
change slightly. This happens because some weapons are not well suited
for melee combat. The best melee weapons are close range weapons. As I
said earlier, close range is any distance where you can see the details
of the players face. I suppose the best way to illustrate this is to do
a little run down of the weapons, so here goes (you can click the header for an example):

<P><U><a href="long.html">Extreme Long-Range Weapons</a></U>:
<LI>
SSG 3000 Sniper Rifle - The sniper rifle is a long range weapon. This
is a gun that is not to be used in close combat unless you are out of everything
else and have thrown away your knife. It is very inaccurate off the hip
(unzoomed) and you will end up dead more often than not if you try to use
this close quarters.</LI>


<P><U><a href="mid.html">Mid-Range Weapons</a></U>:
<LI>
Mp5 Submachine gun - This is a mid-range weapon because of the light
nature of the ammunition.&nbsp; Even in the chest it will take at least
three rounds to kill a target. This is a weapon that gets abused by many
trying to use it from an exceptional distance; the Mp5 is not a sniping
weapon. Also, if you are going to run and shoot with this weapon, you can
start looking for a different guy to kill; more often then not you will
be respawning soon. (Note: Kevlar will stop this weapon cold. Take care
to get at least one head shot in, or you will become the victim.)</LI>

<LI>
M4 Assault Rifle - Do not overlook the amazing stopping power that
this gun has. I enjoy mowing down a target as much as the next guy, but
it is not a sniper rifle, it is not a handgun, it is an assault rifle and
must be used as such. To use this weapon you need to be a little distance
away and just let loose with a volley. Its a good idea to use the &quot;weapon&quot; command&nbsp;
so that it shoots in the more accurate 3-round burst as opposed to just
emptying the entire clip into your target. This firearm uses a lot of ammo
very quickly so it is important to control it. Trying to use this gun in
a close combat situation will frustrate you, because while you are moving
it jumps all over the place and it rides up due to recoil. Definitely a
plant and shoot weapon, at least if you wish to use it effectively.</LI>

<LI>
M3 Super 90 Assault Shotgun - I place this weapon in the mid-range
category for one important reason. If you are going to be using the shotgun
in close combat, and are swinging the gun about trying to hit a target
you will not have as good a chance of actually hitting your target. Yes,
this will kill them instantly if taken point blank, but that isn't the
point of a shotgun, now is it? Pepper the quarry from a few paces out and
you will see much better results in the way of blood, and blinding the
opponent. The point is to stay alive and kill the enemy. Firing from a
slight distance is much better because it forces the other guy to make
the better shot, you can cover more area. You have the advantage with this
weapon.</LI>


<P><U><a href="short.html">Close Range Weapons</a></U>:
<LI>
Handcannon - I have very little to say about this gun. The reload is
slow, so pull the trigger point blank. Sure, it can be used to blind or
damage your opponent a great deal, but the charm of the gun is in the raw
power.&nbsp; Sneak up to your target with the slippers and POW!&nbsp; No
more opponent.</LI>

<LI>
Akimbo Pistols - This is a personal favorite. They can be used at any
range. You can just plant firmly in the chest or head and pull the trigger,
or stand on a building and try to snipe. A big mess later you will have
a frag. They are relatively easy to use both standing still and while running.
These are carnage machines.&nbsp; A really good way to go is to get a Bandolier
and gather ammo, or go into tank mode with the Kevlar.</LI>

<LI>
MK23 Pistol - I believe this to be the most effective weapon at any
range. Another big bonus of the MK23 is the fact that the accuracy is not
significantly impacted by movement. If you can learn to use this gun the
rest of the game becomes a lot easier.</LI>

<LI>
SOG-37 Knife - The knife is available to throw and for use as a slashing
weapon. Ordinarily used as a last resort, I am aware of a few players who
can do really great things with this blade right off the bat. You must
be point blank in their face and keep slashing. Always go for the chest
and head. If you can slash out a leg, or shoot them in the legs first,
it is easier to track them down and cut them from behind. To use the thrown
version effectively, all I can say is practice. The knife has a definite
curve (due to gravity) and accuracy can only come with practice. If you
do hit your target, the thrown knife does damage equivalent to the sniper
rifle. A good skill to have. You can carry 10 knives, 20 with a Bandolier.</LI>

<LI>
Boot to the head - I almost forgot that when all else fails, or even
just for fun, a swift kick can be a very effective weapon. You can jump
on top of their head and crouch there for repeat damage or kick peeps off
of high places for a satisfying crunch. If you are out of ammo, and you
don't like the knifes try to kick them. To execute a kick you must be right
next to them and jump, that's it.</LI>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That about covers the weapons and the uses and
ranges and such. You can pair up with different items depending on the
map you're fragging on. Use a silencer for dark areas, the laser sight
if you are unsure of your aim. The only item I really didn't cover was
the grenades. Use Frag Grenades in situations where there are large volumes
of combatants, or to reach a hard to shoot place. The middle of a big gun
battle is also a good bet. Look at where peeps are moving to figure out
where to throw, and use the &quot;weapon&quot; command to choose the effective distance
you need to throw it. Give yourself lots of room when you throw one; it
is just as deadly to you as it is to the other players.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In essence, you just need to remember three things;
Move, Think, Practice. Not everything I have said here will work for you.
It might even be totally against your style. Experiment with combinations
of weapons and items in a variety of situations, and above all have fun.

<P>Happy Fragging!!
