    <font SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The most basic weapon
and final resort one has is the <strong>combat knife</strong>.
When selected in teamplay you are awarded with ten. The knife is
a very versitle weapon. At long ranges you can switch to your
pistol to pick enemies off, at medium ranges you can use the
weapon command to throw your knives to cause some major damage. Once you learn how 
to arc your throws you can use them for nailing those pesky rooftop snipers. 
Knives penetrate kevlar vests and therefore make it a good medium
range weapon for those wearing them who decide it's a good idea
to rush you. The knife can also be used for slashing. This is
good for sneak attacks and close range battles with others who
may be unarmed or ammoless. The knife is also a great weapon
because thrown knives can be recovered and reused. The best items
to use with the knife is the <strong>bandolier</strong> and the <strong>slippers</strong>.
Some may not need the bandolier since you can retrieve tossed
knives, but I found that on certain levels it is a necessesity
when facing automatic weapon users. The bandolier is also very handy, now that it 
includes a pair of IR vision goggles and a hand grenade. The bandolier adds an extra
10 knives to your inventory and the slippers can be great for
sneaking up on unsuspecting victims and slicing their throats.<br>
<br>
The <strong>akimbo pistols</strong> pack quite a punch, but I
find it rather useless to select this weapon. When used with the <strong>bandolier</strong>
you have more than enough ammo to take out an entire team and the
accuracy to match. It could also work well with the <strong>kevlar
vest</strong>. The reason I don't see much use for selecting this
weapon is that every player comes equipped with a single pistol
and once you kill them you can take thiers and voila, you now
have akimbo pistols, plus your pre selected weapon. The accuracy has been improved somewhat in the 
latest version of action, so they are great weapons for style and can be used quite effectively if paired with the bandolier.<br>
<br>
The <strong>M3 assualt shotgun</strong> is a great weapon. Packs
almost as much punch as the handcannon at close range and has
decent locational damage at medium ranges. At one point, this wasn't a great
weapon choice for long range or wide open areas, but with the new and improved 
range and damage it's a good selection for any occasion. It works
great when taking out snipers and when navigating
corridors and other tight areas. The <strong>kevlar vest</strong>
does a good job of getting you in close enough to fill someone
full of buckshot and so do the <strong>stealth slippers</strong>.
I don't think their is much need for the bandolier, since you are
given plenty of ammo. For long range shots you should use your
pistol.<br>
<br>
The <strong>hand cannon</strong> is one powerful gun. Works
similar to the shotgun, but with less damage at medium range and
practically no damage dealt at long ranges. On the other hand it's
like running into a missle at close range. This is a difficult weapon to use, due 
to the amount of dodging, bobbing, and weaving, one has to do to close enough for it 
to be truly affective. Once again the <strong>kevlar
vest </strong>will come in handy for getting those close
encounters as do the <strong>stealth slippers</strong>. Use the
pistol for long range hit and hides.<br>
<br>
The <strong>MP5/10 sub machine gun</strong> is one of the more
popular weapons. This can be a great newbie weapon or experienced
weapon thanks to the 3 round burst option. It is however, slightly harder 
to use now, and you will not be clearing entire fields of enemies anymore. You still get 30 rounds and an extra clip though.
What more could you ask for? The <strong>kevlar</strong> works
great to compensate for aiming by giving second chances and the<strong>
laser sight</strong> works well in conjunction with 3 round burst.<br>
<br>
The <strong>M4 assualt rifle</strong> is like a more powerful
version of the sub machine gun. It does more damage, but it's
hard to control if you're inexperienced and it eats ammo quickly.
An easy counter to this is the 3 round burst option used with the
<strong>laser sight </strong>item. Adjusts your aim for precision
and helps conserve some of that end of round needed ammo. I
wouldn't recommend going kevlar on this one, due to the way it
goes through ammo. This weapon can't really be used to run and gun anymore and it's not as accurate 
as it used to be. It seems more affective if used as cover or overlapping fire. Stop and take aim.<br>
<br>
Finally the <strong>SSG 3000 sniper rifle</strong> is an awesome
weapon. Like the knife it penetrates the kevler vest, but not
only that, it can also penetrate bodies. While zoomed, it is extremely accurate under all 
conditions. The 4x
zoom works good in nearly all situations, and the 6x should only
be used at extremely long ranges or if lack of enemy exposure
calls for it. The 2x zoom can be used for picking off rushing
enemies or those at medium range who are showing alot of movement. Although it's cheesy, 
it's also helpful while moving from place to place.
A better idea for the sniping challenged, is to use your pistol when moving from place to
place. It's also a good idea to bind a button to adjust your
sensitivty so you can have pin point accuracy.</font></p>
