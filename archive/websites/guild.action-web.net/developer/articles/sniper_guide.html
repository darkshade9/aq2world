<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><br>Introduction</font></B>
<br><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, the SIG Sauer SSG 3000, your classic Bolt-Action sniper rifle capable of killing or at least seriously injuring someone with a single shot, no matter what they have on. That’s right, this is the only weapon in Action Quake 2 that uses Armor Piercing(AP) rounds allowing it to blast straight through Kevlar Vests. A shot on a vest won’t kill but it will knock your target down to 20 health or below. Add to that the fact that a single head or stomach shot will be a one hit kill and you see why the SSG is such a popular weapon. Of course I didn’t even mention those handy Zoom lenses yet. The weapon is not without it’s weaknesses though. First off, it’s the second slowest in the game, behind only the Handcannon. Second it’s worth in a close fight is nearly zip if your opponent is moving. Only the best Snipers will be able to consistantly kill at close range with the SIG Sauer. The pluses outway the minuses though and the Sig Sauer is one of the most powerful and popular weapon in AQ2 due to it’s flexibility.

<br>Item Choices</font>

<br>In Deathmatch this will not matter since your item choice will be whatever you can find. However, in teamplay item choice is just as important as weapon choice. Obviously if you are using a Handcannon and Silencer something is wrong with you. Here are the best choices for the Sniper Rifle.
<br>Kevlar Vest: The most flexible item in the game, works very well with the SIG Sauer. Although there are better choices for some maps, on brightly lit or wide open maps such as Cliff or Jungle1 this is your best bet as you are sure to be taking lots of fire.
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><br>Laser Sight:The laser sight does not work with the Sniper Rifle
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><br>Stealth Slippers: There is no real reason for this choice since you are a long range fighter and won’t need to sneak up on anyone. Could be interesting for Sniping on maps like Kumanru though.
<br>Silencer:Not nearly as effective as it was before v1.5, in fact there is no real reason to use it anymore unless you are on a server with IR Vision disabled. It doesn’t matter that no one cane hear you because to someone with IR Vision you are lit up like a Christmas Tree.
<br>Bandoiler: Another all purpose item. In addition to giving you extra ammo it provides grenades and IR Vision when they are enabled. IR Vision can be great on maps such as Urban2 where seeing pretty much anything is impossible. Makes a great combo for the SR on dark maps.
<br>Rob’s Recommendation:It depends, on open or bright maps you’ll want to go for the Vest, since stealth isn’t an option and seeing isn’t a problem. If the map is slightly dark(like blood) go for the Silencer, it will give you more chances to take out your target if you miss the first shot. On totally dark maps(like Urban2) go for the Bandoiler, the IR Vision is indespensible.

<br><font size=+2>The Basics</font>
<br><font size=+1>Shot Types</font>
<br>
<br>Yes, there are different types of shots for Snipers, something different from all other weapons. Experienced Snipers, stop giving me those strange looks. You use all the different shot types, you just don’t realize it.
<br>Stick-And-Move: The most common shot type. Snipers do it constantly, they just never realize what they are doing. This is when you step up to a ledge, aim fast, and let off a round before running back behind cover. This is what you should use most in the heat of battle as it allows you to get shots off fast and then get the hell out of your opponents sight!
<br>Glancing Shot: Another thing Snipers do naturally and don’t even realize. This is when you are moving positions and see someone out of the corner of your eye, you take a split-second to aim, then fire. It takes GREAT reflexes and aim to actually kill someone with one of these.
<br>Concentrated Kill: You don’t get many chances to do this.  You stop, crouch, take aim for the head or stomach and fire a sure kill. This is only for use when your opponent doesn’t see you and is standing still.  Never do this against a person when you are facing each other, unless he is concentrating on someone else. And NEVER do it if your target sees you.  Remember the Golden Rule, If You Can See Them, They Can See You.
<br>The Elusive 2 For 1: Not so much something that you can purposly do as it is a lucky shot that happens sometimes. Two opponents are standing one behind the other, you take a one in a million shot and hit, and hopefully kill, both.  Very Rare, but you’ll be feeling great for the rest of the day when you do it.

<br><font size=+1>General Tactics</font>
<br>
<br>Close Combat: It’s gonna happen sooner or later, no matter how hard you try to stop them, someone with an Auto or Shotty is gonna get in close. At this point it’s kinda balls to the wall and hope for the best. KEEP MOVING AND NEVER STOP! Stay in 2x, the second you leave 2x the Sniper Rifle will be affected by movement modifiers just like any other gun, but if you are in 2x bullets will fly straight whether you are standing still or jumping. Lead just a tad and try to anticipate where your opponent will be in a second, then put a bullet there to meet him. Move erratically, don’t let your opponent anticipate where you are going, or he’ll be shooting there.
<br>Moving: Staying in one place is dumb, if your opponent knows where you are, that’s where their crosshairs are going to be. Unless you are on a high roof and/or have someone watching your back you should move every few minutes. Stay in 2x, non-snipers complain about this, but the fact is it give you a tactical advantage, so use it. Never run in a straight line, always assume a sniper is trying to shoot you. Run, strafe, and jump until you get to your new position, then get behind cover and get ready to fight again.
<br>Reloading: Don’t always wait until you are out of ammo to reload, unlike most other weapons your gun reloads one round at a time, not by clip. Use that to your advantage, if you get a break in the action, refil your gun. If you hear that dreaded *<B>click</B>* in the middle of a fight, follow the tips of close combat while you are reloading.
<br>Cover: Just like every other weapon, cover is important. The second Golden Rule, If They Can’t See You, They Can’t Kill You. Use crates, walls, buildings, or doors as cover during fights. Peek out, aim, take your shot, then get back behind your cover.


<br><font size=+1>Advanced Tactics</font>
<br>

<br>Aim: What? What the hell is so advanced about aim!? Well, give me a chance to explain. When you take aim, you should take into account the damage you will do against the likeliness of a connecting shot. Never aim at someone’s legs or chest when they are standing still and never aim at someone’s head when they are moving. Got that? Good. As you play you will discover that the prime area to aim at is the stomach, it’s MUCH easier to hit than the head and is still a 1 hit kill. Sure they live long enough to fire back, but most of the time they will panic and besides, by that time you should be safely back behind cover.
<br>Bandaging: Boy, these advanced tactics seem pretty basic, no? Well, just play along. Bandaging for a Sniper is sometimes a tough  decision. To bandage or not to bandage, that is the question. Well it all depends on the severity of your wound. If you duck behind cover to bandage you could easily lose your target. If you are only down to 70+ and aren’t bleeding bad, take a couple shots at the other guy, THEN bandage. If you fall below 60, it’s uaully a good idea to bandage first, THEN go for payback. Never bandage a Sniper Stomach shot or MP5 headshot, you are gonna die regardless.
<br>Keeping Your Cool: A steady hand and cool head are absolutly necessary for Sniping. You are going to be shot at...a lot, over the course of a game. It is important that you are calm enough to make a decision as to whether or not the fire poses an immediate threat or not. If bullets are giving you a haircut and wiping the sweat off your ass, then MOVE! Get behind cover! If they aren’t anywhere near, fire back and make them take cover. In the end, it’s your decision whether or not gunfire poses a threat or not. Another thing that requires you to remain calm is a deadly wound. I mean a Stomach shot with a Sniper Rifle or a Headshot with an MP5. If you panic you will die in vein. If you stay calm, most of the time you can take them with you.
<br>Sniper Wars: Man, these can be fun, they can also be the most difficult fight you encounter. As long as you play smart you should come out alive though.  First off, if you’ve got an elevated position, you have the advantage, remember that. If your opponent has the elevated position just be very careful, they may be going for a headshot even though you think you are concealed. You’ll want to stick to Stick-And-Move shots in this kind of situation, don’t stay still, and don’t keep sticking your head out in the same spot, move around. Run in, take quick aim, fire, then get back. Be fast and be accurate, that’s what it takes to win a Sniper War. Be patient, too, if you have to peck away by shooting their legs until they die, then do it! Don’t try to get the 1 hit kill against a Sniper, just get the kill and don’t become it.
<br>Zoom Lenses: Zoom lenses can be the difference between a kill and a hole in your head. Knowing when to use what Lense is key to being an efficient Sniper and if you like the Sniper rifle, a Zoom alias is a MUST. 2x is where you should stay when you aren’t targeting a specific person. It gives you the widest FOV and it’s sensitivity is perfect for scanning the area. 4x is what you should use when you are targeting someone far away and can’t quite get a good view of him. Move up to 4x and he’ll be crystal clear and your shot will be easier. 6x is pretty useless I personally never use it. Maybe useful on really huge maps, but if you use a Voodoo2 card you won’t be able to see far enough to justify using this thing anyway. Just stay away from 6x cuz on top of all that the sensitivity is a real bitch.

<br>

<br>You’re gonna want these trust me, the Sniper Rifle is one of the few weapons that makes good use of cfg alias’ Use these, trust me the Zoom Alias’ are something you won’t be able to live without!
<br>Deltree’s Zoom In/Out Alias: Ripped right off of the Actor’s Guild(hehe :) this is a great alias that allows you to zoom in and out. Very cool, cuz pressing the &quot;weapon&quot; key 3 times to go from 4x to 2x sucks hard. Credit to Deltree for this config.(converted to HTML by RobVanDam{CFH})

<br>alias in1x &quot;weapon; set sensitivity 10; alias in in2x; alias out out2x&quot;
<br>alias out1x &quot;weapon; weapon; weapon; set sensitivity 10; alias in in2x; alias
<br>out out2x&quot;
<br>alias in2x &quot;weapon; set sensitivity 7; alias in in4x; alias out out1x&quot;
<br>alias out2x &quot;weapon; weapon; weapon; set sensitivity 7; alias in in4x; alias

<br>bind q &quot;out&quot; // zoom out from 1x-6x-4x-2x-1x</DIR>

<br>Emergency Sensitivity Reset: The Sniper Rifle can screw you sensitivity up sometime, you should have an emergency reset key bound at all times.
<br>bind x(replace with key of your choice) &quot;sens_reset&quot;
<br>Zoom AliasThis is it, EVERY Sniper should have this Alias in his config. Hell,
<br>this damn thing should be required for you to use the Sniper Rifle, the bind
<br>takes up a bunch of keys, but if you are Sniping it is a must have. Binding
<br>them is left to you, use it wisely young one. This is nothing revelutionary
<br>but the alias found here is from KillingBox[LH]’s config.(Converted To HTML By
<br>RobVanDam{CFH})
<br>alias &quot;1x&quot; &quot;weapon;sensitivity $1xsens;echo 1x;alias zoomin 2x;alias zoomout

<br>zoomin 6x;alias zoomout 4xdn&quot;
<br>Sensitivity Settings: Not really a bind, but it’s important that the Mouse Sensitivity settings for the Sniper Rifle work for you, adjust these settings to suit your needs. Settings from Trevor Atchison’s AQ2 Config(found at The Actor’s Guild)(Converted to HTML by RobVanDam{CFH})

<br>set 1x_sens &quot;12&quot; // Mouse sensitivity at 1x zoom
<br>set 2x_sens &quot;8&quot;  // Mouse sensitivity at 2x zoom
<br>set 4x_sens &quot;6&quot;  // Mouse sensitivity at 4x zoom
<br>set 6x_sens &quot;3&quot;  // Mouse sensitivity at 6x zoom
