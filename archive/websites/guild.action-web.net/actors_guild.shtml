I'm not sure if it's going to be two different pages, or all one, those details will be sorted out later.  The main point is, there probably aren't going to be any updates until the new site is finished.  I have a handful of submissions on me right now, and I will upload those either tonight or tomorrow, but that will be it for a while.  From looking at the page, and the ftp for the Guild, it is nothing but a mess.

It's a client side thing, so you can try it if you want!!  You need Opengl 1.1 drivers for your card<br><br><font color="red">This morning by fluke (I was switching the shotgun model) I found out that you can get the fog from CGF and LTK working in regular multiplayer games. <P>Fog:  <A HREF="http://www.botepidemic.com/aid/cgf/shots/riot_fog1.jpg" TARGET=_blank>http://www.botepidemic.com/aid/cgf/shots/riot_fog1.jpg</A>  <A HREF="http://www.botepidemic.com/aid/cgf/shots/monastery1.jpg" TARGET=_blank>http://www.botepidemic.com/aid/cgf/shots/monastery1.jpg</A> <P>Default opengl users can skip next 2 paragraphs.<P>3dfx users can get this working too. Just download the mini gl used in GlQuake (opengl.dll), put it in your quake2 directory and change from 3dfx gl to default gl. On my P200 I got an extra 1.5 fps. I use default opengl all the time now. There are no visible diferences either. Get the latest GLQuake opengl.dll: <A HREF="http://tux.telefragged.com/file.pl?filename=opengl32.dll&dir=telefragged/actionworld/kram/" TARGET=_blank>http://tux.telefragged.com/file.pl?filename=opengl32.dll&dir=telefragged/actionworld/kram/</A> <P>After you put you stick that in your quake2 folder go into regular quake2 and change the video setting. Then when you go into action it will have the right settings. (BTW, when you play CGF you gotta rename the opengl.dll to something different or CGF will crash).<P>Now goto <A HREF="http://www.botepidemic.com/aid/cgf" TARGET=_blank>http://www.botepidemic.com/aid/cgf</A>   and download the latest client/server pack. You only need the folder /action/cgf/fog if you dont want the whole thing. Then goto <A HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/maxtron/ltk/" TARGET=_blank>http://www.planetquake.com/maxtron/ltk/</A>  and download the latest LTK dll. Stick it in you quake2 folder (backing up 1.52 and CGF). <P>Edit /action/cgf/fog to your liking (my default one is: default 0.09 1 0.1 0.1 0.1 200 2200), set fog 1 in your config, start up AQ2 with the ltk dll, start a game, the bots will join, disconnect and join an internet game. You will have fog. yay. Once you start a map with the bots and the fog every game after will have the fog. Pretty nifty. <br></font><br>I agree, that's pretty nifty.<br></font></td></tr></table>

In other news.... Red13 emailed me about taking over, so i gave gim my ICQ UIN but he hasn't replied. I also got a new aq2 song, and it's upped to the others section. If you people are wondering what has been keeping me from my webbing duties, check out my schools new website, authored by yours truly. Now for a little rant. I play a lot of CS and some AQ2 with my clan, and whenever I join a server people talk about how my name is Gigolo, and that new Rob Schneider movie Duece Bogalow Male Gigolo. First of all, the title is redudant. Look up gigolo in the dictionary and male is in the definition. I also hope that a lot of people don't start going by that name. I hate it when some new movie or tv show comes out and everyone uses a name from it. There were numerous southpark clans, and i see tons of people with the names of morpheus, majorpayne, blade, spawn and just about any other movie hero/heroine. Call it a pet peeve of mine, I just think that originality is a defining characteristic and more people should look into it, that's all. Well, I know a lot of you dont appreciate me not updating in over a month, and then ranting on and on forever, but oh well.</font></td></tr></table>

Been really busy, and there are just way too many files. This is what I have planned to do. I am going to release all of the files that I have in a zip. <a href="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/guild/optionals/11-5-99update.zip">Here is a link.</a> If someone out there wants to apply for a position here at the guild, take the zip and update the crosshair, weapon skins, etc pages with these new additions. If you do this, send it to me and we can talk about you taking some work off of my hands. The HTML files are in the zip. Vivitronak is back at the Guild, and he is updated the models section a few weeks ago, so if you haven't checked that out swing on by. I will continue to just update by zip file, unless I get inspired again or if someone helps me out. I got here by volunteering, so it isn't impossible. Oh, as I was sitting down to write this I got an email, here it is :<BR><br><font color="red">I seriously don't understand this. At first you were oh so very enthusiastic about updating and keeping the guild alive. Now that you got you ADSL and can frag at sub 100 pings you forget about the rest of us? Where are new optionals? Im sure you have a stash piled up somewhere but won't put em up for god knows why. Its been over a friggin month. I check back everyday in  hope that i can add something exciting to aq2 and yet promote its life further. Unfortunately people like you are seeming to busy and pampered to care anymore. Either deliver the goods or resign.</font><br><br>To anyone that feels this way also, all I can say is that I do this for FREE. I design webpages and work on computers as a side job, and I get money to do it, damn good money. I do this website for FREE. I have not recieved one dime from the Guild. Everything I have done was for you, for the community that I watched grow since I was a beta tester with the A-team. If you want things to change, you gotta change em. If you want the Guild to kick ass again, do something about it. Drop me a line and let's see what WE can do to fix it. That's all.<br> <FONT COLOR=#808080>The guy who sent that email is Francis Holmes: fholmes64@hotmail.com .  </FONT></font></td></tr></table>

There are some other things that I am working on, like a 1on1 aq2 map. Once I finish it expect to see it somewhere, even if AQMD won't house it. That's all for today.<FONT COLOR=#808080>Over 30 optionals to upload, damnable procrastination. Bloodhound Gang rocks your lame ass!!!</FONT></font></td></tr></table>

I got some news for ya though. I am gonna be taking the reigns from Hammer from now on. He is still gonna help around here, just not on the same level as he used to. I am trying to convert the Pic of the Day to the Pic of the Week, and it isn't working too well. Email me if you are having any problems with it. Also, please send all files that goto me to samm@texas.net, not the submit2guild one. Also, with my ADSL you can send me pretty much any size file and it won't faze the mighty bandwidth. Keep sending in the optionals, the pic's and all the rest, we are still alive, just in hibernation. I should be updating the pic and the optionals section sometime soon. I got like 30 optionals to upload, including two new songs!! Look for it soon.<FONT COLOR=#808080>With my new sexy ping I am more or less unstoppable in AQ2. If anyone wants to challenge me in that, then challenge clan11, www.clan11.com, and see if you can take us on.</FONT></font></td></tr></table>
