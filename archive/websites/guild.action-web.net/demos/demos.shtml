	<DL>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now maybe it's because I am not too good at AQ2, but I have never seen these jumps 
	that [US]Sabotage does on Urban. DOWNLOAD THIS NOW!! It isn't recammed but he used a demo editor cause 
	there are some effects in it. Check it out, it rocks. Also, if anyone out there is good at keygrip2 and 
	wants to work on some demos with ol Gig then drop me a line. For some reason keygrip really screws up my 
	computer, so I don't use it. A blee a blee a blee thats all folks.<FONT COLOR=#808080>If a girl says she's

	<DL>You might be asking yourself, "What is Gigolo doing here in the Demo's section?". Well, 
	for some reason people send me demo's. So here I am. I upped Headshot a while back, and
	I also got some jump demos for Urban3 and rh_station. Those are at the "Movie Action" section, so check em
	out. Bye for now.

	<DL>Yep we're back once again. The demo's are not flying in at the moment and i'm wondering
	if anyone is rolling the camera's at all. I had a few submissions but some of them were not
	really that good and others we're about making special jumps. I'm still in negotiation with 
	Awol from <a href=http://stunt.stomped.com/ Target="_new">Stunt Double</A> about who should 
	have the stunts on his page, so for now keep sending them to me as well as to him. And please
	, please pretty please don't make make me watch anymore Urban jumps because i have seen them
	ALL by now. Ok that's it keep them coming and i'll put em up. (that is, if they are good)

	<DL>The Demo section of the Guild page is up and running again. So we want to you to send your demos
	that you have recorded and/or edited. Kissmet went Snowboarding and is no longer the author of this
	section. New authors are Xineon (that's me) and Mr.Wolf. You can send your demos to <a href="mailto:demo@xineon.arenanet.fi" target="_blank">this</a>
	address. The same rules apply as before. The demos shouldn't be bigger than 750kb zipped and they have to be zipped.
	If you haven't recammed your demo, it is unlikely that the demo will be posted unless you do something spectacular in it.<br><br>
	If you sent us a demo and we haven't released it, please do not mail us asking why it wasn't released
	(the most likely reason is that it wasnt good enough).
	If you've never edited a demo and want to do it, I suggest you download KeyGrip2 from
	<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/keygrip" target="_blank">PlanetQuake</a> and read its tutorial.
	I dont want you to mail me with questions how to edit demos. You'll get the general idea from the tutorial.

	<DL>Good morning everyone :) I'm about to leave for the easter (I'll be back next Sunday
	(4/4/99)) I've been talking to <EM>AWOL</EM> at
	<a href=http://stunt.stomped.com/ Target="_new">Stunt Double</A>
	lately and we are going to try to clearify who did the diffrent jumps first etc.
	You might want to check out hes site too, as he is posting jumps I won't post,
	however he just moved the site to <a href=http://www.stomped.com/ Target="_new2">stomped</a> so
	you'll have to be patient :))

	<DL>So now you know what the demo page will look like, that is if Suislide liked this :) There
	are at the moment two sections here, <em>Action Bible</em> and <em>Move Action</em>.<BR><BR>
	<DL>The <em>Action Bible</em> will be a series off teaching/hint demos on different maps, it
	will show you the jumps in a chase camera / mounted camera and the original demo will also be
	include in the zip file. Chapter one will be out tomorrow (were supposed to be out today but it
	seams KeyGrip2 deleted all my jpg files in the action/scrnshot/folder).</DL><BR>
	<DL>The <em>Movie Action</em> will be a section where you can send in demos, both unedited and
	edited demos, this is were you will show off your playing abilities or a nice kill. I'm going to
	start accepting demos here really soon, if you got anything that is really good mail it to
	<A HREF=MailTo:lorddark@c2i.net>me</A>. (Right now I won't download anything that's not ZiP'ed
	nor will I download anything more than 750 Kb. If you can't meet those two requirements, please
	do not mail me!)
