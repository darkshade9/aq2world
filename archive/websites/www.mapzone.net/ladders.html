      <p>To make your brushes climbable in <b>Reaction Quake 3</b>, a shader must 
        be applied to the brush you'd like climbable. To get this to work on a 
        simple ladder that only has a texture applied to it, you'd need to make 
        a shader file or add on to an existing one if you're more experienced 
        with shaders. For this example, our ladder is covered with the <b>gothic_ceiling/woodceiling1a</b> 
        texture, but we'll need to make a shader for this. Create a text file 
        called <b>rq3laddy</b>, and paste this text from this <a href="files/ladder.txt">text 
        file</a> into it. Now, save it and rename <b>rq3laddy.txt</b> to <b>rq3laddy.shader</b> 
        and place that into <b>/quake3path/baseq3/scripts</b> then open up the 
        <b>shaderlist.txt</b> file in that folder, scroll down to the last line 
        and add <b>rq3laddy</b>. All done, now save the updated <b>shaderlist.txt 
        </b>file, load up your map editor and apply <b>gothic_ceiling/woodceilingladder</b> 
        to the simple ladder you made. It will now have the <b>gothic_ceiling/woodceiling1a</b> 
        texture applied to it, and it'll be climbable.</p>
      <p>Another way to make an area climbable is to make a brush and cover it 
        with the <b>Ladder Shader</b> provided below, which uses a special texture 
        to make it easier to see where the ladder brush is. Just save the <b>ladder.shader</b> 
        file below into /quake3path/baseq3/scripts and add the word <b>ladder 
        </b>to the last line of the <b>shaderlist.txt </b>in that folder, save 
        that and you're ready to make an invisible ladder(Save the ladderclip.tga 
        file to /quake3path/baseq3/textures/common - Then when you load up Radiant 
        just load the /textures/common directory and you should see &quot;ladder&quot; 
        there). The advantage to this is if you only want a part of the ladder 
        climbable, just shape the brush to however you want the player to be able 
        to climb upon, and put the ladder shader on it. In Radiant there should 
        be a translucent brush covered with the word &quot;ladder&quot;, now the 
        player will be able to climb on that, so place it against a wall or ladder 
        to use it effectively.</p>
