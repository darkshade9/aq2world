          off, No Beta test maps will be accepted unless they come from, or are 
          brought to our attention by the mapper. Now, I would also suggest that 
          all maps are also sent to the AQMD. The AQMD plays an important part 
          in the Action community, they test maps, we don't. Please remember that 
          the testers at AQMD are all experienced players and quite a few are 
          mappers. All they can do is help you.</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>If you 
          have no intention of submitting the map to AQMD please explain the reasons 
          to me, as I keep in contact with the AQMD staff it would be helpful 
          for me to know.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>I am 
          not worried about &quot;illegal&quot; textures, but the use of them 
          will keep you from getting the map tested at AQMD and will also result 
          in your map not being included in any future AQ2-related CD-ROMs that 
          may be provided to the public by the AQ2 team."</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>If the 
          map is to be submitted to both the AQMD and the MapZone, I would ask 
          that you follow the <a href="http://aqmd.action-web.net/mmaps.shtml" target="">submission 
          guidelines</a> setup by the AQMD. In addittion to these guidelines I 
          would ask that you also include something in the name that signifies 
          that the map is a beta. A good example of this is Vertigo, which was 
          first submitted as Vertigo_1h. The name of the zip should be changed 
          as well as the name of the .bsp. </b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>If you 
          come across a map that looks good, but wasn't designed specifically 
          for Action let me know. Send me an <a href="mailto:smoke@mapzone.net">e-mail</a> 
          and include a brief description and a place I can download the map, 
          also include the authors name if possible.</b></font></p>

          Shot Submissions: I am still looking for screen shots. Here's what I 
          want:<br>
          1. all shots should be on empty maps.<br>
          2. all shots should be renamed after the map.<br>
          3. I reserve the right to crop and edit the shots as I see fit, mostly 
          this is just for adjusting the file size.</b></font></p>
