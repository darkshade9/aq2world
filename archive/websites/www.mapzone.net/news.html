                using MapZone as the home site for the clan, match info, etc.. 
                but =CHPB= is much much more than just an FPS clan. BadAim has 
                been working on a website to reveal the other side of CHPB which 
                really is a long story so i will leave that for another time, 
                now its time to work!</font></p>

                time no see everyone. Things have been pretty slow with no maps 
                being submitted yet but there are a few in the works that should 
                be ready to test soon. Ive been out and about try to spread the 
                word that MapZone is back as well as seeking out mappers. In following 
                with the Action mods we will also soon handle AHL and UT/AUT maps 
                as well. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="FFCC00">Right 
                now im kinda glad that things are a little slow, Its given me 
                the chance to work on the server which is running AQ2 v1.52 FF 
                - TP on 27910, by this weekend i will also have DM running on 
                27911. Once I have them running properly I want to add AQ:TE v4.3d 
                to bring things up to date. <br>
                <br>
                When I was hacked i lost everything so will have to re-install 
                the UT server as well wich will probably take a while since I 
                am pretty new to Linux. I finally got my Half-Life cd to work 
                which had been giving me errors on my windows machine so I will 
                also <i>hopefully</i> get Half-Life on the server before Beta 
                4.0 is released for Action. </font></p>

              more. I finally got the software I needed to complete the Navbar, 
              some russians hacked my server and we had some problems on the message 
              boards. Its been quite an exhausting few weeks. Smoke tells me he's 
              getting into AHL maps now so we might be seeing some pop up on the 
              list here soon. If anyone has any suggestions on the Navbar let 
              me know, it was a first try, experimenting with the software mainly 
              and the capabilities.</font></td>

              folks, things have been moving along slowly but surely. Ive made 
              some changes to the graphics, added a few pages (only 3 more to 
              go) and fixed the mapZone test server port. Its running the same 
              maps as AQ2Zone but its set to DM. This weekend I will be removing 
              all of the legal maps and installing all of the unapproved maps. 
              Eventually the map name will have a screenshot next to it so you 
              sorta know what youre downloading, or if you can get ahold of me 
              I'll run it on the server for you. I also ran into some software 
              problems so the navbar might not be finished for a while but for 
              the most part the site is up and running and will be ready for maps 
              this Monday.<br>

              Welcome everyone, I got the first post! Most of you who have been 
              around for a while know what MapZone is, for those who dont, Mapzone 
              was a site to keep unapproved AQ2 and AHL maps, to give the mappers 
              suggestions, hints and feedback to help people improve their maps, 
              get them one step closer to being AQMD approved... or not. With 
              this reconstruction I am adding another AQ2 port on my server that 
              will be dedicated to Beta maps only. For the time being we will 
              only be looking at AQ2 maps.<br>
              Ive also recruited the help of Agent Smoke who will answer all the 
              hard questions.. heh j/k, Smoke has been helping me put the site 
              together</font> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC00">and 
              giving me ideas to make this site as easy to navigate and understand 
              as possible.</font> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              <font color="FFCC00">We are launching this site a little early so 
              we can get some feedback and opinions on what the players/mappers 
              would like to see on the site. <br>
