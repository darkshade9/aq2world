        started as a site to store unofficial maps (maps with borrowed textures) 
        because AQMD could no longer post these &quot;illegal&quot; maps. We as 
        players would like to see better maps, and more of them, its part of what 
        keeps the game interesting. We have setup a port to give mappers more 
        play time for their maps and more tips and hints or suggestions. Most 
        of the people who will be playing these maps have been around since the 
        beginning of Action so we have seen a lot of maps come and go.</b></font>

      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MapZone 
        is a sister site of ActionZone, formerly known as the AQ2Zone, Both sites 
        have been around for almost 2 years now, created and operated by fans 
        of the Action mod in an effort to spread the popularity of the game. The 
        ActionZone and MapZone are not associated with the A-Team in any way but 
        we have always worked to be an asset to the community and to ensure Its 
        growth. </font></b></p>
