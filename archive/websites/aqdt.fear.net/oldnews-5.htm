   <P>WTC/Pentagon - <small>September 12th, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>AQDT would like to extend our condolences to those affected by the World Trade 
      Center and Pentagon attacks.  It is indeed a sad day when some members of 
      humanity can plan and carry out such a thing.</P>

   <P>So what's new? - <small>September 8th, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>AQDT is in hiatus mode.  Look for some code updates October-ish.  RL issues have
      poor old Hal working on that X-box game.  Try as I might, he won't quit the job
      to work on ETE fulltime.  Selfish bastard!  Anyway, in the Forums we are recording
      suggestions and any bugs/issues that people find so that we can evaluate them when
      Hal gets the time to implement some of them in a few weeks.  If you have ANY 
      feedback, PLEASE post in the forums or email to me at superproz@aol.com with the 
      subject "ETE FEEDBACK" and I'll be super-happy!</P>
   <P>We're not dead, just kinda busy.  Most reports have ETE 4.4a as pretty dang stable 
      and bug-free, which kicks ass!  :)</P>

   <P>4.4a ETE is RELEASED! - <small>August 3rd, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>HO HA.  FINALLY.  I went through all the scenarios and support files.
      Everything should be good to go now.  Everything except for the AQ:Arena
      and Lowlag packages has been updated, even the Espionage Skin Pack.</P>
   <P>Do yourself a favor and just get the Espionage Support Pack.  It has 
      EVERYTHING you need.  The server binaries, the docs, the skins, the lowlag
      sounds.  Just remember, RENAME THE "pakN.pak" FILE TO SOMETHING LIKE "pak9.pak"!</P>
   <P>Thanks for bearing with my slowness... please let me know how you like
      4.4a!  Or post in the Forums.  :)</P>

   <P>4.4a ETE is complete! - <small>July 26th, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Sorry to everyone, but I've been slammed with job stuff lately and haven't
      had the time to release 4.4a.  Which is good, because 4.4 has a minor issue
      that was fixed in 4.4a.  :)</P>
   <P>I'm updating the docs now and preparing the new packages.  I'm also checking
      the scenarios to make sure they are all "fixed" and proper.  The old ones had
      some minor errors that only manifested themselves in later versions of ETE.
      Oddly enough, I guess ETE got more strict in the scenario parsing so the old
      errors that didn't matter before suddenly mattered.</P>
   <P>Some of the new features of ETE 4.4a:</P>
   <UL>
   <LI>Deathmatch spawn protection--helps eliminate spawn camping
   <LI>Enhanced Referee function for TE and ETE modes
   <LI>TE mode can work with Teamplay AND Espionage modes now, nicely too
   <LI>Some various "rcon sv" commands that are of use
   <LI>Lowlag sounds can be disabled (why would you want to?)
   <LI>Some new % commands, %%, %K, %D
   <LI>Anti-name impersonation safeguard
   <LI>End of round FF, shoot and kick your teammates!<BR>
       (idea from Gamblor or JBravo, I forget) 
   <LI>Other random stuff y'all don't care about.  :)

   <P>4.4 ETE is complete! - <small>July 10th, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>The binary is compiled, alls I gots to do now is whip up some download
      packages and y'all should be good to go!  Check back in the next few days
      since I'll probably have it all done and released then.</P>
   <P>A hell of a big THANK YOU goes out to Hal9000, without whom 4.4 would never
      have seen the light of day.  I appreciate your work, Hal, and I'm sure 
      everyone else thanks you too!  :)</P>

   <P>4.4 in limited testing - <small>July 4th, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>4.3x looked good, so now we're doing a limited test of the 4.4-release 
      server binaries.  If those are good to go, in about a week or so 4.4 will 
      be available for download along with updated docs and support files.</P>

   <P>Yeah, there was a 4.3w, but I was too lazy to update the site.  4.3x is 
      now in testing and if this sucker is good to go, then that's a wrap for 4.4.</P>

   <P>4.3u in testing - <small>June 9th, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Fixes a couple of subtle random number bugs. This is the current 
      release candidate, so if no bugs pop up, this one goes out the door 
      as 4.4. So, like, go play on Pearl Mankey (pearlmankey.dhs.org 
      and pearlmankey2.dhs.org) and stuff.</P>

   <P>4.3t in testing - <small>May 7th, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>4.3t is in testing now.  Mainly some deathmatch and Espionage tweaks
      so it shouldn't affect most people.  This is still a closed beta test.
      We do thank you for your interest, though, and Hal is working on ETE
      when he gets the chance, but is also busy with other commitments and
      whatnot.  Hopefully a release version will come soon, but we'd rather
      release a version that's rock-solid stable and won't give anyone any 
      problems.  Hopefully we'll have that soon.  :)</P>

   <P>4.3s in testing - <small>April 24th, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>4.3s is in testing now.  It fixes just about all outstanding issues.
      Lookin' good, I think this might be "it".  Both I and Hal have been 
      extremely busy as of late, hence the lack of updates.  I can't code
      to save my life, either, so even if I weren't busy I couldn't update
      ETE.  :)  I'll try to keep ya'll posted.  With 4.3s, all Espionage 
      problems appear to have been solved which is a Very Good Thing.</P>

   <P>Espionage server setup - <small>April 4th, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Gah!  People have no patience!  I'll put up a "how to make an espionage
      server" section in the online docs sometime soon.  But be aware that any 
      espionage server you currently set up will have a messed up Capture and Hold
      scenario.  It's in the code, it seems.  That's why I haven't really been
      pimping or encouraging espionage servers just yet...  when everything is 
      fixed there will be that happy "support package" I said I'd make.</P>
   <P ALIGN="right">- <A HREF="mailto:superproz@aol.com">Black Monk</A></P>

   <P>One step closer... - <small>March 31st, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>4.3s is being worked on.  Remember what I said about running out of letters?</P>
   <P>There's a new ESPIONAGE server running at 129.105.122.75:27900 and you'll need
      some player skins and models.  The models can found in the "Downloads" section 
      on the left.  Get the Espionage 3.3 client package.  Install it.  There will be 
      a file named pakN.pak.  Rename it to something like pak9.pak.  DO THIS.</P>
   <P>A list of skins used by the most common scenarios can be found here:</P>
   <P><A HREF="aqdtdocs/script4.htm">Skins used in most Espionage scenarios</A></P>
   <P>If you want to download these aforementioned skins, there is a link to 'em
      in the "Downloads" section.  In the future the 3.3 and skins packages will
      be combined into one nice, handy "support" download.  But that's in a 
      few weeks when ETE gets out of beta and is released.  Until then, this 
      should hold ya'll over for a bit.</P>

   <P>One step closer... - <small>March 20th, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>4.3p has been put into beta testing, if this sucker is solid after people
      bang around on it for a week I think it'll be good to go.  Not much other
      news at the moment.</P>

   <P>Doh!  I was kidding! - <small>March 12th, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Just in case there are any misunderstandings, the "rocket launcher" and
      "laser trip mines" comment was a joke, they are NOT GOING INTO ETE.</P>
   <P>Sorry for any confusion.  :\</P>

   <P>Next official ETE release (not beta) almost here... - <small>March 11th, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>4.3n is in testing right now.  It fixes the last of the outstanding
      bugs/issues that we know about.  It's in limited testing now with 
      {TGr}WarMachine and may or may not pop up on the Pearl Mankey servers.
      Yes, Pearl Mankey, the official beta test server of the AQDT!
      Errr, anyway, if this version is rock-solid and there are no new 
      features to implement (i.e., rocket launcher and laser trip mines), 
      then it will probably be released as official when Hal gets around 
      to it.  Testing is hampered by the fact that many players and server 
      admins are on school vacation over the next week or two here in USA.
      Once the final server binaries are released, we'll look into doing a 
      Macintosh port, I'll finish up the ETE Docs, and I'll finalize and post
      the "ETE Support Package" for downloading.  Scenarios, models, ML locations
      and other good stuff, you know how it goes.</P>

      Anyway, be patient, good stuff will appear soon enough.  There 
      May be some goodies appearing in the Scenario Depot in the upcoming
      weeks.  I'll post if/when that happens.  Other than that, AQDT ain't

   <P>Yo, so what's up? - <small>February 28th, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>A goodly amount of bugfixes and polish has been done to the latest beta, 4.3m.
      I updated the docs a small amount, nothing to really notice--just some stuff 
      about the "REFEREE" function in TE mode.  Some client command stuff has 
      been updated about "impersonationok" and I think that's about it.  4.4a should
      be ready soon since at this rate we'll run out of beta letters!  ;)</P>

      Sorry for any inconvenience you may suffer, but you can get most of the stuff in the
      3.3 files available for download and the online docs.</P>

   <P>ETE Docs fix and request for ML locations - <small>February 21st, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Thanks go to fex who spotted a boo-boo I made with the ETE Docs link.  
      He fixed it and all is good and happy now.</P>
   <P>Also, if anyone is interested in making ML location files, please let me know.
      This would benefit AQ:ETE and also AQ:ML since they both use the same format now.
      You must use the AQ:ML server binary to create the location files, but both ETE and
      ML can use the resulting files.  :)</P>

   <P>Old News! - <small>February 20th, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Hey, got all the old news ported to the revamped website.  Interesting stuff.</P>
   <P ALIGN="right">- <A HREF="mailto:superproz@aol.com">Black Monk</A></P>

   <P>Clarification - <small>February 21st, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Oh, and just to clarify for you people who haven't been at the AQDT site in ages...
      Homer redesigned the entire site back in November or earlier.  I recently just 
      mucked around with some things, adding links, making the ETE Docs and putting 
      them online--but the basic site design and look and feel was done by Homer months ago.</P>
   <P>Just for a comparison, this is how the AQDT website looked before Homer did the site
      redesign:</P>

   <P>New AQDT member - <small>February 19th, 2001</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Um, it's me!  :)  I'll be adding some goodies to the website and doing some other things.</P>
   <P>Revised docs for AQ:ETE are pretty much done, they'll make their way online.  
      There will be a new client/server package made available for download that will 
      include the new docs, Espionage models, sounds, and scenarios, and LowLag sounds.</P>
   <P>This is NOT AQ:ETE 4.4, but it will still be valid when 4.4 is released.  This is 
      a recommended download for EVERYONE, even if you already have some of these files.  
      They have been updated, tweaked, and made happy.  This applies to clients/players 
      <I>and</I> server ops.  When a new AQ:ETE server binary is released, all you do is 
      drop it into the distribution that you already downloaded and BOOM you're set!</P>
   <P>Anyway, more to come...</P>
