   <P>AQ: Tournament Edition - Update ( 0.92 ) - <small>June 9th, 1999</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Ok, sometime tonight or tomorrow we'll have 0.92 in Win32 and linux versions. 
      This is a supported release, not an unsupported beta, so feel free to email me 
      at the link above or inghaw (for linux problems) at 
      <A HREF="mailto:inghaw@fear.net">inghaw@fear.net</A></P>

   <P>Basically, this version is stable and pretty much exploit-free (the last few will 
      be fixed in 0.93).</P>

   <P>Also, welcome Inghaw to the offical ranks of the AQDT, he's actually humble, 
      which might balance out Fool Killer finally :ï¿½.</P>

   <P>AQ: Tournament Edition - Update ( 0.91beta ) - <small>May 25th, 1999</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Ok, 0.91 is done, fixing most stupid stuff I did, and NT compatible, and blah 
      blah blah. Linux problems should be addressed to 
      <A HREF="mailto:inghaw@fear.net">inghaw@fear.net</A>  To get the linux version 
      click here or for the Windows version (which now works under NT) click here.</P>

   <P>Again, for those who just want to play TE, check out the online Readme.</P>

   <P>Next version will have a menu to handle all the new settings and cvars. Also 
      some other stuff. Suggestions and requests are still welcome.</P>

   <P>AQ: Tournament Edition - Update - <small>May 19th, 1999</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>AQ: Tournament Edition v0.9beta was released Saturday, but we managed to mess 
      things up.  We now have the right versions working, thanks to inghaw (who also 
      made the initial error in compiling the wrong source! Spam mail should be 
      directed to <A HREF="mailto:inghaw@fear.net">inghaw@fear.net</A> ) 
      To get the REAL linux version click here or for the Windows version 
      (which now works under NT) click here. Again, it'll be on ftp as soon as possible.</P>

   <P>New Project: AQ: Tournament Edition - <small>May 15th, 1999</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Wow, we seem to keeping up with our bimonthly site updates! ;)</P>

   <P>AQ: Tournament Edition v0.9beta is now out in Win32 and Linux versions.   
      This is a long delayed project of mine, working with Black Cross [NL] 
      from AQ:G-Team.  We're working on adding the few features we don't have already, 
      but we want some feedback.  To get the linux version click here or for the Windows 
      version click here.</P>

   <P>-=AQ:E News=-</P>

   <P>In real news, AQ:E is progressing nicely. In the 3.2 versions, we're going 
      to have more script options and some admin fucntions such as map voting.  
      Poor fex is working for a living now, I guess he has a slightly higher workload now.</P>

   <P>New Project: Low Lag Action Quake - <small>April 30th, 1999</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Here is a new item from <A HREF="mailto:hal9000@telefragged.com">Hal[9k]</A></P>

   <P>In response to a brief discussion yesterday, AQDT brings you an experimental 
      version of AQ that should reduce the nasty lag associated with huge firefights. 
      Essentially the way the weapon sounds are handled has been changed to be more 
      efficient and bandwidth-friendly. Servers just need to run the new dll. Any 
      clients that connect need to get the small client pack - it's basically the 
      normal AQ weapon sounds renamed to fit the new sound scheme and should have no 
      effect on regular AQ servers.</P>

   <P>AQDT Releases Action Quake: Espionage, code name AQ:E - <small>April 10th, 1999</small>
     <HR noshade></P>
   <P>-=Software Release=-</P>

   <P>The time is finally here! Tonight we are releasing our project 
      entitled Action Quake: Espionage (AQ:E) commonly known as CTB.</P>

   <P>AQ:E is a flexible, teamplay objective system for Action Quake. 
      With AQ:E you can create your own scenarios and or use the current scenarios 
      that we have included, CTB, ATL (Assassinate The Leader), ETV (Escort the VIP), 
      and many more.</P>

   <P>The Server and client packs are available for download on our 
      <A HREF="files.htm">files</A> page.</P>

   <P>AQDT would like to thank everyone who helped out on this project and also to 
      all the people that have been playing AQ:E on the beta servers reporting bugs 
      and offering their suggestions. Without you guys this project really wouldn't 
      mean much.</P>

   <P>-=Future Projects=-</P>

   <P>We have some other projects in the works. I am not at liberty at this time 
      to discuss them, but I will post some new news on this subject in the near future.</P>
