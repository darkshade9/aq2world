   <P>Lucy owns me - <small>November 5th, 2000</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Yes, she does, but everyone already knew that.  And if not you know now.</P>
   <P>In other news, TE 4.4 should be ready this week.  And the Reaction project is
      now hosted by AQDT for the present time, you can find it at

   <P>TE 4.4 in production - <small>October 22nd, 2000</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Yes, after a few months of our traditional slacking, we (loosely defined 
      as always) have been working on a new TE version to address stuff that's 
      come up since the last time circumstances pushed us into action.  Welcome 
      Tsunami to the growing list of people who have more or less done the work 
      I've asked/told/begged them to do while I try to do stuff.</P>

   <P>In other more or less relevant news, I start working for IBM in a week, fex 
      and homo haven't changed, Fool Killer is a working stiff these days, and hal, 
      god of coders, is working on a title that's making me want to buy an X-Box already.

   <P>Homer and Lucy had a kid, and a not so new TE version. - <small>July 29th, 2000</small>
     <HR noshade></P>
   <P>*pop*</P>

   <P>*Guinevere entered the game</P>

   <P>Guinevere Melissa Rose was born on July 22 2000, and weighed in at 7 lbs 6 
      oz of pink wrinkled human. Congrats to Homer & Lucy on the birth of their daughter.</P>

   <P>All the best to the Homer family, rest easy Lucy...</P>

   <P>In other news, people have been bugging me to get this site updated with the 
      latest TE version and since Homer is busy with a new kid I thought I'd take care 
      of it at least for now. Without further delay, here it is, version 4.3d. It's a 
      bit experimental from what I hear, but it should be fairly stable.</P>

   <P>Something's finally done! - <small>May 25th, 2000</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Alright, so I'm just a LITTLE late in this, I'm working on an MCSE and my 
      wife is very pregnant, so I've been busy, so sue me. But thanks to #aq2 
      bitching and moaning (Jazzy especially) I actually did something, namely 
      ask hal to finish what I started. Thanks to him TE won't loop forever on 
      a map vote, and snipers rejoice, the bug is apparently fixed for real. 
      I consulted a few people who shall remain nameless, but they all said 
      "No, its not that, it must be something else." Then hal looked, saw the 
      mistake and said: "That's it." I feel like a dumbass, but the credentials 
      were there so I didn't doubt them. I am REALLY tempted to rant and scream, 
      but I'm tired as hell, so I'll just say I FIGURED IT OUT A YEAR AGO!!!! 
      AND THEY TOLD ME IT MUST BE SOMETHING ELSE!!!! ARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!</P>

   <P>There, I feel better now. For everyone who plays OGL, this IS the new official 
      server binary, so get your match servers up to date. It includes AQ:E as well, 
      with all those goodies.</P>

   <P>From hal: The hybrid AQ:Espionage Tournament Edition 4.0 package is now available. 
      This merges in TE 1.21 with AQ:E 3.6 and offers the full range of both, including 
      DM, TP, Matchplay TP, Espionage scenarios, and Matchplay Espionage scenarios. 
      Set the appropriate variables to enable the desired mode (teamplay, scripts, and 
      matchplay). This includes all the new fixes that were going to go in 1.53.</P>

   <P>New TE features/fixes include the following:</P>

   <P>Fixed mapvoting bug<BR>
      * Added informative "captain" and "ready" messages<BR>
      * Fixed missed sniper shots bug<BR>
      * Fixed sniper delay bug (hopefully)</P>

   <P>New Espionage features/fixes include the following:</P>

   <P>* 'rules' command to show match parameters<BR>
      * weapon/item restriction</P>

   <P>Win9x: aqete-40-x86.zip</P>

   <P>Linux: aqete-40-i386.tar.gz</P>

   <P>And for those who are hearing hyperblasters while playing, its the 
      lowlag code from AQ:E that has been implemented. Check out details and 
      download the patch here.</P>

   <P>An Announcement - <small>January 25th, 2000</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>I haven't often been one for quiet diplomacy, so in this I will be direct. 
      Effective on the release of TE 1.21 I am retiring from the mod development scene. 
      I simply don't have the drive anymore, and my return to active playing has 
      chewed up what used to be the time I had for coding. (And my time for sleeping 
      as well). I'm not going anywhere, like many of the other retirements that 
      have taken place recently. I just want to relax and not have the next version 
      of anything hanging over my head. Thanks belong to Homo, hal, Pluton, Death Mark, 
      inghaw, fex and Chipko, you guys own, and I'll still be acting like a lamer on 
   `  IRC for a long time yet. Also thanks to the Bacon Force vets who suckered me 
      into playing again, and to my new clan FFJ, especially Nightfall and Monk, 
      who made me realize that AQ was still fun as hell. I'll be around, though 
      you won't know it until I'm bullet spamming and taunting people. :)</P>

   <P>Oh yeah, 1.21 will be done in the next week, the full test of beta1 went 
      smoothly except for a scoreboard glitch, at least until the timelimit hit 
      and the server crashed. But that'll be fixed whenever I can tear myself 
      off daboyz long enough to have an attention span.</P>

   <P>You're only young once. - <small>December 24th, 1999</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>This is just a little tribute to the man that breathed new life into our 
      dying messageboard. His selfless donation of time, effort and legal 
      software has made him a leader of the Actionquake community and someone 
      that I am proud to call my friend. Happy birthday Fex, grab a handfull 
      for the rest of us :)</P> 

   <P ALIGN="center">Happy birthday to you</P>

   <P>AQ:TE 1.3 Update (Back in the saddle again) - <small>August 8th, 1999</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Well, time to get back on track. I've been busy, really really busy. 
      (Wife, kid, job, school, you try finding time to code in there) 
      But time is slowly becoming more available/usable these days, and 
      TE 1.3 is calling me. Therefore I'll be working on it as much as 
      possible over the next while. As always, I'll take suggestions any 
      time (my new receive address is now homer@technoelite.com). 
      More updates will follow once I have a definitive todo/features list.</P>

   <P>Just as a note, the vote loop bug has been found (blame the freaky Norwegian 
      on that one). It WILL be fixed in 1.3 (if enough people whine I'll recompile 
      1.2 with a fix but that's getting a little complicated for some admins to keep 
      up with. :P</P>
