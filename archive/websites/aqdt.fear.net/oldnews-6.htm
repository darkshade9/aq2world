   <P>Website and ETE Docs updated - <small>March 23rd, 2002</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>This is in anticipation of the release of 4.6a.  Not yet, but soon.  Soon.</P>

   <P>4.6a in testing - <small>March 23rd, 2002</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>4.6a is in testing now.  Some Espionage and Arena tweaks, new command for server ops, and 
      some other fun stuff.  Updated the version history in the ETE Docs section with specifics.</P>

   <P>Server move complete! - <small>March 22nd, 2002</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Looks like the subdomain is working on the new IP.  The site should be stable now.</P>
   <P ALIGN="right">- <A HREF="mailto:superproz@aol.com">Black Monk</A></P>

   <P>Server being moved... - <small>March 17th, 2002</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>This server is going to be moved and a new IP assigned sometime soon.  The new IP will
      be 207.54.65.108 so until the DNS updates you might have to use the IP to get to this
      site.  I think the link you'd want would be:</P>
   <P><A HREF="http://207.54.65.108/aqdt/main2.html">http://207.54.65.108/aqdt/main2.html</A></P>
   <P>Since the server is going to be in a state of flux for this upcoming week, we are going
      to probably hold off releasing ETE 4.6 until next week and throw in a few more tweaks
      in the meantime.  We're ready to release at this very moment but... eh, one more week 
      shouldn't hurt and we'll have the server hopefully steadied out by then.  Sorry for the 
      delay, eh, I know some people are really looking forward to this release--trust me, it will
      be worth it!</P>

   <P>4.5j in testing - <small>March 14th, 2002</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>4.5j is in testing now.  Maplist and map rotation handling now greatly improved due 
      to the work of the genius coder, Hal9000.  Updated the version history in the ETE

   <P>4.5i in testing - <small>March 10th, 2002</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>4.5i is in testing now.  Espionage spawning tweaked, minor bugfix for damage during 
      end of round FF, added some functionality to "rcon map" so you can sometimes pick up
      where you left off in the map rotation when you changed the map.  Only works in some 
      conditions.  Updated the version history in the ETE Docs section with specifics.</P>

   <P>Where to install? - <small>February 24th, 2002</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>The question came up recently as to where to install AQDT files?  If you
      look inside the ZIP files you will see that they assume "action" as the 
      main folder.  This means that unless you want \quake2\action\action\players
      for instance, you should extract the files into "quake2" not "action" as 
      some people have apparently been doing.  In WinZIP you can check the stored
      directories and paths for all the files to the right of the files.</P>
   <P>AQMD ZIPs extract direct into "action".  AQDT ZIPs extract direct into "quake2".</P>

      person too.  AQ:Arena has been integrated as an additional gameplay mode.
      "scenarios" has been "fixed" to prevent overflowing and "menu" now aliases to
      "settings" for matches (TE and ETE modes).  Espionage has been tweaked a bit.

   <P>How to install the ETE Support Pack? - <small>February 14th, 2002</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>pics\bcase_i.pcx not found?  If you got the ETE Support Pack and still have this problem...</P>
   <P>RENAME THE "pakN.pak" FILE TO SOMETHING LIKE "pak9.pak"!</P>
   <P>If you don't know how to do this, then get the "Easy ETE Support Pack" which
      is just a ZIP file, no PAK files.  While some people like the organizational 
      properties of PAK files and stuff, other people never read instructions or 
      don't notice that the PAK file is named something else.  So... if there's a 
      problem, just get someone to use the "Easy" file to install from.  Yay!</P>
   <P>If the briefcases look RED when someone picks them up but normal otherwise, you need to
      get a small update.  For any new players, the ETE Support Pack and Easy ETE Support Pack
      have both already been fixed so you can disregard this:</P>
   <P><a href="https://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/aqdt.fear.net/aqe/ete-redcasefix.zip">ete-redcasefix.zip</A> (30 KB)</P>
   <P>A list of skins used by the most common scenarios can be found here:</P>
   <P><A HREF="aqdtdocs/script4.htm">Skins used in most Espionage scenarios</A></P>
   <P>All the skins are in the ETE Support Packs so you shouldn't have to worry about 'em.
      Lemme know which ones you're missing if you are missing any after getting the Packs.</P>

   <P>Reminder of 4.4a ETE features - <small>February 14th, 2002</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>For those who had OLD copies of Espionage 3.3a/3.3/3.2, you need new packages.
      I checked the old scenarios to make sure they are all "fixed" and proper.  
      The old ones had some minor errors that only manifested themselves in later 
      versions of ETE.  Oddly enough, I guess ETE got more strict in the scenario 
      parsing so the old errors that didn't matter before suddenly mattered.</P>
   <P>Also, some of the models were tweaked so you'll need to update them as well.<P>
   <P>Some of the new features of ETE 4.4a:</P>
   <UL>
   <LI>Deathmatch spawn protection--helps eliminate spawn camping
   <LI>Enhanced Referee function for TE and ETE modes
   <LI>TE mode can work with Teamplay AND Espionage modes now, nicely too
   <LI>Some various "rcon sv" commands that are of use
   <LI>Lowlag sounds can be disabled (why would you want to?)
   <LI>Some new % commands, %%, %K, %D
   <LI>Anti-name impersonation safeguard
   <LI>End of round FF, shoot and kick your teammates!<BR>
      (idea from Gamblor or JBravo, I forget) 
   <LI>Other random stuff y'all don't care about.  :)
   </UL>

   <P>4.4c in testing - <small>February 14th, 2002</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>4.4c is in testing now.  The "ignore" command has been improved as well as
      "ignoreid".  You use the id's you get from typing in "skins" in console.
      You can now ignore more than one person, too.  Just keep ignoring extra people
      and all of them are kept track of.  Some other tweaks being looked into, too.</P>

   <P>Request for ML locations - <small>February 14th, 2002</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>If anyone is interested in making ML location files, please let me know.
      This would benefit AQ:ETE, AQ:TNG, and also AQ:ML since they all use the same format now.
      You must use the AQ:ML server binary to create the location files, but both ETE and
      TNG can use the resulting files.  :)  Look in the "howto" section on the ML site for a
      tutorial on making ML files.  It even has pictures, eh, what more could you want?!?</P>
   <P>AQ:ML -

   <P>Espionage server setup - <small>February 14th, 2002</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>There's not much to do.  All the default .cfg files are premade and in place.
      Just "exec" the espserver.cfg file and BOOM you have an Espionage server.  You 
      can turn Espionage on and off with "rcon scripts 1" or "rcon scripts 0" and by 
      changing a map.  You need to manually change a map to turn Espionage on or off 
      while the server is running or in-game, the cvar is latched.</P>
