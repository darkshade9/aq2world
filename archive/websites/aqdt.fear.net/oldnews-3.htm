   <P>AQ: TE 1.2a Release - <small>August 8th, 1999</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>UPDATE: WINDOWS VERSION NOW AVAILABLE:</P>

   <P>After some LONG delays, AQ:TE 1.2a is finally here in Linux format. Get it at:</P>

   <P>Features are fully documented and are also available online by clicking the 
     "TE" button above.</P>

   <P>Windows binary will be available soon. Please note that there is an issue with 
      the current release where the server still falls into an infinite loop sometimes 
      while waiting for the vote for the next map. Another version is planned very soon. 
      But given some unavoidable delays, I felt the current code was stable enough to 
      release for use in matches.</P>

   <P>AQ: TE Update - <small>July 24th, 1999</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Alright. Here goes.</P>

   <P>First: The port to 1.52 will be done soon, as well as other improvements 
      to the original TE and bugfixes. Expect a week or two.</P>

   <P>Second: We're looking into the 2 major issues identified so far: a bug where 
      the server waits repeatedly for a map vote (cause: ?), as well as an "issue" 
      reported where the game "misses" a +attack.</P>

   <P>Work is progressing at an OK rate. Expect lots of improved features in the 
      next release, including more settings menu options.</P>

   <P>AQ: Espionage v3.3 - <small>July 11th, 1999</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Update: quick bug fix in the server - download 3.3a</P>

   <P>AQDT proudly presents AQ:Espionage v3.3. This version of our scripted 
      teamplay mod for Action Quake sports a number of bug fixes new scenarios, 
      and new features, including the following:</P>

   <UL>
   <LI>Server comands for scenario selection
   <LI>Gibbing for handcannon and sniper headshots
   <LI>Map voting
   <LI>Custom weapon loadouts
   <LI>Periodic respawns
   <LI>Capture-and-Hold objective
   <LI>"Clue" feature for special players
   <LI>Optimized weapon sounds
   <LI>Nifty scoreboard
   <LI>Support for different flavors of CTF entities
   <LI>Location information in chat messages
   </UL>

   <P>Select the appropriate file from below and unzip/untar it into your quake2 
      directory. Dedicated servers need only get the server file for their OS. 
      Client operators need only get the client file, unless you want to be able 
      to run a server as well. If you've already downloaded the client files for 
      AQ:E 3.2, then just grab the upgrade files. Included in the new client is a 
      file called pakN.pak, which should be renamed to an unused filename in the 
      range pak0.pak-pak9.pak.</P>

   <P>AQ: Tournament Edition 1.0-RELEASE - <small>June 15th, 1999</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>-- 3:54 PM UPDATE: WIN32 VERSION NOW AVAILABLE</P>

   <P>Sorry for the delay.</P>

   <P>-- 2:09 AM UPDATE : ERRATA : IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT --</P>

   <P>I've become aware of a slight bug in the distribution (not reported, but in 
      the course of a bug audit). It's slight and non-fatal, but annoying to say 
      the least. I've already responded and fixed the bug. Please re-download the 
      file from the link below if you have already downloaded AQ:TE. Sorry for the 
      inconvenience. The Windows veresion should contain the bugfix when released.</P>

   <P>-- END ERRATA --</P>

   <P>Wow, a flurry of updates recently. Well, I am once again here to update you 
      on the AQ:TE status (I hope this doesn't become a habit, heh heh). The AQDT team 
      is proud to bring you, in conjunction with the AQ:G team, the 1.0-RELEASE of 
      Action Quake: Tournament Edition. Sporting full-fledged features that every 
      tournament edition of any mod should have, AQ:TE is sure to make the clanmatch 
      world a heck of a lot easier. Unfortunately, due to an unfortunate mishap, the 
      only binary currently available for download is the Linux binary. The Windows binary 
      will be available for download in the morning. You can grab it at the following 
      download location:</P>

   <P>As usual, report any problems to <A HREF="mailto:inghaw@fear.net">inghaw@fear.net</A> 
      or <A HREF="mailto:homer@fear.net">homer@fear.net</A> as soon as possible. 
      A shout out to all those who made this possible, including all those 
      who took the time to beta-test the scoreboard (my piece of code) and show how 
      incompetent I really am.</P>

   <P>One last thing. AQ:TE will be the only AQDT mod not sporting the low-lag feature 
      that Hal introduced a while ago. This was a decision made in part to prevent 
      clients from having to download extra stuff. So, to reiterate, no client downloads 
      are necessary for TE.</P>

   <P>You can read the online documentation here.</P>

   <P>-= Other AQDT News=-</P>

   <P>Action Quake: Arena: Coming along very well. Apparently a lot of the architecture 
      is already in AQ, so most of the work is in the structure of the gameplay.</P>

   <P>Action Quake: Espionage: Coming along great. I don't know too much about this end 
      of the AQDT project line, but Hal says it's coming along great, and I believe Hal, 
      because everybody should.</P>

   <P>Low Lag Action Quake: Yes.</P>

   <P>On another note, work is proceeding on a monster, unified binary (dll/.so) that 
      will contain all the AQDT modifications and allow server ops to switch mods on a 
      whim by changing a cvar, rather than having to swap back and forth between different 
      dll's or .so's.</P>

   <P>That's it for now.</P>

   <P>LowLag Sounds - <small>June 14th, 1999</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Apparently there is some confusion as to how to handle the sounds 
      when the LowLag stuff is running. First, unzip the client pack into 
      your quake2/action directory. The sounds will be automatically deposited 
      into the appropriate subdirs from there.</P>

   <P>Second, if you want to use custom sounds, then you need to name the sound 
      files as follows under your action directory:</P>

   <P><A HREF="lowlag.htm">Lowlag Sound Naming Scheme</A></P>

   <P>This pretty much screws people who have sounds in .pak files, but not much 
      can be done other than reconstructing the .pak file with the appropriate 
      directory and file names. Maybe we can get Fireblade to incorporate this 
      as "official" sometime.</P>

   <P>AQ: Arena - Beta Release ( 0.00000001 ) - <small>June 12th, 1999</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>AQ: Arena is in its infant test stages. Hopefully we will have a stable test 
      version out soon. In the meantime, hop on #actionquake2 and we might be running 
      a test of it. On a side note, if you find yourself on a server running one of 
      AQDT's packages (AQ:Espionage, AQ:Tournament Edition, AQ:Arena) and the sounds 
      seem to be from regular Quake2, try installing the 
      <A HREF="https://files.aq2world.com/telefragged/freelance/aqdt/lowlag-client.zip">
      LowLag Client Pack</A>. It's most likely that the server is running our sound 
      bandwidth optimization, which requires the weapon sounds to be renamed to those 
      from baseq2.</P>

   <P>AQ: Tournament Edition - Beta Release ( 0.92 ) - <small>June 10th, 1999</small><HR noshade></P>
   <P>Homer's not around right now, so apparently I am doing the update. 
      AQDT proudly brings you the first fully supported beta of Action Quake: 
      Tournament Edition. You can get them from the following links:</P>

   <P>Please report any problems to <A HREF="mailto:inghaw@fear.net">inghaw@fear.net</A> or 
      <A HREF="mailto:homer@fear.net">homer@fear.net</A> as soon as possible. 
      This version is distinct from the previous releases in that this is a near-release 
      beta, in that aside from bugfixes, there will be very few additional features added 
      unless it becomes apparent that one is needed. So please help us beta-test 
      this through and through, as always, we'd like to crunch out the final 
      release with as few bugs as possible.</P>

   <P>-= Other AQDT News=-</P>

   <P>There has been suggestions of a RA2 sort of variant for AQ2, 
      "Action Quake: Arena." This is being discussed, and looks likely. 
      As of now, however, AQ:TE and AQ:E are still the top priorities.</P>

   <P>Since I've sort of deleted the previous news posts way down there, here 
      are the important news from AQDT you should also know:</P>

   <P>Action Quake: Espionage, the flagship AQDT project, is available for 
      download from the files page. Please be sure to read the documentation 
      and grab the client files. Scenario submissions please to 
      aqdtscn@fear.net, keep 'em coming.</P>

   <P>Low Lag Action Quake, brought to you by Hal[9k], available for download 
      from the following links:</P>
