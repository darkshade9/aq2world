  Espionage, Features</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Espionage is a goals-oriented 
  variant of Action Quake. The goals for each map are determined by scenarios, 
  files that are loaded by the server to tell each team what they have to do. 
  For more information on scenario scripting, please download the server-side 
  pak and read the development documentation on Hal9000's own custom scripting 
  language. In any case, when you join a scenario in progress, the goals are printed 
  across the top of your client hud. Whichever team accomplishes their goal first 
  wins.</font></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font face="Verdana" size="-1">There are a wide range 
  of goals--the most popular and well known is &quot;Capture the Briefcase.&quot; 
  Each team must get the other team's briefcase and bring it back to their own 
  base, with their own briefcase there. Pretty straightforward. There is also 
  &quot;Assassinate the Leader,&quot; where a person from each team is randomly 
  selected to be that team's &quot;leader,&quot; and that team must protect their 
  leader while assassinating the other team's. &quot;Find, Retrieve and Defend&quot; 
  is the scenario where a randomly selected player on one team is chosen to pickup 
  a package from a fixed location, and deposit it at another fixed location. His 
  team is assigned to escort him, while the other team must assassinate the carrier. 
  &quot;Escort the VIP&quot; is where a randomly selected player on one team is 
  chosen to be escorted to a fixed location to win. The enemy team must assassinate 
  that randomly selected player. Finally, &quot;One Flag Capture&quot; is where 
  two teams battle it out for a single package to bring to their base. The package 
  is spawned in a neutral location.</font></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Keep in mind these 
  are scenario types. More likely, you'll see some &quot;Drug Run&quot; scenario 
  or some other &quot;cool name.&quot; The scenario scripting options allow a 
  large number of combination of goals and what not. Also remember that AQ:E is 
  continually being worked on. The next version will include support for many 
  more scenario scripting options.</font></b></font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="-1" color="#FFFFFF">Various features include 
  Hal's own bugfixes to 1.51 and also the &quot;door kicking&quot; anti-camper 
  measure. Kicking a door now opens it, regardless of if there is somebody behind 
  it holding it shut. Various other features make Action Quake: Espionage an entirely 
  new experience with both additions and improvements from the original Action 
  Quake 2.</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font face="Verdana" size="-1">&quot;goals&quot; - 
  the &quot;goals&quot; command redisplays the current objectives for both teams 
  on your hud.</font></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font face="Verdana" size="-1">&quot;ignore [playername]&quot; 
  - the ignore command lets you ignore messages from a particular player.</font></b></font></p>

  - selfexplanatory.</font></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font face="Verdana" size="-1" color="#FFFF00"><font face="Verdana"><a name="clientpak"></a></font><font size="+2">The 
  Clientpak</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font face="Verdana" size="-1">First you must <a href="files.html">download 
  the client pack</a> from the AQDT page. Installation is straightforward-- unzip 
  it.</font></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Included in the clientpak 
  are various vweps and sounds. You will notice that the person who is carrying 
  the briefcase or package in a scenario actually looks like he is carrying a 
  briefcase, courtesy of vwep.</font></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font face="Verdana" size="-1">New radio sounds are 
  included with Espionage. The new sounds are used exactly as the sounds with 
  which you are familiar:<br>
  </font></b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font face="Verdana" size="-1">radio &lt;filename-without-wav-extension&gt;</font></b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font face="Verdana" size="-1">So for example, &quot;radio 
  plost2&quot; broadcasts, &quot;Package Lost!&quot; across the radio. Use these 
  in your config.cfg bindings. Note that there are both female and male sounds.</font></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font face="Verdana" size="-1" color="#FF0000"><font face="Verdana"><a name="playing"></a></font><font color="#FFFF00" size="+2">Playing 
  the Game</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cooperate with your 
  team to achieve your team's goals. Every frag you make related in some way to 
  a goal (e.g., defending your package, killing the enemy leader, etc.) earns 
  you a fixed frag bonus. Every un-related frag (i.e., killing an enemy far from 
  anything important) earns you 0.25 frags. Additionally, a capture in CTB gives 
  everybody on that team a small frag bonus. This is to encourage team-oriented 
  play.</font></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font face="Verdana" size="-1">If you die, you respawn 
  according to how the scenario says you respawn. Some scenarios dictate you respawn 
  after a certain amount of time (e.g., 15 seconds), others dictate you respawn 
  after a certain percentage of your team dies, others dictate you respawn immediately. 
  Note that you can talk to the living while dead. </font></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font face="Verdana" size="-1">In order to &quot;pick 
  up&quot; a package or briefcase, you must be holding either your Mk23 pistol 
  or a knife. This makes sense-- most people don't run around with a sniper rifle 
  in one arm, and large briefcase in the other. If you drop the package, it returns 
  to the appropriate base according to how the scenario dictates. Most CTB scenarios 
  dictate that touching the package will make it return. Some CTB scenarios dictate 
  that you need to prevent the other team from touching the package for a certain 
  amount of time for it to return. Some CTB scenarios may not even require that 
  you return your own briefcase to capture the enemy's.</font></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Note also that stealth 
  slippers are now beefed up. User doesn't receive the &quot;limp mode&quot; walk 
  when they get shot in the leg. User also gets less falling dammage and can fall 
  down farther.</font></b></font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="-1" color="#FFFFFF">Above all, help your team 
  achieve their goals!</font></b></p>
