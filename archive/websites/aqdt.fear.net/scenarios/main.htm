        This place is pretty much dead unless anyone has interest in making new 
        scenarios and whatnot.  The files and information here should be useful, 
        though, and a worthwhile resource.  Please check the site out!  The 
        email addresses probably won't work, so don't bother.  Um, I guess I'll 
        see about working something out.  Until then, send any Espionage/Scenario 
        email/questions to superproz@aol.com -- my email account.  Please have the 
        subject be "Scenario Depot" so I can spot your email amongst the daily spam.

        about the complete lack of news. First, I've been slack, work on TE and 
        Real Life (tm) has been kicking my butt. But second, I'm sad to say that 
        there's actually only been 1 scenario submission this whole time, from 
        &quot;Sauce&quot;, and definitely looks cool. A combo OFC and ETV scenario-- 
        not tested, but I encourage everybody to try it out and give him feedback. 
        You can get it now at the Scenarios section.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">In 
        other news, exciting stuff is happening on the AQ:E front. Hal is planning 
        a new release sometime soon with some brand new scenario types, among 
        other cool things. Be on the lookout for those.</font></p>
