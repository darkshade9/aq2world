AQDT Scenario Depot Script Information

Scenario Name: dirtrace
Author: inghaw
E-Mail Contact: inghaw@fear.net

General Description (what type of game, what map [if any], etc...):

The package is in the middle.  Both teams start in their fort and race
to put it in the target area in the opposite fort.  The team who does it
first wins (kills off the other team).

Note that this is a non-CONTINUOUS scenario, and that you spawn in the area
*opposite* the area you want to bring the package to, so that these are
significant differences, significant enough to call it something
other than OFC, in my opinion.  Anyways, the whole objective is to do
whatever it takes to put the flag in the other team's base.

Ever play the map "Push" in TCFC?  It's kinda like that, except instead of
the football (erm soccer ball), you have a package.

Objectives: Explained above


Respawn Rule: INSTANT
