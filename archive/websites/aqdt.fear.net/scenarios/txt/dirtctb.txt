AQDT Scenario Depot Script Information

Scenario Name: dirtctb

E-Mail Contact: inghaw@fear.net

General Description (what type of game, what map [if any], etc...):

Ass Kickers vs. Bitch Slappers
A match of pure firepower to be played on dirt.
Each team respawns instantly and must move their flag (a small distance)
from the enemy base back to their base, where they can cap only if their
flag is at home.  While this may seem impossible on a small map like
dirt, the catch is that the packages don't return on touch; you have to
protect them on the field for 20 full seconds before they return.

This can lead to fun defensive stands.  Maybe hard to capture, but fun. :)

Objectives: Explained above

Respawn Rule: INSTANT
Other Notes: THIS IS IMPORTANT
Although the script specifies that the packages should return in 20 seconds,
until a slight omission is fixed in the next release, it will only return
in 30.  I realize that this makes it harder to capture, much harder, but
think of it as a defensive challenge.  :)
