AQDT Scenario Depot Script Information

Scenario Name: Capture the Briefcase TF Rules Variant 
Author: inghaw
E-Mail Contact: inghaw@fear.net

General Description (what type of game, what map [if any], etc...):

Standard CTB for maps *with flag spawns* (e.g., ctbcity, blockwar), but
the catch is that the flags don't touch return.  You have to protect them on
the field for 25 seconds for them to return.  The flip side of the coin is that
your own flag need not be at home for you to capture.  This can lead to
some interesting, different defensive/offensive strategies than your
average game of CTB.

Objectives: Explained above.

Respawn Rule: TIME 15
Other Notes:
IMPORTANT: Although the script specifies that your package should return
after 25 seconds, until a small glitch is corrected in AQ:E, it will only
return after 30.  But since your own flag need not be home to capture (unlike
dirtctb, where it does), this shouldn't make too much of a difference.
