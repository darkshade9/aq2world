<p><font color="#009900" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>PREFACE</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the 
  creation of AQ:E has come an unprecedented amount of flexibility. Thanks to 
  Hal's amazing scripting language, one game of Capture the Briefcase could be 
  as fresh, innovative, and different from another game. While this is great, 
  it can create some confusion amongst clanleaders, when trying to negotiate certain 
  settings. This has given rise to the need of &quot;standard scripts&quot; and 
  settings that are pre-fabricated with the specific intention of creating the 
  most dynamic, strategic, and fun clanmatch. Emphasized in these scripts and 
  settings are fairness in spawnpoints (thus the need for standard flagspawns--please 
  use the scripts we provide--this is talked about below), and a fairness in the 
  different types of respawn rules. Keep in mind that this not any type of official 
  document, it was written by a regular schmoe, me. Nothing listed below is an 
  officially endorsed recommendation of AQDT, nor are we the Scenario Depot. I 
  have, however, in the course of developing this, consulted various sources. 
  Many thanks to Hal, fex, Imrik, Homosaurus, Homer, Deathmark, Satan (GF, not 
  the real devil =] ), pot-shot, Mm2000, LtHawkins, and others who have offered 
  productive advice.</font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This document 
  is meant as an explanation of why things in the scripts we provide are the way 
  they are.</font></p>

    Number of Players</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, any 
  clanmatch needs to be at least some decent size, and while the general acceptance 
  of a 4v4 minimum for regular teamplay can easily be fitted to a CTB game, keep 
  in mind that generally, CTB games should be larger than regular teamplay games. 
  The reasoning is simply that there are more roles for people to play; it's hard 
  to have a strategy if more people die (and thus more randomness is created), 
  and it's all around more chaotic. More is generally better, even though we have 
  to make concessions to server limitations.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recommendation: 
  5v5, minimum</font></p>

  <p><font color="#00CCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Roundlimit</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Use of the 
  CONTINUOUS variable means that gameplay is non-stop. And although testers agree 
  that the captures can rack up pretty quickly in public games, they don't do 
  so in clanmatches. It's much harder to capture. In the first ever scrim on teamjungle, 
  a game to 15 round lasted 90 minutes.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recommendation: 
  8 rounds</font></p>

  <p><font color="#00CCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>dmflags</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The standard 
  settings should suffice. SPAWNFARTHEST is recommended to be kept ON. This makes 
  your group respawn farthest away from someone when they kill you. Avoids massive 
  &quot;respawn wars&quot; that prevent teams from regrouping.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having everybody 
  die when someone captures the flag not only interrupts the flow of the gameplay, 
  but cuts out a whole element of strategy (instead of consistently holding your 
  base, you want to kill their guy who has the package while you remain alive...more 
  akin to ATL). The general feeling is that the entire game should be kept continuous.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recommendation: 
  CONTINUOUS</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font color="#00CCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>TARGET_AREA</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concerning 
  maps without CTF spawn points, there are will be a standard set of coordinates 
  for the different flagspawns on maps. These can be found in each map's respective 
  script file on this site, and should not be altered. For instance, the flagspawns 
  on teamjungle should be the same across all clanmatches. This is to prevent 
  completely biased, unfair, or otherwise out-of-whack real matches from going 
  down. The bounding box for TARGET_AREA should be the standard 30x30x30, with 
  the blaster markers marking them off with a dmspawnpoint model in their place, 
  regardless of whether or not the map came with included CTF spawnpoints.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recommendation: 
  Use the script files provided to keep 30x30x30 flagspawns in the standard positions.</font></p>

<p><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The model 
  used should be the two briefcase models provided by AQDT. VWEP should always 
  be on; GLOW or FOLLOW should not be enabled.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is 
  where the issue for clanmatches gets sticky. The option of INSTANT is ruled 
  out, for clear reasons. FRACTION [TOGETHER] and TIME both have their advantages. 
  With FRACTION TOGETHER, you spawn in groups, which would make things much easier 
  to coordinate roles, and would lead to fun and interesting pushes into and out 
  of enemy territories. However, this creates the propensity for players to control 
  the respawn rate of their teammates; a simple &quot;kill&quot; command or a 
  jump off a building could be a huge strategic boost to a team by reviving their 
  members. This is more than just a frivolous objection; killing yourself to revive 
  the team is not something that is part of the Action Quake theme (as some have 
  pointed out, there is a difference between dying to save the team, and dying 
  to revive them). With the dead able to talk to the alive, this becomes a tangible 
  problem. Another problem is people killing themselves if out of ammo, since 
  the &quot;dead time&quot; can be short. While some say this would not occur 
  in clanmatches, others have said that clanmatches will only fuel the perfection 
  of this strategy of methodical suicide. TIME, while avoiding this problem, is 
  only marginally better, since it prevents people from respawning together, and 
  eliminates a chunk of the respawning teamwork. However, until there is a plausible 
  fix for this problem, the drawbacks of exploiting the FRACTION respawn seem 
  to out-balance (be worse than) the drawbacks of not spawning together. After 
  all, a well-coordinated team should be able to regroup their players relatively 
  quickly. TIME also affords the strategic possibility of being able to entirely 
  kill of the other team, something which should be rewarded, instead of having 
  a static number of players on the field at the same time.</font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On another 
  issue, the enemy should not be able to respawn inside your base. This creates 
  too much of an element of luck, rather than strategic pushes into bases. AWAY_FROM 
  should be kept on.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recommendation: 
  TIME 15 AWAY_FROM [enemy base] 1</font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a side-note, 
  Hal and Imrik had some good suggestions for better remedies. PERIODIC is a possibility, 
  with everybody respawning every 30 seconds, regardless of how long you have 
  been dead. Everybody would spawn together, creating more teamwork, and there 
  are no possibilities to exploit respawning. Imrik had probably the best suggestion, 
  which I'll just call option IMRIK here. You would have to wait 10 seconds before 
  the fraction respawn includes you, and if no one else dies, you respawn in 30 
  seconds. (Times could vary. Whatever. The principle is really good.) Hopefully 
  we will see this in an upcoming AQ:E update. Until then, TIME will have to suffice.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The agreement 
  here seems to be that standard CTF rules should be adopted, rather than something 
  like Team Fortress. Your flag should return on touch, and your flag should be 
  at home, rather than TF capture rules, where your flag does not return on touch 
  (it returns after a set amount of time), and where your flag does not need to 
  be at home to capture.</font></p>
