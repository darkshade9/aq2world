<p>*Guinevere entered the game</p>

<p>Guinevere Melissa Rose was born on July 22 2000, and weighed in at 7 lbs 6 oz of pink wrinkled human. Congrats to Homer & Lucy on the birth of their daughter.
 </p>

<p>All the best to the Homer family, rest easy Lucy...</p>

<p> In other news, people have been bugging me to get this site updated with the latest TE version and since Homer is busy with a new kid I thought I'd take care of it at least for now.  Without further delay, here it is, version 4.3d.  It's a bit experimental from what I hear, but it should be fairly stable.

      <P><FONT face=Verdana size=-1><B>Alright, so I'm just a LITTLE late in 
      this, I'm working on an MCSE and my wife is very pregnant, so I've been 
      busy, so sue me. But thanks to #aq2 bitching and moaning (Jazzy 
      especially) I actually did something, namely ask hal to finish what I 
      started. Thanks to him TE won't loop forever on a map vote, and snipers 
      rejoice, the bug is apparently fixed for real. I consulted a few people 
      who shall remain nameless, but they all said "No, its not that, it must be 
      something else." Then hal looked, saw the mistake and said: "That's it." I 
      feel like a dumbass, but the credentials were there so I didn't doubt 
      them. I am REALLY tempted to rant and scream, but I'm tired as hell, so 
      I'll just say I FIGURED IT OUT A YEAR AGO!!!! AND THEY TOLD ME IT MUST BE 
      SOMETHING ELSE!!!! ARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!</P>
      <P>There, I feel better now. For everyone who plays OGL, this IS the new 
      official server binary, so get your match servers up to date. It includes 
      AQ:E as well, with all those goodies. </P>
      <P>From hal: The hybrid AQ:Espionage Tournament Edition 4.0 package is now 
      available. This merges in TE 1.21 with AQ:E 3.6 and offers the full range 
      of both, including DM, TP, Matchplay TP, Espionage scenarios, and 
      Matchplay Espionage scenarios. Set the appropriate variables to enable the 
      desired mode (teamplay, scripts, and matchplay). This includes all the new 
      fixes that were going to go in 1.53.</P>
      <P>New TE features/fixes include the following:</P>
      <P>Fixed mapvoting bug<BR>* Added informative "captain" and "ready" 
      messages<BR>* Fixed missed sniper shots bug<BR>* Fixed sniper delay bug 
      (hopefully)<BR><BR>New Espionage features/fixes include the 
      following:<BR><BR>* 'rules' command to show match parameters<BR>* 
      weapon/item restriction<BR></P>

      <P>And for those who are hearing hyperblasters while playing, its the 
      lowlag code from AQ:E that has been implemented. Check out details and

      <P><FONT face=Verdana size=-1><B>I haven't often been one for quiet 
      diplomacy, so in this I will be direct. Effective on the release of TE 
      1.21 I am retiring from the mod development scene. I simply don't have the 
      drive anymore, and my return to active playing has chewed up what used to 
      be the time I had for coding. (And my time for sleeping as well). I'm not 
      going anywhere, like many of the other retirements that have taken place 
      recently. I just want to relax and not have the next version of anything 
      hanging over my head. Thanks belong to Homo, hal, Pluton, Death Mark, 
      inghaw, fex and Chipko, you guys own, and I'll still be acting like a 
      lamer on IRC for a long time yet. Also thanks to the Bacon Force vets who 
      suckered me into playing again, and to my new clan <A 
      href="http://www.ffjustice.com/">FFJ</A>, especially Nightfall and Monk, 
      who made me realize that AQ was still fun as hell. I'll be around, though 
      you won't know it until I'm bullet spamming and taunting people. :) 
      <P>Oh yeah, 1.21 will be done in the next week, the full test of beta1 
      went smoothly except for a scoreboard glitch, at least until the timelimit 
      hit and the server crashed. But that'll be fixed whenever I can tear 
      myself off daboyz long enough to have an attention span.

      <P><FONT face=Verdana size=-1><B>Well, time to get back on track. I've 
      been busy, really really busy. (Wife, kid, job, school, you try finding 
      time to code in there) But time is slowly becoming more available/usable 
      these days, and TE 1.3 is calling me. Therefore I'll be working on it as 
      much as possible over the next while. As always, I'll take suggestions any 
      time (my new receive address is now <A 
      href="http://aqdt.fear.net/homer@technoelite.com">homer@technoelite.com</A>. 
      More updates will follow once I have a definitive todo/features list.</P>
      <P>Just as a note, the vote loop bug has been found (blame the freaky 
      Norwegian on that one). It WILL be fixed in 1.3 (if enough people whine 
      I'll recompile 1.2 with a fix but that's getting a little complicated for 
      some admins to keep up with. :P </FONT></B></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR>
