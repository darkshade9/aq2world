                    format will be a single-map elimination. Whoever wins 15 rounds 
                    first wins the match. The map to be played depends on where 
                    you are in the tournament. For example, all first-round tournament 
                    matches would be played on urban, all second-round tournament 
                    matches would be played on kumanru (these are just hypothetical 
                    examples. The map schedule will be released with the brackets.).</font></p>

                    a suitable server is the responsibility of the parties involved, 
                    unless the administrator already tells you that he has prepared 
                    a server (e.g., for the championship match). The match will 
                    be played on a server that both teams agree to. If you cannot 
                    agree to a server, have <i>both teams</i> contact me with 
                    preferable times and time zones, and I will arrange a server 
                    for you to play on. However, I can be only so accomodating. 
                    Matches simply must be played. Therefore, if you play on a 
                    tournament-provided server, that match is automatically legal, 
                    barring exceptional circumstances, such as the other team 
                    confessing that they cheated, or repeated overflows or disconnects. 
                    The recommended tournament mod is Action Quake: Tournament 
                    Edition, by the AQDT. <b>However, it is not required.</b> 
                    You may play on 1.51 servers-- however, I cannot guarantee 
                    you that the other team will not be using unlimited chasecam 
                    to their advantage.</font></p>

                    Europeans out there, but it just has to be this way. Additionally, 
                    you must be accomodating towards the Eastern Time Zone.</font></p>

                    demos, if it doesn't lag the game too much.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana" size="-1" color="#000000">5.) Matches 
                    must be played by their deadline. Scheduling matches is the 
                    responsibility of the parties involved. If there is a dispute, 
                    the tournament administrator will force-schedule a match at 
                    a time he believes is accomodating for both teams. If you 
                    do not show up for the force-scheduled match, you will receive 
                    a loss. If you are unable to contact the other team, notify 
                    me, and I will attempt to contact them for you. If the other 
                    team does not respond by the deadline, they receive a loss.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana" size="-1" color="#000000">6.) Rules 
                    against camping:</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana" size="-1" color="#000000">Camping is 
                    the act of using of a chokepoint unfairly to your advantage 
                    by staying in a vantage point that affords you an opportunity 
                    to shoot without the enemy having a fair chance to shoot back. 
                    Holding a defensive position is not camping. Fleeing from 
                    a pursuer and leading him into a trap is not camping, even 
                    if the trap is setup in a chokepoint. Camping is forbidden. 
                    The tournament administrator reserves the right to make full 
                    judgement on what is and what is not camping in any given 
                    case based on evidence presented. In lieu of sufficient evidence, 
                    rulings will come down in favor of the accused. The administrator 
                    recognizes that certain maps have blatantly &quot;campable&quot; 
                    positions. Upon review of the maplisting the administrator 
                    has decided to make the use of the following areas on the 
                    following maps illegal:<br>
                    </font><font face="Verdana" size="-1" color="#000000"><br>
                    <b>actcity2</b>: the &quot;secret&quot; room (one with the 
                    kick-able entrance), as well as the bottom of the elevator 
                    shaft in the casino, as well as the high ledge where a spawn 
                    point is located (the area with a clear vantage point of the 
                    intersection, and where you must fall down on top of boxes 
                    in order to come down without taking damage.) If you spawn 
                    in this area, <b>you must come down.</b></font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana" size="-1" color="#000000">Additionally, 
                    the following areas strictly fall <b>outside the definition 
                    of camping</b>, as determined by the administrator:</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana" size="-1" color="#000000"><b>urban</b>: 
                    The roof of the highest building<br>

                  <p><font face="Verdana" size="-1" color="#000000">Please do 
                    not file a complaint about any party using those areas to 
                    their advantage. If you feel you have a legitimate complaint 
                    that a party is using a position on a map to their advantage 
                    such that you have no chance of winning, I recommend two things: 
                    a.) you get to the position first, or b.) if you feel that 
                    <i>it really is totally unfair</i>, file a complaint.<br>
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana" size="-1" color="#000000">All championship 
                    rounds will have an official representative from the tournament 
                    present to warn participants to move along, so no need to 
                    worry about those. It is recommended that you record a demo 
                    of the match or take screenshots if you plan to file a complaint 
                    about camping.</font></p>

                    decides to chasecam through your eyes and gets a demo of you 
                    using it, you're out of the tournament. Period. So don't use
