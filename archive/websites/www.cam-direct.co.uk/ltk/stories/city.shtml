                        <p><font color="#999999">It was a cold and lonely day 
                          in the city, the lone marines SSG sniper rifle cooled 
                          his fingers as he waited for the next round to begin, 
                          three of his friends had worked hard to take out the 
                          automated MPMG located on the corner that had mercilessly 
                          mowed down so many of their friends, but now they had 
                          all left. Left him alone to face the six vampires that 
                          he was about to slaughter, and rescue the pretty maiden 
                          that intel told them was located somewhere in the city.<br>
                          Suddenly, like the cries of a movie, the next round 
                          of assault begins &#8220;Lights, Camera&#8230;. ACTION&#8221;</font></p>
                        <p><font color="#999999">Quickly he rushed to a high vantage 
                          point on top of the closest building to await the onslaught. 
                          Passing the gun emplacement that had caused so much 
                          damage, for a moment he wondered who would be evil enough 
                          to provide these unholy creatures with such a deadly 
                          weapon, but as the first vamp crossed into his line 
                          of sight, there was nothing but pure concentration. 
                          He rested the deadly rifle hard against his shoulder, 
                          and clicked the setting on the scope, 2x, 4x 6x, rested 
                          the cross hairs cleanly between the eyes of the oncoming 
                          face of hell, and lightly squeezed the trigger&#8230;.</font></p>
                        <p><font color="#999999">Almost instantly, the scull of 
                          his foe disappeared in a gush of blood, catapulted some 
                          distance away by the force of the shot, the headless 
                          corpse slumping lifeless to the floor, but something 
                          was wrong, like a sixth sense, the marine knew he was 
                          in trouble, as he moved the scope from his eyes, a slight 
                          sound of dislodged tiles told him to watch his back, 
                          spinning round he was greeted by a snarling face and 
                          a hefty shotgun. Shooting from the hip, he pumped a 
                          round into the legs of the oncoming vamp, stumbling 
                          slightly; it raised its shotgun to its shoulder and 
                          pumped off two rounds, glancing his waist, the force 
                          knocking him to the ledge below, and breaking his leg.</font></p>
                        <p><font color="#999999">Crippled, he pulled his knife 
                          from his tunic, clasped it firmly between his thumb 
                          and forefinger, and flung it at where he&#8217;d just 
                          been, a tell tale &#8216;glurp&#8217; and the dead vamp 
                          fell to the ground, the knife lodged firmly in its heart.</font></p>
                        <p><font color="#999999">Fashioning a splint from some 
                          wood that was lay next to him, he bandaged his wounds 
                          and stood up straight, walked over and picked up the 
                          gleaming shotgun. Nice, this was going come in handy.</font></p>
                        <p><font color="#999999">He crossed the street, making 
                          for the police station, hoping for help; instead he 
                          was greeted by another narled face, straddling his old 
                          M4 assault rifle. Pumping a shell out of the shotgun, 
                          he wedged thousands of metal bearings cleanly in its 
                          chest, barely making a sound it toppled backwards and 
                          fell in a heap on the floor, followed by several other 
                          body parts.</font></p>
                        <p><font color="#999999">Quickly he ran up some stairs, 
                          and through a wooden door, a shrill cry for help told 
                          him he was close. As he rounded the corner, there she 
                          was, beautiful red hair, and bound tightly in the corner 
                          of the room. He ran over and cut her bonds. With barely 
                          a murmur she picked herself up and headed for the door, 
                          no amount of calling could get her back. So, pulling 
                          his sword from its holster, he ran after her. </font></p>
                        <p><font color="#999999">But what&#8217;s this? Was he 
                          too late? A succession of rapid fire from what sounded 
                          like an MP5 cut into his soul, as he bounded down the 
                          stairs, the wounded hostage limped towards him, as he 
                          traversed the gap that signalled his exit from the building 
                          there it stood, MP5 in hand, ready to pump him full 
                          of lead. <a href="http://mods.moddb.com/gallery/964/2211/" target="_blank">He 
                          swung viciously at the vampires throat</a>, just as 
                          its gun started to sound, cleanly the blade sliced its 
                          neck, bullets bouncing harmlessly of his blade, before 
                          one ricochet cut into his arm. </font></p>
                        <p><font color="#999999">Not having time to bandage, he 
                          swung round to see the gorgeous red head running away, 
                          close to the wall. As he took off after her again he 
                          lost sight of her for a moment. Just as he got her back 
                          into view, a sharp pain in his hip seamed to shove him 
                          to one side, glancing to his left he saw a mean looking 
                          vampire, up close and personal, as he readied his blade 
                          for some more action, facing his enemy, a large explosion 
                          from behind him told him it was all over, as he span 
                          through the air, he caught a glimpse of a vampire he 
                          hadn&#8217;t seen, clutching a sawn-off shotgun. </font></p>
                        <p><font color="#999999">As his shredded torso hit the 
                          floor, and he felt the world become dark, he watched 
                          as the hostage climbed into a waiting car, and disappeared 
                          into the distance, safe at last.</font></p>
