                          recently, but still, ltktbm goes on. Bugfixing and spring cleaning are the name of the game, along with a small demo app for for the q2a3d audio engine. With time being so limited actually implimenting the tbm_ai sdk has proven impossible for now, although my future plans for the whole tbm ai engine nessessitate its completion, its still remains disjointed from the overall package it will be upon completion. however several recent developements have been added to the specification. A big one of these is a 'map AI compiler'. route generation is already automated to the point of making good routes relatively simple, the map compiler will build on this to make the entire process automated, along with outputting relevent data for the sound engines environment files, and ensuring realistic area definitions for the AMP-G2 tables. </font></p>
                        <p><b><font color="#CCCCCC" size="4">.Plan 01/09/03</font></b></p>
                        <p><font color="#CCCCCC">With the release of 1.7b much 
                          of the initial work and developement is now out of the 
                          way, however as always, there is still much todo. 1.8 
                          internal testing has already begun, and structure for 
                          the bot SDK (now known as TBM_AI SDK) has been finalized 
                          and decided. much of this SDK will focus on two aspects, 
                          pathfinding and AI choices. Although, to date, much 
                          of LTKTBM's developement has focus'd on simulating a 
                          multiplayer game within a single player environment, 
                          the TBM_AI SDK is looking like it will focus more on 
                          providing customizable 'monsters' that can be added 
                          in game with little or no impact on the multiplayer 
                          environment. Much of the game engine is now finalized, 
                          and whilst there are still some areas I would really 
                          like to see improved (clientside skeletal animation 
                          is one of the things we've been talking about in the 
                          past, along with further developement on the network 
                          encryption) most engine developement will, for now, 
                          probably focus on bux fixes and optimizations. So, as 
                          everything stands at the moment 1.8 will be more of 
                          a single player content release, fixes and optimizations.</font></p>
                        <p><b><font color="#CCCCCC" size="4">.Plan 14/04/03</font></b></p>
                        <p><font color="#CCCCCC">Well, alot has happened since 
                          my last .plan, much more of the structure for the final 
                          release has been finalised, and phase 1 is virtually 
                          complete. I've decided that the best way to impliment 
                          more of the AI features is to move directly onto phase 
                          2, This involves the production of a bot SDK. This SDK, 
                          which will be released under GPL license and is entirely 
                          my own code, will allow 2 things, 1st, it will allow 
                          both commercial and non commercial projects to impliment 
                          bot AI quickly and easily into their projects, get a 
                          feel for how they perform and generally get better AI 
                          into their games with the minimal of hassle. 2nd: It 
                          will allow non commercial projects, and commercial projects 
                          under license to use proprietry SAI code by simply swapping 
                          a DLL whilst not actually having access to the source. 
                          The A3D engine I have been developing over the past 
                          few weeks will also take a similar route, although no 
                          licensing requirements will be impossed.I've been spending 
                          most of my time checking through content and making 
                          sure as much detail is added as possible,</font></p>
                        <p><font color="#CCCCCC">1.45RC2 just needs some more 
                          testing and actually putting together as an update. 
                          Once this is out, work can move directly onto full release 
                          version 1.5, bringing together all the various aspects 
                          I have been updating, and putting the final packages 
                          together. The A3D SDK, and new engine source will be 
                          available with full release, once everythings settled 
                          down with that I'll work on putting together the bot 
                          SDK. Its looking quite likely that the bot SDK will 
                          progress as a seperate, none priority project that I 
                          develope in any spare time I have.</font></p>

                          still has to be implimented, whilst this will not bring 
                          any immediate improvements to the bots performance (possibly 
                          a mild speed improvement) it will make implimenting, 
                          testing and troubleshooting the bots performance easier 
                          and therefore more efficient.</font></p>
                        <p><font color="#CCCCCC">The next release will therefore 
                          also include some more features that were origonally 
                          in the 2.3 version of TBM code that gave the AI greater 
                          access to learn about its surroundings, although this 
                          will be hard at first due to the incompatibility between 
                          v2.3 and the new AI structure, it is required to impliment 
                          the AI 'normalising' proceedure that was never present 
                          in 2.3. The following cabailities are also likely to 
                          be implimented in the next release: Camp, Charge, Form 
                          learnt Formation (not seen before and v. cool) and patrol, 
                          whereas they are currently limited to patrol code - 
                          not very clever with a sniper.</font></p>

                          still undecided on exactly how this will work, I have 
                          been playing with a few ideas and may impliment a 'testing' 
                          feature in the next release which allows formation of 
                          missions. My origonal idea was to base this on deathmatch 
                          mode, but after further consideration, it will probably 
                          work on a server variable which controls teamplay type. 
                          Actcity3 immediately lends itself to such a mission, 
                          given the number of places which offer themselves for 
                          camping/patroling/holding etc. There wont be any extra 
                          score system implimented in this release, but I had 
                          a thought of maybee setting up a league table system 
                          based on how well human players do in these missions.</font></p>

                          on some maps, even to the point of only being able to 
                          traval anticlockwise around actcity3)</font></p>
                        <p><font color="#CCCCCC">The new build has several manouvering 
                          fixes, based on the results of the map testing, fixing 
                          most crouching/jumping bugs on the maps I've tested, 
                          there are still a few to whittle out.</font></p>

                          to be implimented, not much of an issue atm, since we 
                          still have 52 maps to walk through and test, however 
                          I will take a look at the code and see how much of a 
                          job this is going to be.</font></p>
                        <p><font color="#CCCCCC">Next release will feature the 
                          first implimentation of the new AI, nothing special, 
                          but should make them more playable, basically I'm going 
                          to tie in the weapon code to the AI structure, One of 
                          the problems I had when I first started work on the 
                          AI was that of forgetting infomation, Previously the 
                          infomation grew and grew and would eventually overflow, 
                          I found the answer in a most unusal place, CD ripping!!, 
                          the new 'forget code' works in a similar way to the 
                          way CD rippers 'normalise' CD volume..</font></p>
                        <p><font color="#CCCCCC">Next release will include a 'rotate 
                          maps' option, allowing the server to rotate through 
                          maps when no human clients are connected, usefull for 
                          debugging and generating stats on the bots.</font></p>

                          release gives the bots the oppertunity to use the sniper 
                          scope, still have to decide how to limit the bots vision 
                          when they are zoomed in, which will probably be included 
                          in the release after next (when they have the ability 
                          to decide which is the best level of zoom)</font></p>
                        <p><font color="#CCCCCC">I am shortly going to be putting 
                          together a 'full install' file, so people new to AQ2

                          a map, but since I'm trying to keep all BORG knowledge 
                          to being learnt in real time the code for this is in 
                          their standered learning code (it is also a lot easier 
                          to code), how to use this cover is still constantly 
                          updated so this should not provide any problems with
