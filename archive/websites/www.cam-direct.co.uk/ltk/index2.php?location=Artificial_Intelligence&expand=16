<tr><td class='forum2' width='59%'><H1><strong>Artificial Intelligence???</strong> </H1>
<p>Having just completed my first taught AI program, I think it is time to well 
  and truly put TBM in its place.</p>
<p>First and foremost on the agenda, is to tackle the common misconception when 
  it comes to defining what AI actually is. In this program we considered 4 mutually 
  exclusive definitions of AI:</p>
<p>&#8226; AI as acting humanly. as typified by the Turing test<br>
  &#8226; AI as thinking humanly. cognitive science.<br>
  &#8226; AI as thinking rationally. as typified by logical approaches.<br>
  &#8226; AI as acting rationally. the intelligent agent approach.</p>
<p>Let me suggest, this, unfortunate state of affairs is where common understanding 
  of AI meets its first fundamental flaw (of which there are many!).</p>
<p>AI, for successful implementation should realistically be broken into two separate 
  symbiotic areas with one subgroup.</p>
<p>&#8226;<A onmouseover="return escape('The noun understanding has 4 senses<BR>Skipping the first few&#8230;<BR>4. reason, understanding, intellect -- (the capacity for rational thought  or inference or discrimination;)<BR>The verb understand has 5 senses<BR>1. understand -- (know and comprehend the nature or meaning of;)<BR>2. understand, realize, realise, see -- (perceive (an idea or situation) mentally;<br>3. understand, read, interpret, translate -- (make sense of a language;)<br>4. understand, infer -- (believe to be the case;)<br>5. sympathize, sympathise, empathize, empathise, understand -- (be understanding of;)')"><B><u>AI

  &#8226;<A onmouseover="return escape('The noun creativity has 1 sense <br>1. creativity, creativeness, creative thinking -- (the ability to create).<br>The noun creation has 6 senses<br>1. creation, creative activity -- (the human act of creating)<br>2. creation -- (an artifact that has been brought into existence by someone)<br>3. creation, conception -- (the event that occurred at the beginning of something; )<br>4. initiation, foundation, institution, origination, innovation, introduction, -- (the act of introducing something new;)<br>5. Creation -- Gods act of bringing the universe into existence<br>6. universe, creation, world -- (everything that exists anywhere;)<br>')"><B><u>AI 
  as creativity.</u></B></A><br>
  <br>
  The Borg Matrix AI system is already well progressed into the first two, which 
  you may find surprising given the second&#8217;s obvious lack of formal, scientific 
  definition. </p>
<p>A recent question, proposed by a colleague, was &#8220;how do these three areas 
  tie in with the more accepted research into AI, such as movement, image recognition, 
  game theory and tasks such as chess etc&#8221;.</p>
<p>The answer is its simplest form, is they don&#8217;t. Consider this; is a blind, 
  immobile person unintelligent?</p>
<p>Intelligence transcends our physical capabilities to complete a certain task; 
  the importance is in the ability to understand why these tasks are needed, the 
  ability to learn the hows and whys of the rules of the system, and the intuition 
  to know when these rules can (or need) be broken. </p>
<p>I will leave the explaining further of intuition and understanding for now, 
  I could go into an entire essay on the results of some of the observed intuition 
  effects of the TBM_AI system but with no way to prove how or why this came about 
  with the introduction of the system, I am happy, for now, just to explain that 
  part of the system was originally specifically aimed at creating a sense of 
  intuition, but in the end, this was superseded by the more abstract algorithms 
  which handle understanding.</p>
<p>However the main topic I wish to forward for now, is AI as creativity.</p>
<H1>AI as creativity</H1>
<p>The core problem that creativity presents for an AI system is that of quality. 
  Creativity, in its general sense, is actually extremely easy. A systems ability 
  to create is surprisingly simple, and something I only really understood formally 
  more recently during an explanation of the Non-deterministic Polynomial complete 
  set of problems, you can garner a better understanding of this by carefull examination and understanding of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_prime" target="_blank">illegal primes</a>. It all boils down to the creation of random numbers, combinatorics 
  and symbolic assignment.</p>
<p>To put it in its simple English form. Make a random number, use that as a template 
  for your creation, then if that number is &#8216;good&#8217; create new things 
  by using that random number in other random templates.</p>
<p>Hopefully, alarm bells should be ringing in your head right about now. Say 
  hello to intuition.</p>
<p>As I said at the start, the problem with creativity is quality. Creativity 
  is the ultimate NP Complete problem. Combined with the sense of how can it be 
  possible to test if a creation is &#8216;good&#8217;, what separates the good 
  from the bad, and how does this change between one creation and another.</p>
<p>In the primary case, this is the reason behind the LTBTBM project (licence 
  to breed). To give the TBM_AI system a domain to tread into this area, and help 
  formulate a final algorithm which can be used (even if it&#8217;s phenomenally 
  slow, optimization has already been proved to work well by using higher level 
  definitions of objects, and formalising heuristic progression should help things 
  further), for arranging and testing various theoretical creations. </p>
<p>Some very interesting work has been done in this area in the form of genetic 
  algorithms.</p>
<p>However, for the most part, these are still limited to solving particular problems, 
  and designed to meet specific predefined goals, the trick now is to present 
  a clear algorithm which combines all the current forms of AI, meshes them together 
  to produce a system which runs with autonomy and can be guided as to the particular 
  problems we wish to be solved, discovering the intricacies and sub goals for 
  itself. </p>
<p>Enter: The Borg Matrix. As mentioned in my earlier <a href="vstbm.shtml">article 
  of where TBM_AI fits into the AI domain</a>, a significant benefit, is it provides 
  a method of producing a solid, self regulating system. It forms a glue which 
  allows the abstract definition of presentation techniques and methods, to formulate 
  its own goals, test and self supervise with the ultimate goal of forwarding 
  its own survival (optimally defined in a abstract sense).</p>
<p>This leads me nicely into some of the more moralistic questions related to 
  AI. Isaac Asimof was probably among the greatest of men when it comes to theoretical 
  analysis of the implications of AI of this nature, for anyone who hasn&#8217;t 
  read his Foundation and Robot City series, he deals with more issues (in the 
  form of science fiction) than I could ever hope to exhibit here. However there 
  are three important, key points I would like to point out.</p>
<p>&#8226;<A onmouseover="return escape('The noun promise has 2 senses<br>1. promise -- (a verbal commitment by one person to another agreeing to do (or not to do) something in the future)<br>2. promise, hope -- (grounds for feeling hopeful about the future;)The verb promise has 4 senses<br>1. promise, assure -- (make a promise or commitment)<br>2. promise -- (promise to undertake or give;)<br>3. predict, foretell, prognosticate, call, forebode, anticipate, promise -- (make a prediction about; tell in advance;)<br>4. promise -- (give grounds for expectations;)')"><B><U>AI (can be made to) always keep its promises.</U></B></A><br>
  &#8226;<A onmouseover="return escape('  The noun truth has 5 senses<br>1. truth -- (a fact that has been verified;)<br>2. truth, the true, verity, trueness -- (conformity to reality or actuality;)<br>3. truth, true statement -- (a true statement;)<br>4. accuracy, truth -- (the quality of being near to the true value;)<br>5. Truth, Sojourner Truth -- (United States abolitionist and feminist who was freed from slavery and became a leading advocate of the abolition of slavery and for the rights of women (1797-1883))</p>')"><B><U>AI (can be made to) always tell the truth.</U></B></A></p>
<p>&#8226;<B><U>An AI agent system of this nature ALREADY exists and is many, many years into 
  developement..</U></B></p>
<p>When you bring the definition of AI under the top three headings, something 
  that is worth considering is that of the internet. The internet becomes a mammoth, 
  dynamic and interlinked Artificial Intelligence system, the likes of which is 
  still considered science fiction by most.</p>
<p>The easiest way, I think, to visualise this, is to abstract out the human interactions. 
  Consider them instead, as semi intelligent agents, less than the whole, moving 
  about the system, creating, imparting intuition to other areas and contributing 
  to understanding and formulation of the system as a whole. Once you do this, 
  the AI tree becomes more obvious, the human agents of the system are not the 
  only ones doing this. Agents become as diverse as programs, games, data acquisition 
  and representation systems (such as weather and other satellites and their homes). 
  The internet is continuously evolving, already far above and beyond any individual 
  agent, be that the human end user, or the satellite collating its information. 
  Admittedly at this moment in time its evolution and expansion is ultimately 
  dependant upon us, but much less so than the simple AI robots trying to learn 
  to play a decent game of football. On top of this, the very distributed nature 
  of the internet is tremendously resilient to catastrophic disasters. In the 
  world of the internet, a catastrophic failure exists more as a small brain haemorrhage, 
  taking out small sections only and leaving the greater portion intact. In fact, 
  it is easily arguable that the internet (in some form) is already more capable 
  of surviving a complete catastrophic failure of the earth, than we are as a 
  species.</p>
<p>Continuing on this theme, consider Google (in fact any search engine would 
  do, but googs is the best example). </p>
<p>Google as an Intelligent Agent: Without getting to deep into the technologies 
  and algorithms behind Google search, there are two important points you should 
  bear in mind. Firstly, Google works so well because it is a distributed system, 
  its database is spread across a wide spectrum of hardware. Secondly, Google&#8217;s 
  answers are not fundamentally based on any direct human input (other than those 
  who created the pages in the first place). Given the simply mind boggling data 
  transfer that the Google system handles, such a thing would quite simply be 
  impossible for a human to handle, in actual fact, even a collaborative group 
  of humans struggles to provide indexing of as high quality. However, Google, 
  as it browses the internet does not have access to any more or less information 
  than you sat here reading this. </p>
<p>In short, we have a lot to learn from the internet when it comes to AI systems 
  design, to exist and work well, fundamentally it requires modularity, compatibility 
  and diversity. AI can expand upon every aspect of our lives, from its most fundamental 
  aspects of teaching and learning, through research and design, and all the way 
  up to organising and controlling governments, their actions and their points 
  of view. To this end we are already much closer to the realms of science fiction 
  than many of us would care to believe.</p>
<p>Many, many disaster theories have been presented with relation to AI, on the 
  surface, the most viable I believe is that presented in the Animatrix sub-story 
  of the Matrix films, in which &#8216;liberals&#8217;, wishing to preserve the 
  &#8216;life&#8217; of AI allows them to develop their own city, which eventually 
  comes back to haunt us as the city grows and wages war on the rest of humanity.</p>
<p>Isaac Asimof takes a different tact, here robots are loathed by earthly society, 
  but widely overused by earth migrants (who unsurprisingly leave earth using 
  ships with engines invented by the AI itself). Here the story is controlled 
  overall by a robot AI with very special capabilities and which at the combined 
  stories pinnacle creates a completely symbiotic world which is ultimately fated 
  to be the best choice for the future of the human race.</p>
<p>Of the many theories related to what separates us from other animals, This 
  definition of AI also presents a simple answer. Creation: Non human animals 
  undoubtedly possess understanding and intuition, but lack in any formidable 
  sense our most valued gift; The ability to create. Now I&#8217;m sure that is 
  not entirely true, all animals have the ability to create in some form or other, 
  be that birds designing nests for their young, to beavers constructing intricate 
  dams to provide and protect themselves and their family.</p>
<p>However, in this respect, I am not entirely convinced we have much in the way 
  of any superior, innate ability to create. Our superior abilities seem to come, 
  again from our ability to communicate our creations between each other. Despite 
  what it may appear to the casual observer, Mans true creations are actually 
  very few and far between, the majority of our species never truly create on 
  a regular basis, and even those who consider themselves &#8216;creative&#8217; 
  seem to spend most of their time either rehashing work that has gone before 
  them, or simply recreating work that has already been done. In this respect, 
  the Internet as a single entity is far superior to any one of us, collating, 
  organising and disseminating our creations and experiences. It has very quickly 
  become our single, most respected point of call for all information and ideas. 
  As we move slowly into the new millennium this creature is already demolishing 
  borders, and challenges even the most talented of individuals to hold it back 
  against its will. Internet warfare is not the guns and death scenarios of old, 
  it is a continual battle of combined wills which has led to the near deification 
  of an entity that most have failed to note in existence or substance. Where 
  this will take us I cannot, and dare not answer, but the fact that the efficiency 
  it provides as an open and evolving beast has so far destroyed all attempts 
  to halt it in every facet, meaning those who refuse or simply ignore its possibilities 
  find themselves suddenly left behind in a world that previously seemed unchanging.</p>
<p>For those who are wondering, how does this description of the internet fit 
  in with the first two, key points: </p>
<p>&#8226;<A onmouseover="return escape('The noun promise has 2 senses<br>1. promise -- (a verbal commitment by one person to another agreeing to do (or not to do) something in the future)<br>2. promise, hope -- (grounds for feeling hopeful about the future;)The verb promise has 4 senses<br>1. promise, assure -- (make a promise or commitment)<br>2. promise -- (promise to undertake or give;)<br>3. predict, foretell, prognosticate, call, forebode, anticipate, promise -- (make a prediction about; tell in advance;)<br>4. promise -- (give grounds for expectations;)')"><B><U>AI (can be made to) always keep its promises.</U></B></A><br>
  &#8226;<A onmouseover="return escape('  The noun truth has 5 senses<br>1. truth -- (a fact that has been verified;)<br>2. truth, the true, verity, trueness -- (conformity to reality or actuality;)<br>3. truth, true statement -- (a true statement;)<br>4. accuracy, truth -- (the quality of being near to the true value;)<br>5. Truth, Sojourner Truth -- (United States abolitionist and feminist who was freed from slavery and became a leading advocate of the abolition of slavery and for the rights of women (1797-1883))</p>')"><B><U>AI (can be made to) always tell the truth.</U></B></A></p>
<p>Well, let me deal with truth first. The problem with truth is it&#8217;s almost 
  never clearly defined. Something can always be accepted as true until it is 
  proven otherwise; The world is flat, there&#8217;s a monster in the cupboard, 
  the sky will fall, have all been accepted truths by someone in one time of our 
  history or another. The best we can do with truth is to always strive to prove 
  something false. Once this is done, we are left only with the most likely truths, 
  which simply must be accepted until such time as either they are disproved, 
  or replaced by an alternative possibility at which time truth is replaced by 
  belief.</p>
<p><H2>Truth:</H2>
  In this aspect of the internet, it is one of its greatest strengths, and probably 
the greatest drive behind its success. With such an uncountable number of avenues 
of information collation, falsities are quickly uncovered and exposed, and for 
those who wish to find them truths irrepressible in their very nature.
<p><H2>Promise:</H2>
Of the keeping of promises: A promise is a strange thing:<BR>This aspect of the internet 
is probably, currently its greatest flaw. Whilst AI in general can be set to keep 
humanly infeasible promises (such as the surrendering or keeping of its greatest 
assets) a promise is limited by the ability of the agent to complete the task 
it has agreed to complete. However when considered in this sense, the Internet 
takes the most noble of stances. As a single entity it promises nothing, it just 
does, it is, and it will be.</p> 
<p>One last side note, why <a onmouseover="return escape(' TBM vs Others')" href="index2.php?location=TBM_vs_Others&expand=28" target=_blank">Borg and Matrix?</a> <br>
  Well, despite obvious similarities of these two concepts and ideas with their 
  associated fictional and non-fictional ideas, The actual linkage between The 
  Borg Matrix and these two is actually rooted in the common language definition 
  of these words. Borg, a.k.a Cyborg:- &#8220;a human being whose body has been 
  taken over in whole or in part by electromechanical devices&#8221; represents 
  the requirement of unencumbered linkage of TBM_AI for human and agent interaction 
  and communication. More interesting is Matrix, this again symbolises the collection 
  of information, its representation and manipulation.</p>
<p>Hopefully the ideas presented in this document can help improve understanding 
  of a realistic and more comprehensive definition of AI, its implications and 
  systems that already exist. After all, if you don&#8217;t understand what AI 
  is, how can you possibly hope to work with, understand, and develop these systems? 
  - All things none of us can avoid, whether we know it or not.</p>
