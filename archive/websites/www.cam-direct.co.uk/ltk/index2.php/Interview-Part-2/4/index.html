<tr><td class='forum2' width='59%'>Evil santa: Q from madman: Erm hes one one of the managers here. But er but if 
you two were also big into the communities a few years ago, or actually from six 
months ago he used to run the sub _____ or the first to strike clans. Erm, he 
wanted to know, what has erm, old action quake 2 players &#8211; can they do to 
help you rebuild the action quake 2 community.
<p>He himself wont play because of the cheaters.</p>
<p>mSparks: Basically try and build the community, try and encourage people to 
  get involved and back on.</p>
<p>E.S. definitely, always been a legit player myself. What servers do you play 
  on mSparks? &#8211; laughs &#8211; gimps accusing me of hacking.</p>
<p>mSparks: not really been on too many servers myself. Most of my time is spent 
  just getting things working. Most of the time, I&#8217;ll just use the server 
  minibrowser, fire that up and use that to connect to a server to play on.</p>
<p>E.S. OK lets figure out your style of play. I know I&#8217;ll personally run 
  around with the hand cannon, jump into the action right away, or sneak up behind 
  people, erm jumping person. Are you more of a sniper person, or do you like 
  to hide behind corners with an M4.</p>
<p>mSparks: Been more of an M4 &#8211; laser sight personally, I tend to generally 
  change my style depending on if I&#8217;m losing. If I&#8217;m starting to get 
  beaten I&#8217;ll swap to something else, I quite like playing with the sword 
  now, we had some good games with friends setting up servers&#8230;.</p>
<p>E.S: woo woo woo, a sword? Tell me about this.</p>
<p>mSparks: erm&#8230; it&#8217;s a sword. Theres two modes. Slashing, which is 
  like the knife only longer range. And defending which can be used to block incoming 
  assaults to you.</p>
<p>E.S.: Really? So guys actually built and integrated a sword. Sorry I&#8217;m 
  quite curious about this. I might get an LTKTBM server going right now, because 
  I want to play with the sword. That&#8217;s awesome dude.</p>
<p>mSparks: Well that&#8217;s one of the things we&#8217;ve tried to do with it. 
  Action quake to me has always been &#8211; it movie themed &#8211; it&#8217;s 
  taking action scenes from movies and playing them out, and the sword is always 
  something I thought was missing. Its generally seamed to go down quite well, 
  but because of the lack of actual servers at the moment its something that probably 
  a lot of people don&#8217;t know about.</p>
<p>E.S. Yeah definitely, I had no idea, I see lots of people going over there 
  like &#8220;a sword, wholey c##p. like erm MadMan yeah, interesting. 10 bucks 
  says he&#8217;s going to download the client in the next hour or two and like, 
  we&#8217;re going to figure out a way to get a server up and running over in 
  America and like me and him are going to go at it one and one after we pop off 
  air. OK just given me I&#8217;ve done martial arts, I&#8217;ve done dungeons 
  and dragons, I&#8217;ve got friends who are in the SCA society for creative 
  acronism, what kind of sword is it, I&#8217;ve gotta ask.</p>
<p>mSparks: Erm, long, [laughs]</p>
<p>E.S. just a regular long sword, like medieval style, or kantanga style, just 
  a regular long sword?</p>
<p>mSparks: Err, more like a samurai, A guy know as BirdMan, who does some models 
  and work for the ReactionQuake3 stuff did the model for it. I took the skin 
  from a samurai sword to map onto it, single handed sword.</p>
<p>E.S. Damn, that sword just like sparked my interest in every way shape or form, 
  and I think I&#8217;m getting a hard-on right now just because of it. What other 
  new stuff, like I know that LTKTBM has the blood splatter trails, by the end 
  of a match on a server playing [on the map] action city 2, earlier today, and 
  by the end of it, the middle of the map was just like complete redness. Is that 
  something that you guys came up with, or something that you guys integrated; 
  how does that work?</p>
<p>mSparks: Its come from several sources, it&#8217;s a mix between Q2ICE, which 
  is a (discontinued) Quake 2 client which did a lot of work on the program code 
  to stain game maps, another project made &#8216;decal&#8217; code which is used 
  for more detailed effects such as bullet holes and small splatters, and the 
  other one is my own work on client side debris, its bits of the map like wood 
  and grass and rocks which are disturbed as bullets impact on various different 
  surfaces. Which I think just add that little bit extra to the visual effects 
  as you play.</p>
<p>E.S. Yeah, I definitely noticed the new visual effects, and I&#8217;m loving 
  them to death. The only gripe that I have is it&#8217;s a little bit too dark 
  for me, but that&#8217;s just because I like to brighten everything up. Using 
  the gl_modulate command in the original release of the Quake 2 engine. The one 
  thing I&#8217;d like to expand on for the AQ2 players out there, if you were 
  to go ahead, and get the LTKTBM stand alone client, the blood splatters that 
  I&#8217;ve been using &#8211; You&#8217;ll get shot by someone using the sniper 
  rifle, in the legs, or in the chest and you&#8217;ll actually see the spray, 
  and you&#8217;ll see it on the ground, so you know - its almost as if it&#8217;s 
  a clue into where the person is shooting you from. Do you think that might actually 
  hamper the game play, or is that a benefit. I think it&#8217;s a benefit to 
  the players that know how to use it, but what&#8217;s your opinion on it?</p>
<p>mSparks: Its something that was talked about a lot as we put it together, and 
  tweeked the various settings, one of the other benefits that I personally find 
  very useful is &#8211; I&#8217;ve done a lot of work with the sound engine &#8211; 
  using the creative openA(udio)L(ayer) library, which allows me to pull on the 
  work that they&#8217;ve done, the EAX technology, acoustics in different environments 
  such as caves, and one of the things that this does, is with a surround sound 
  audio system hooked into your machine, the sounds are placed all around the 
  room that your playing in, so if sound originates from behind you, it comes 
  from behind you, rather than just left and right. And even on stereo speakers, 
  it uses the &#8216;Aureal&#8217; &#8211; I think &#8211; which simulates that 
  effect on stereo speakers. </p>
<p>E.S. yeah, I did notice that with my speakers. How its actually more &#8216;surround 
  sound&#8217; than the original Q2 client. Wow, you guys are just doing so much 
  here that its just amazing, even as I find myself now, I go over to &#8216;All 
  Seeing Eye&#8217;, I copy the IP address, load up LTKTBM client, and just play 
  with that just because it rocks so much. The only major gripes I have are the 
  frames per second can drop and figuring out how to expand on that, and mess 
  around with the gl_modulate settings.</p>
<p>mSparks: This is probably related to the &#8216;pure client&#8217; setting, 
  which can be disabled under one of the menus.</p>
<p>E.S. OK. Definitely going to have to deal with that now. Is there anything 
  else that you think that we&#8217;ve missed, any new development, maps, anything 
  like that? Actually, quick question for you, have you been involved at all with 
  the CGF mod for Action Quake 2? </p>
<p>mSparks: Its true, there&#8217;s a lot of game mods like that around, TNG for 
  example which I think might be related to that. One of the things that I&#8217;ve 
  been looking towards, Is there&#8217;s an engine mod called Qfusion, with [map] 
  graphics far superiour to anything that can be done using Quake 2 based maps, 
  this actually lets you use Quake 3 based maps, so I&#8217;m hoping to get some 
  time to use a mod like TNG, with Qfusion, so you can use the reaction quake 
  3 content, which have better lighting than the maps that Quake 2 uses. One of 
  the gripes that I here about reaction quake, is to do with the greatly changed 
  physics used in Quake 3, but Qfusion uses Quake 2 physics on Quake 3 maps.</p>
<p>E.S. Definitely, I bought Quake 3 arena, just for the reaction quake mod, and 
  I played it like 5 times and then uninstalled everything and was like I&#8217;m 
  going back to my AQ2. Another thing, the competition between Action Quake 2 
  and Counter Strike Source, I haven&#8217;t played CS:Source myself, but I&#8217;ve 
  heard that its very similar, do you have any experience with this at all?</p>
<p>mSparks: Personally, I&#8217;m not overly keen on &#8216;valve&#8217;, I&#8217;ve 
  purposefully steered clear of Half Life 2 simply because of the way that they 
  treated the release, and the way that they&#8217;ve dealt with the issues they&#8217;ve 
  faced, and use things such as the source leak as a marketing ploy.</p>
<p>E.S. Yeah, I completely understand, there&#8217;s a lot of drama, and conspiracy 
  and everything else around the release of it. Speaking of Half-Life two. A new 
  engine has come out, Quake 4, I&#8217;ve seen some screenshots, it looks awesome, 
  what are your plans with that, are you going to integrate the action quake 2 
  community into that:- Are you going to help with the action team on Quake 4, 
  do you have any plans along these lines?</p>
<p>mSparks: I think that&#8217;s a matter of time, I know that akimbo productions 
  are generally quite active in scenes like these, for the moment at least I&#8217;ve 
  got a lot on my plate to be getting on with, It&#8217;ll definitely something 
  I&#8217;ll be evaluating. But something like that is not an easy job, and takes 
  a considerable amount of time. I&#8217;m also sold on the idea of keeping what 
  we have as a stand-alone package. I like the control it gives over the look 
  and feel that you just don&#8217;t get doing otherwise. From that side, the 
  most likely candidate is actually Quake 3, since the source is going GPL it 
  means we get this control in a more up to date engine.</p>
<p>E.S. Definitely, definitely, There&#8217;s a group putting together something 
  quake [3?] generations [arena?], what they&#8217;ve done is integrate doom, 
  quake 1/2/3 and return to castle wolfenstein, all the characters in it, you 
  can choose between which character you want, each character has its own individual 
  set of weapons, and they run off the original physics for that game. I&#8217;m 
  really curious as to what your thoughts are on this.</p>
<p>mSparks: [confused] its not something I&#8217;ve actually seen, definitely 
  sounds like quite a handful.</p>
<p>E.S. Its actually, from what I&#8217;ve read from it, - we&#8217;re actually 
  reviewing this next week - looking like its about 100% complete, and I&#8217;ve 
  heard lots of good things about it..</p>
<p>mSparks: It definitely sounds like a good idea, there&#8217;s a lot of this 
  sort of thing going on, which can only be good for everyone involved. I think 
  this is where communication plays such an important role, one of the problems 
  I&#8217;ve run across has been people putting work in, but not liking to share, 
  which is the sort of thing which does more harm than good. One of the things 
  I tend to do as a programmer, is keep things back and out of sight, but a key 
  goal of the work that I do is to try and make it useable by other areas of the 
  community.</p>
<p>E.S. Awesome about the AI. I want to go ahead and completely agree with you 
  on the whole sharing thing. That&#8217;s pretty much what gun radio is all about: 
  Stronger communities, stronger games, stronger everything. Every person has 
  their own unique talents, and individuality. If you combine all those talents 
  you end up with a better product. </p>
<p>mSparks: One of the reasons I&#8217;ve stuck with AQ2, is its what started 
  me off really being interested in the gaming scene, I was there when it originally 
  came out, watched it explode and sink back to where it is today. A lot of the 
  work that I do, I try to keep as modular as possible, the audio engine is something 
  that is actually out, and other people can use, there&#8217;s actually another 
  game out &#8211; paintball 2 &#8211; made by a guy called jitspoe. By breaking 
  the work that I do up, pieces that work out well can easily be used by others.</p>
<p>E.S. Any thoughts on actually upgrading the sound in LTKTBM, I know you guys 
  are using a lot of the original AQ2 sounds, radio commands and everything else, 
  are you guys thinking about getting some people together and adding new ones, 
  or bringing the current ones more up to date.</p>
<p>mSparks: ogg vorbis support is already integrated into the sound engine, although 
  this hasn&#8217;t been fully utilised in game as of yet. Anyone who fancies 
  the task, please feel free to put together something we can use.</p>
<p>E.S. One other thing with the new sound, Counter-strike, Unreal Tournament 
  2004. Voice to Voice communications. If action quake 2 had that, that would 
  rock, is there any possible way that this can be integrated?<br>
  mSparks: Yes! Its one of the things on the to do list [currently planned for 
  early 2006]. Some work has already gone into the network tools for this, VoIP 
  is one such route I&#8217;ve been investigating recently, someone else said 
  they would do it for us, but this unfortunately hasn&#8217;t happened, which 
  is a common problem, people come in, say they&#8217;re going to do something, 
  hang around for a few weeks and then disappear never to be seen again.</p>
<p>E.S. Wow, dude, that is just amazing, as soon as you guys can get that in, 
  AQ2 is just going to be revamped. One and a half times over. Im mean the game 
  itself is already just amazing, Ive been playing for six years now, and I play 
  all the new games that come out and its just there&#8217;s nothing like it out 
  there. Its all about the gameplay, the communities, the people involved, the 
  ladders, everything, its just Action Quake 2, if you haven&#8217;t got out there 
  and played it yet, I highly recommend you get the LTKTBM client, to test it 
  out and play it. Its got a lot of the basic maps involved to play it, a lot 
  of the servers you can download the maps on, which is definitely helpful. Other 
  than that, I would like to go ahead and thank mSparks for his time with this 
  interview. Is there anything else you&#8217;d like to add mSparks?</p>
<p>mSparks: Yeah, one of the things you just brought up there, the thing that&#8217;s 
  been taking up the most time, is the artwork for the maps. A lot of the maps 
  utilise the original Quake 2 artwork. Since we cant redistribute this we&#8217;ve 
  had to redo all the data that was originally in Quake 2, So if there&#8217;s 
  anybody there who is any good at artwork, we could really do with your help 
  to get these finished.</p>
<p>E.S. That brings me onto another point, is there any plans to integrate some 
  of the other sites, such as the actors guild, and map depot with LTKTBM.</p>
<p>mSparks: I think we&#8217;re managing quite well at the moment as individual 
  entities, we communicate at several different levels to get things done, I currently 
  spend some time providing AI files for each of the maps. I&#8217;m personally 
  not a mapper, and the map depot works very well in co-ordinating and expanding 
  the already vast array of maps. Its not as active as it has been, but its still 
  going strong.</p>
<p>E.S. Definitely, I know that DWL has a couple of mappers that are working really 
  hard on getting CTF maps together for their server ladder. So what I&#8217;m 
  trying to say, is maybe get them involved.</p>
<p>mSparks: Definitely.</p>
<p>E.S. anything else to add?</p>
<p>mSparks: I think that&#8217;s about me done.</p>
<p>E.S. thanks.<br>
