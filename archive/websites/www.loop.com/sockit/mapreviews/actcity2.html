<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Layout - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I like how the map was laid
out, not your typical boxed city. There are many excellent vantage
points for all types of players. You are able to enter a few of
the buildings, such as the casino and hotel, which will aid in
your defense when under fire. I was a bit upset when I opened
up the casino and found out I was unable to go anywhere. Basically
an 'L' shaped dead end, usually leading to your death because
nowhere to run. You can see a boarded up area, which has a long
corridor and a door, but is inaccessible. A corridor leading to
another portion of the map could have worked out well here. The
same can be said about Hotel Mancis, just a small lobby area with
an 'out of service' elevator, which would have worked out if it
operated to a second story floor. And finally, there are a few
stray doors, which are unable to be opened. Let us open them and
go somewhere! There is now access onto the roof area near the
building under construction and also between the buildings off
of Gaming Blvd. Overall, an excellent layout.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Textures &amp; Sky - Score
8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">No new detail added to actcity2.
The night sky is great, brushed with a partially cloudy sky and
shining stars. The sky definitely helps to set the overall tone
of the map, adding to it a bluish hue cast by the night time sky.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Prefabs - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This map really is a a real
beauty! The combination of building textures is excellent. Not
much detail inside the buildings you have access too. Although
a little more attention could have been paid to the closed windows,
which seem to all have the same brushed glare (Duke 3D) on them.
Not very original. The use of exterior lighting is wonderful.
Used on corner lampposts, and building underpasses. These effects
only help to set the tone of the map, giving it a nighttime setting
with the brightness of a full moon.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sounds - Score</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">N/A</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lighting - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The use of exterior lighting
is wonderful. A few of the street lights flicker under the night
sky which help to cast shadows. Such lights are used on corner
street posts, and building underpasses. These effects only help
to set the tone of the map, giving it a nighttime setting with
the brightness of a full moon.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Playability - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">All the files are zipped correctly
and unzip into the correct directories. The r_speeds are good,
averaging between 300-400 in most all of the city areas. There
was one minor spot at the top of the street which reached 500,
but this will be of no consequence.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Teamplay - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This map flows very well, even
in crowded games with as many as 7 per side. It also plays well
for both the sniper types and the heavy hitters who roll up on
you with the big weapons, such as the MP4, shotgun or machine
gun. Both will get there share of kills. Most of the action and
kills will take place in the screenshots above. The snipers love
to nest on top of the structure at the construction site and pick
of those willing to stick the head around the corner. There will
also be much action in the two buildings at the top of the street,
where teams will fight to control the map. This a favorite map
of the NT Clan as we spend many hours on this maps. If a game
gets too big, frags pile up quick and the streets become more
and more crowded. But is is well balanced for a solid teamplay
map. Teamplay usually ends in very bloody fire fights, where the
player with the best vantage point does not always come out victorious.
This being the sniper on top of the building under construction.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">DM - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As I stated previously, this
map does lend itself to all types of players. In DM, the weapons
are scattered throughout the entire map, with ample ammo available.
With the addition of a few steel beams, it is now easier to gain
access to the hand cannon and machine jump. No more do you have
to try to jump from the window to the light post.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Originality - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The original map started out
with blistering promise, but there is a major letdown on this,
the second version. There are changes, but not enough to really
make this a new map. The changes are minor and do not really add
to the overall game play. I still hold to my original feeling
that there needs to be more access to either the casino and/or
casino, up to a second level. One new fix was the way the doors
on the casino open. They now slide open which should lessen the
chance on getting stuck in the door.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">General Feel - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Acticty2 is a second attempt
to improve on the map. Not much improvement which makes you say,
&quot;wow.&quot; There was the addition of a few new areas, but
nothing the interior access is still lacking. This updated map
still deserves to be in most rotations. It can become a bit small
with too many players on it, but I have yet to get bored, playing
this map for a few hours at a time. In most games, I usually snipe
from the top of the construction site, waiting for my target to
appear. I do believe this version of actcity is dead, since actcity3
is completely different. Enjoy your game play on here, this is
a beautiful map. Take the time and do the download!</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Final Rating - Score 7.1
(64/9)</FONT></B>
