<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Layout - Score 9</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Gimp has created a very
unique map. Nothing which has been released previously can really
compare to lava tube. As the author describes, &quot; The lava
tube was inspired by a canyoning weekend I had in the Blue Mountains,
Sydney, Australia. Particular features that inspired me were the
lighting effects of natural sunlight bouncing down in to canyon.&quot;
This layout is very complex, similar to an elongated, oval with
random twists and turns through cavernous, rocky areas. This is
quite a large map also, but at times it is difficult to get your
bearings, without distinct features. A few areas, such as the
lake underground lake with the waterfall, the wooded area outside
the caves which are quite recognizable. The maps is played mainly
on one level, but there are a few areas which provide you with
a height advantage, allowing for ambush tactics. Weapon placement
in DM was few and far between, making locating one vital to your
survival. Throughout most of the round, players used the M4 and
MP5/10 as their weapon selections. Ammo was a bit more plentiful,
but without the correct weapon became useless. The lines of fire
were not straight forward, due to the fact there were few opportunities
to get a firm and level footing to take a shot. You always had
options and escape routes when you came under fire.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Textures &amp; Sky - Score
9</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">These are some of the most incredible
and realistic looking textures to date. No stone was left unturned
when he created the textures used here. Textures in the snb_tex
directory are the property of Skull'n Bones, which have been seen
before. You almost forget you are looking at a game when running
through the maps, the texture blend so well. There area variety
of textures depending on which area of the map you are on. The
trees are what caught my eye initially, they resemble nothing
which has been successfully accomplished previously. Trees usually
cause high r_speeds, but these trees are manageable. All the textures
mesh with the layout out the map to create a gorgeous cavernous
area.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Prefabs - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There are bit and prefabs that
were added to accentuate this maps, such as the trees, which are
beautifully designed and textures. Numerous outcroppings of rock
dot the caves and dirt trails. There is also a striped down, old
tree which you can climb to a higher level. The introduction of
anything else would have just hindered the overall game play.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sounds - Score 9</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lava tube comes alive with sound
depending on where you are situated on the map. The most prominent
sound inside the caverns being the flowing of water near the lake.
There are other sounds you will notice such as the dripping of
water, the sound of crickets chirping and numerous different birds
when you are outside near the wooded area. These sounds really
help to bring out the finer points on the map. All of the sounds
used fit the theme and none seem out of place. This is one way
to let teammates know where you are, by the surrounding sounds.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lighting - Score 10</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This, along with the textures
create all the ambience on the map. As the Gimp mentioned earlier,
&quot;lighting effects of natural sunlight bouncing down in to
canyon&quot; helped inspire him to create this map. These lightning
details are amazing. As you roam the caverns, rays of light shine
down onto the cavern. The map does hold its dark areas, but they
seemed to be kept to a minimum, as the maps is adequately lit.
There is one minor bug which The Gimp notes, &quot;currently a
tree has a small sliver of light that can be seen through it.&quot;
If you can find it, more power to you. Overall, this is the one
area in particular which enhances the game play and makes you
feel a part of the map.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Playability - Score 9</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I will let the author describe
this section. &quot;Due to the nature of this map's construction
only hefty machines of the 300mhz class or 3D accelerated machines
are likely to run this map well. If an average of the map were
take it would likely reveal an r_speed average of about 400 however
3 area's in particular have higher averages of about 700 and a
map peak of about 1200. So in short this map is not well suited
to software mode. That said, I have to admit that level is particularly
ugly in software mode and running it at 640x480 still yielded
a playable speed, not that I can see how anyone can play in that
pixilation blizzard :-).&quot; Two of those areas I mentioned
earlier, the lake/waterfall area and the wooded section on the
outside of the cave. All the files were lowercase and unzipped
correctly into their designated directories.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Teamplay - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">After spending quite a bit of
time in DM, we switched and played this map in TP. Most were impressed
with the looks of the map, but the game play lacked, partly due
to the overall size of the map. Teams were 7 a side, even that
made for long rounds, when teams were down to their final member.
There were some players who were walking around and unable to
find anyone to shoot for a few minutes. This discouraged some
and wanted to move on to a new map. Aside from that, most of the
action seemed to come was close proximity, usually seeing your
opponent at the last second. This partially due to the up and
down layout of the map. As I mentioned before most favored the
semi-automatic weapons, but it the the hand cannon and shutgun
which really excel on this map!</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">DM - Score 9</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This is a first, a map which
plays better at a deathmatch map then a teamplay map. Why? Because
you will happen to stumble upon some more often, who you can shoot,
unlike teamplay, where that number is decreased fifty percent.
Most of the rounds were spent with pistols as we learned were
the special use weapons were. Once you had a special weapon you
could really begin to inflict some pain. There was much</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Originality - Score 9</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Nothing like this map compares.
This is the most unique map I have played and reviewed. Sure there
are other maps which are set outdoors, but this map actually transports
you to those cave down in Australia. All the small parts, lighting,
sound, textures and layout work so well together that this map
just raised the bar for future releases.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">General Feel - Score 9</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Wow! I am still in awe over
the beauty of this map. From its layout to design, there does
not seem to be anything which was taken for granted. All the parts
were taken into consideration and nothing was left for granted.
As I stated before this map does play better for DM then it does
for TP. Your results may vary. Also, for the CTB fans, there are
respawn spot included in the map. I figure this would make a great
map for CTB, partially due to its overall size. We beware, this
is a hefty 3.54MB download, but it is more then worth it to check
this one out.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Final Rating - Score 8.7
(87/10)</FONT></B></P>
