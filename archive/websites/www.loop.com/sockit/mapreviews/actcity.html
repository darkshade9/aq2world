<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Layout - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Mancis Freeway is a simple,
yet ingenious layout and not your typical boxed city. It does
not provide for the best flow when engaged in a round on this
map. The map is divided into four distinct areas, all of which
are connected by the city street. First, there is the area near
the building under construction and casino, a very wide open area
with very few objects. The building is three stories high, all
of which can be accessed. There is an open room at the end of
the block, between the building and the casino. You are able to
enter the casino, are unable to go anywhere. Basically an 'L'
shaped dead end, usually leading to your death because nowhere
to run. You can see a boarded up area, which has a long corridor
and a door, which is inaccessible. The next area is actually an
intersection with connects the areas together. This seems to be
where most of the action takes place. At the end of this street
is a enclosed brick area, protected by a swinging gate. Walking
up the hill, you area surround by open windows on three side from
high above. A prime killing field. All rooms are possible to get
to, depending on your skills. The brick building has two levels
and two separate rooms on the top floor. At the top of the hill,
it opens into another dead end street, which is wide open and
offers nothing as protection. Lines of fire are very wide open
on the entire map. Just be wary of your position and your enemy.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Textures &amp; Sky - Score
8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The night sky is great, brushed
with a partially cloudy sky and shining stars. The sky definitely
helps to set the overall tone of the map, adding to it a bluish
hue cast by the night time sky. There is a small assortment of
textures used on the buildings throughout the city, from red brick
to rusted metal. The combination of building textures is excellent.
Not much detail inside the buildings you have access too. Although
a little more attention could have been paid to the closed windows,
which seem to all have the same brushed glare (Duke 3D) on them.
Not very original.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Prefabs - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Not much in the way of prefabs
used. The street corners have simple lampposts. The interior rooms
are filled with tables, chairs and book cases, all of with provide
nothing more then eye candy. There is also a dumpster in the enclosed
gated area.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sounds - Score</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">N/A</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lighting - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The majority of the city area
is dark, set under a bluish tint, seemingly given off by the night
sky and full moon. The use of exterior street lighting is well
used in conjunction with the setting. Street lights are positioned
throughout the city, most of which provide a small circular cascade
of light onto the ground. The interior lighting is just the opposite
and very bright, help to create that nighttime ambience.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Playability - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">All the files are zipped correctly
and unzip into the correct directories. The r_speeds are good,
averaging between 300-400 in most all of the city areas. There
was one minor spot at the top of the street which reached 500,
but this will be of no consequence.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Teamplay - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This map flows very well, even
in crowded games with as many as 7 per side. It also plays well
for both the sniper types and the heavy hitters who roll up on
you with the big weapons, such as the MP4, shotgun or machine
gun. Both will get there share of kills. Most of the action and
kills will take place around the intersection at the bottom of
the hill. Snipers love to nest on top and bottom of the structure
at the construction site and pick of those willing to stick the
head around the corner. There will also be much action in the
two buildings at the top of the street, where teams will fight
to control the map. If a game gets too big, frags pile up quickly
and the streets become more and more bloodied. It is well balanced
for a solid teamplay map. Teamplay usually ends in very bloody
fire fights, where the player with the best vantage point does
not always come out victorious. This being the sniper on top of
the building under construction.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">DM - Score</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">N/A</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Originality - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Yes, this is another city, but
it definitely has a different feel to it then say the urban series.
This all goes back to the layout and structure of the map, not
being the standard 'city block' map like urban or blood for example.
The only area I feel cheated by are the darkened window which
all have the same glare reflecting on them. There is a hidden
room included on this map. Find it, if you can. It would have
been to the mappers advantage to give further access in a few
of the buildings, as it would have aided in giving Mancis Freeway
a better, overall flow when playing engrossed in a round.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">General Feel - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This map definitely deserves
to be in most rotations. It can become a bit small with too many
players on it, but I have yet to get bored, playing this map for
a few hours at a time. In most games, I usually snipe from the
top of the construction site, waiting for my target to appear.
With a few changes and additions of hallways to some of the buildings,
this could be an outstanding map which suites both styles of play
even better. Take the time and do the download!</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Final Rating - Score 7.2
(58/8)</FONT></B>
