<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Here is how Holy Goat explains
what is included in Asylum: &quot;Mental hospital with private
rooms, operating theatre, ward, reception, life, stairs, cells,
padded room, interrogation chambers, coke machines, garden and
rec. room. I didn't base it on real life experiences, ok? =)&quot;
As he mentioned, the map is of a mental hospital, which is three
stories high. The map flows very well, for only have limited access
to the different floors. There is a single stairwell and an elevator.
Both at on end of the hall, across from each other. Each floor
differs from the next depending on where you are, the lower levels
have a waiting room and a small outdoor area. As you make your
way to level two, the hallway is laid out like the letter 'H',
with offices, padded cells and an operating room waiting to be
explored. The top floor consists of private rooms, a large ward
full of empty bed, and a reception desk. The layout is quite ingenious
and well laid out. The flow pattern does not seem to suffer with
the location of the stairwell and elevator. The lines of site
are not as simple as they first look. There are many twisting
hallways, rooms and objects obstructing your view. All the weapons
are spread equally throughout each level of the hospital. Ammunition
is also abundant as you make your way up and down the different
floors.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Textures &amp; Sky - Score
9</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Most all of the textures used
in Asylum are original work by Holy Goat. &quot;Thanks to the
guy who made Coventry for the textures I used; only two flat colour
ones, but it saved me making new ones, and your harddrive space
:).&quot; The textures are beautiful and really help to create
the ambience you feel when running though the mental hospital.
Generally, the hospital is set in the soothing color of white,
to keep the inmates from going crazy (but I guess that is why
they are there in the first place). The textures range from tiled
floors to padded cells and no detail was left out. For a good
example head to the third floor ward and look at the individual
beds. Great texture work! As an added bonus, the windows were
created using an animated textures. Initially there were supposed
to simulate rain in a thunderstorm, but the drops are a bit too
large and look similar to snowflakes. Still, this is nothing less
then spectacular and only add to the every growing ambience which
is created in Asylum.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Prefabs - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The prefabs looking great, thanks
in part to the wonderful textures Holy Goat has created. The most
recognizable are the beds, which can be seen in the private rooms
and the ward. Along with those, you will see nightstands, a electrical
wall unit, computer monitors, couches, tables, highly detailed
signs and even a functional dart board. The Coca-Cola machine
seems to be the only prefab which has been used on previous maps.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sounds - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The map comes alive with sound
on every level. Throughout the hallways and rooms, you can usually
hear the sound of falling rain. &quot;I put lightning [from a
pretty good flight sim], but it broke in later versions so I took
it out,&quot; says Holy Goat in the Read Me file. This small feature
would have been nice and added to the ambience, but is not really
missed due to the other sounds which cover the map. Other sounds
include &quot;a very short sample of a little-known song; the
artists are called Ouch!!!&quot; playing from the stereo up in
the ward on the third floor. There is also the sound of metal
doors of the cells, opening and closing on the second level when
the button is depressed. Overall, the sounds, combined with the
texture give you a sense, that you are actually in an asylum.
Not to mention being with a group of crazy who are trigger happy.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lighting - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The glow of the interior lighting
and the blue tint created by the windows really help to intensify
the overall setting. You get a shiver down your back, as the lighting
has an eerie glow which is cast upon the floors and the walls
of the asylum. The intensity of the lighting runs the entire spectrum,
depending on your location on the map. A few of the lower offices
and waiting areas are almost completely dark, while the operating
theater is very bright. But throughout the majority of the map,
the lighting is giving off an almost dulled glow. The windows
are mentioned previously engulf you in a light blue glow, which
gives way to the dulled white corridors as you move further away
from the glass windows.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Playability - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">All the files are in lower case,
zipped correctly and unzip into the correct directories. The r_speeds
average from 100-400 though most all of the levels. A few random
areas saw r_speeds creep a bit higher into the 500-600 range.
The worst area was on the third floor standing near the couch
and looking toward 'Room 27.' R_speeds jumped as high as 840,
but that is within standards and pose no problems while playing
over the internet. Overall a great attempt to keep the speeds
manageable, making fluid game play.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">One must be fast on their toes
when the round begins and grab a specialized weapon. The map started
with four players and slowly crept up to ten players in the matter
of a few rounds. This made finding and holding onto a special
weapon all the more difficult. With kills piling up on the map,
it was not uncommon to run around with akimbo pistols for a majority
of the round. Kills came rather fast and the game flowed very
well, considering the bottleneck which could be created around
the stairwell area. Game play was scattered throughout all floors.
Some players got trapped or happened to spawn inside the cells
and were trapped until another player either killed them of pressed
the button and released them. The sniper rifle seemed the most
difficult weapon to master on this map. This is partially do the
confined space to operate in.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Originality - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There has yet to be another
map created even remotely close to what Asylum has to offer. The
combination of prefabs, textures, lighting and sound, all help
to create an ambience which is very difficult to find in most
maps. There are a few minor problem areas, such as the spawning
in the cell when it is locked shut. Holy Goat as tells us, &quot;Room
27's door goes a little out of alignment when it opens, and a
few of the roof light textures are out of alignment.&quot; But
if you are not looking for these minor flaws you won't catch them.
The animated rain and interactive dart board are all items which
make Asylum a special map you don't play. But experience. &quot;And
remember: take your medicine and nurse won't have to strap you
in...&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">General Feel - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The test group never did get
to play this map in team play, but it may end up in a future LAN
rotation. I am not really sure how I overlooked this map when
it came to play Action Quake. I guess as they say, &quot;better
late, then never.&quot; If you have not played this map, then
by all means head to a local ftp and download it. This map is
something special, which Holy Goat has recreated and it is called
Quakeham Asylum. If you are insane or going crazy, then you will
be welcomed here.</FONT></P>
