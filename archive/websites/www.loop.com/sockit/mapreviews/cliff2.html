<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Layout - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The layout of cliff2 is great.
There is access to multiple levels throughout the entire map.
The lack of viable object to take cover from is lacking. The are
so many different lines-of-sight, you do not know where that next
bullet is going to strike from. This maps has a few interesting
concept. There is a cable car which moves back and forth through
the canyon. The map also has a unique feature when you decide
to take a swim in the water, a waterfall. Very well done. Overall,
the map plays very well The cable houses are the few places which
provide adequate cover when seeking shelter to bandage or regroup.
Even inside, you are not truly safe as there is access in from
the roof of the cable house.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Textures &amp; Sky - Score
8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The background is very simple
and adds to the enjoyment of the map. It is a basic blue sky thinly
scattered clouds, with a desert/mountain setting finished in different
tones of brown. The textures on the map itself are a combination
of browns to simulate dirt and rock. The cable houses and car
are set in grays. When in the waterfall, your vision is a bit
blurry, due to the effect of water flowing down the falls. Nice
touch!</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Prefabs - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The cable car is unique and
was a great addition to this map. Although it seems a bit under
used because it does not provide much in the way of protection
when riding it.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sounds - Score 3</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There are no sounds in cliff2,
but there should have been. Mechanical sounds from the cable car
and the sound of falling water would have been a nice addition.
This would have definitely added to the ambience of the overall
map.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lighting - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There are simulated shadows
used through the entire canyon. This helps to set a &quot;high
noon&quot; type of atmosphere. There were even shadows added to
the floor of the canyon from the cable houses and cable car.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Playability - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">All the files unzip into the
proper directories. Cliff2 is a good example of keeping r_speeds
to a minimum. Overall, the map runs between 300-500. There are
no areas, even when on the extreme ends of the map speeds were
very stable at 500-600.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Teamplay - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This is an excellent teamplay
map. At the start of a new round most teams take off running for
control of the high ground, which dominates the map. Hold this
ground and you will control the overall flow of the map. Getting
there is the simple part. Once to the summit, you are usually
met by the opposition and a blaze of bullets. This seems to be
a major kill zone. If you happen to get stuck on the floor of
the canyon, it becomes very difficult to make your way to the
high portion of the map. The floor also provides very little in
the way of protection. If you happen to make your way to the waterfall,
you must keep a constant eye on your six, as someone may attempt
a kill from behind. Players usually us the machinegun and MP4
to spread a barrage of bullets over a large area. Snipers, although
lacking a true sniping area, become very dangerous as they can
kill from a very far distant, as the line-of-sight is usually
unobstructed, such as above the cable houses.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">DM - Score</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">N/A</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Originality - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Now here is a very original
idea, based on a canyon setting with a cable car, which operates
over the canyon. One of most well designed outside maps to date.
Nothing I have played compares to cliff and cliff2. The looks
are a bit deceiving, but this is a very big map. But unlike the
big city maps, you can usually see the opposition somewhere in
the canyon, which means they can see you and there is a chance
to take a bullet.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">General Feel - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Although cliff2 is not a favorite
of mine, it is a great looking map. The flow of the game is very
quick paced, as a majority of the killing seems to happen after
the word &quot;Action&quot; is said. You do get the feeling of
being in a canyon, as any wrong step will make you fall to your
death. Unlike the original map, the water will provide a safe
landing in a few areas. If you enjoy the teamplay, check this
map out and grab it.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Final Rating - Score 7 (63/9)</FONT></B>
