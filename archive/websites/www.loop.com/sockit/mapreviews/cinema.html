<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lights! Camera! Cinema! Let's
go check out tonight's feature, but don't expect to see Siskel
and Ebert standing next to you toting a sniper rifle. The layout
consists of a multi level building housing a movie theater. Downstairs
is a small ticket counter, with access outside into a small street
area. There is a trailer which is parked in front of the theater,
providing for a bit of cover. Following the staircase leads you
to the second floor. Upstairs there is a small &quot;Out of Order&quot;
restroom and two entrances into the theater. Its a good layout,
but like most maps, there is only one way in and one way out,
making the map feel a bit awkward.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Textures &amp; Sky - Score
8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The author worked the overall
color scheme into the theater well. The entire cinema is finished
in different shades of red, from the carpet to the walls and even
the scene on the movie screen. The textures are very well done,
but it all seems to run together. It would have been just fine
if, there was some ambient lighting to help to differentiate between
the reds. But it does not, and it stay very dark through the entire
map.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Prefabs - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There are a few prefabs which
help to accent the overall feeling of the cinema. There is a small
circular ticket counter, complete with computer. The restroom
is complemented with broken toilets and a sink. While the theater
has what most have, rows of seats, finished in a red tone.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sounds - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As you pass from the lobby into
the theater, you can hear film spooling, as if a movie was actually
playing. That is the extent of sounds used in cinema. It seems
that a music score or some movie type sound could have been used
inside the movie theater to help out the ambience.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lighting - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As most theaters are dark, so
is this map. There are areas in which there is no light to cast
any sort of outline of a figure, which could play into the hands
of a sniper. There are lights, but they seem to be on the walls,
with the light shining upwards, onto the walls. This works fine
for the lobby area and the outside of the theater. But downstairs
in the lobby, there is virtually no light at all, except the glare
from outside and the glass windows on the far wall. This is inevitably
where the heaviest action takes place.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Playability - Score 4</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">All the files unzip correctly.
As for r_speeds, this is an example of what you do not want r_speeds
to look like. The speeds on this map easily average 1000. If you
are standing outside of the lobby of the theater, near the trailer
or inside near the staircase, r_speeds climb to just over 1900!
As you make your way up the stairs speeds seem to decrease to
400-500, but jump back up over 1000 after reach the top floor.
While in the theater, the speeds tended to stay below 1000.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Teamplay - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If you decide to stay on a small
scale team match, this map will fit in well. But get 8 vs. 8 and
the cinema gets very small. The main action will take place between
the two floors on the staircase. This is similar to the layout
on airport, where the teams fight on two different levels for
control of the map. One team will respawn in the back of the trailer,
while the other team starts upstairs.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">DM - Score</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">N/A</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Originality - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Holy Goat made the idea work
well on his map. I just wish there was a back exit, from the theater
back down to the street. With only one way in and one way out,
the map does not flow smoothly at all times. This is one of those
maps in which shotguns and hand cannons have the advantage for
the close in fire fights. Although if you just cannot give up
your sniper rifle, find that darkened corner and wait for the
unsuspecting to walk through your site. And where is the concession
stand? I need my hot buttered popcorn and soda before the movie
begins.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">General Feel - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Give cinema by Holy Goat &quot;two
thumbs up&quot; for originality! But &quot;two thumbs down&quot;
on the size and the overall flow of the map. This map, as I mentioned
above plays similar to airport by Schmung, but on a smaller scale.
All the action usually occurs in and around the staircase, until
one team decides to rush the stairs and the other team.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Final Rating - Score 6.3
(57/9)</FONT></B>
