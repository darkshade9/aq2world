<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Layout - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">What sets each city map apart?
Is it the author? The layout? Textures, maybe? Of course all of
these play into it, this city layout is no different. This layout
is built upon a square city block, with a brick wall surrounding
the city. There are many different elevation changes throughout
the entire map, making for some interesting lines of sight. Most
all of the buildings allow you access to a few rooms inside and
onto the rooftops. You are also able to navigate the entire city
block without ever setting foot on the ground. The park area and
layout is great, a nice addition to a city map.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Textures &amp; Sky - Score
8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There are some excellent looking
textures used throughout the entire map. That is a big plus, but
the drawback is the extremely high r_speed associated with these
beautiful textures. There is a nice variety of textures used on
the buildings, from red brick and gray concrete to glass buildings
and white marble. It creates a good looking map. The sky also
aids in the overall ambience. It is a grayish, partly cloudy skies,
with areas of blue peaking through.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Prefabs - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The map has some great prefabs
used. The trees and street lamps look great. While in the 'Smoking
Area', there are picnic tables to relax at. The building which
has the sign, 'Planet X', has a few tables scattered downstairs,
which are not in the flow of traffic, but seem to get in the way.
As you make your way upstairs in the club, there is a DJ's booth,
complete with turntables. You will also find a few tables in some
of the buildings and a few crates stacked down one of the alleyways.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sounds - Score 5</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">While in Planet X, jam to your
favorite tune while fragging the enemy. This is the only area
which has any sound and fits the setting, since you are in a club.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lighting - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The street lamps look really
good and give way to a cascade of light which disperses onto the
ground below. This effect is used throughout the entire map on
the street level. All of the buildings have some sort of interior
lighting, be it a white or colored looks great, given the grayish
setting the city is shadowed in. 'Planet X' has a multi-colored
flashing disco light upstairs you must check out.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Playability - Score 4</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Extremely high r_speeds recorded
on half of the map! I recorded upwards of 2100 in a few areas,
usually found near the park area near 'Planet X'. This portion
of the map averages at least 1500. The other portions of the map
were also fairly high, with some areas having lower (200-500)
speeds, but this definitely cause a bit of lag when I was in teamplay,
online via DSL. The files are named correctly and unzip nicely
into their correct folders.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Teamplay - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Another solid teamplay map for
10 to 12 players. There was ample space to move around in. With
all the different elevations changes, players could be found anywhere
on this map. Most of the action seemed to center around the open
park area. Snipers setup camp in the building directly across
from 'Planet X' and began their killing spree. Other players took
advantage of the higher elevations and attempted to attack those
players on the street level. There are many different objects
to act as cover when on the ground, from open doorways, to trees
and lampposts and even covers of the buildings. It made for a
great rounds of fighting.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">DM - Score</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">N/A</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Originality - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Yes, this is another city, but
it definitely has a different feel to it then say the urban or
actcity series. This all goes back to the layout and structure
of the map, this is a standard 'city block' but was created so
you could enter a majority of the buildings on the map. The only
area which detracted from the map is the r_speeds.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">General Feel - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Yes, it is another city map,
but like its predecessors, it has a completely different feel
to it. With the exception of a map series, such as Urban or Actcity,
each city map is unique in its own ways. Downtown is no different.
The map flows well and plays fast while looking great, but map
be difficult to find on many servers due to the r_speeds. It is
a modest download at 1.06mb. But if you play on a LAN, get ready
to rock! This map is a blast!</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Final Rating - Score 6.5
(59/9)</FONT></B>
