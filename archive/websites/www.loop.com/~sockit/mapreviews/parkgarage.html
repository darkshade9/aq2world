<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Ever seen those action movies
where the hero runs through the parking garage, guns blazing after
the bad guy? Well, now it is your turn and hopefully you are on
the correct end of that barrel. This is a straight forward map,
it is a simple rectangular layout of a multi-level parking garage.
Complete with five stories, two stairwells and an elevator. This
layout is simple, but maybe too simple. There are some very good
lines of fire, but considering the area, not much stands in the
way of a bullet. Watch your every move in here. The stairwells
seem to provide a great amount of coverage, as there is non-breakable
glass from the ground up to the top level. Gaining access to each
level can be accomplished by either stairwell, located in adjacent
corners, an express elevator, with service to the rooftop, or
take the long route and your life into your hands and venture
up the driveways leading to and from the next level.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Textures &amp; Sky - Score
6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The gray of cement and concrete
dominate most of the maps textured areas, giving off that cold
and rough feel enclosed areas like this are prone to do. Standing
outside there are some nice looking streets and sidewalks, complete
with painted lines, for all those non-existent automobiles. The
orangish-red sky looks great (maybe it is my video cards), and
really help set the overall ambience for this maps. It is a strong
contrast the the grays of the structure.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Prefabs - Score 4</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Any sort of prefab in this map
would surely have added to this rather empty feeling map. All
is not lost, there is one storage room on the ground floor which
has boxes. Unfortunately, they don't server much of a purpose
for anything. Some random automobiles, scattered throughout some
of the different levels would most definitely helped this layout.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sounds - Score</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">N/A</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lighting - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As you step into this map, there
is a definite feel of dusk falling upon the parking garage. Ample
lighting illuminates most all of the levels in the garage itself.
There are a few expections, and this goes for each and every floor.
There are darkened areas on each floor of the parking structure.
The roof is probably the darkest of the five level structure.
The light posts give off a cascade of light, which falls in a
circular pattern on the ground.With little to hid behind, you
could be a sitting duck. Stay low and out of the light.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Playability - Score 3</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">ARRGH! Is makes you wonder,
how this was not caught before it was released to AQMD. I would
have to say, this is a good example of what NOT to have r_speeds
look like. Average r_speeds throughout this map range from 100s
to 3000+, when standing outside looking from one corner of the
map to the other. This makes most maps over the internet very
laggy and difficult to play. Even when you are inside the structure,
the r_speeds are averaging 1200-1600. Unacceptable by todays mapping
standards. This map did play, without lag over a LAN. The files
unzip correctly and are appropriately named.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Teamplay - Score 5</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">We managed to get a few rounds
of teamplay in on parkgarage before changing maps. Overall, most
enjoyed the TP aspect on it, but there were a few who did not
like it at all. Most of the complaints were about the lack of
objects to provide for cover when taking fire. The rounds also
went rather fast. Snipers scored big, as they would lurk in the
darkness on the roof and pick off would be attackers as they emerged
from the elevator or the access ramp leading down to the previous
level. Most favored the assault rifle or the machine gun.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">DM - Score</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">N/A</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Originality - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I do like the idea, but it should
have been carried a bit further. It seems to me, this maps may
have been released before the mapping &quot;standards&quot; and
guidelines were set. I do like the layout, but there could have
been some work to create a different surround then the Strogg
desert. A cityscape would have helped to create a desired effect.
After numerous rounds, this does become a monotonous map in teamplay.
DM possibilities? Maybe. Just need to create a few more areas
and obstacles for the players to run through and around.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">General Feel - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This map used to have a home
in your LAN rotation, but was soon replaced by maps which provided
more action throughout the maps' entirety. With a bit of work,
this map could give action fans another unique structure to play
in. But until r_speeds are greatly reduced and some prefabs, or
something to be used as cover is added, this map may just collect
dust in your map file. It is worth checking out, just to keep
from making the same mistakes.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Final Rating - Score 5.3
(42/8)</FONT></B>
