<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Layout - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This is your typical city map,
built within a city block. There are buildings around the edge
of the map and a small inaccessible building in the center, connected
by a covered walkway. Most of the buildings allow roof access,
but only three of the buildings have interior rooms. There does
seem to be some difficulty getting down to the street level from
some of the buildings. A jump is required, onto the brick building
with the 'Coke' sign, so you can make your way down the building
under construction. The line of fire provides unlimited gaming
action for both snipers and shotgun or MP4/machinegun players.
The sniper could be at an advantage if holed up in the building
where the sniper rounds regenerate, as it is tough to get a kill
when the wall provides cover. After all, there is only one way
in and out. This map is well balanced allowing for manageable
game play. Weapon layout is scattered throughout the city, making
it well balanced.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Textures &amp; Sky - Score
6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The alignment of the background
cityscape adds a touch of color to the otherwise brown, bland
map. If there were additional stars in the sky, this too could
have given urban a more dusk or early evening feeling. Overall,
the theme of the map works, there are no areas or building which
seem inconsistent within this city block.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Prefabs - Score 5</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There is nothing overly spectacular
about urban. Gerbil! did take the time to use a few different
prefab ladders, electrical units and a Coke sign on the buildings,
giving a bit of randomness to the map. This map does not require
the use of many prefabs, as they would only hinder gameplay.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sounds - Score</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">N/A. There was no use of sounds,
unless you want to consider all the times a player attempts the
jump over to the brick building with the 'Coke' sign on top. If
you misjudge, there is a yell, followed by a splat. Outside of
that, this is a quiet map. I do think some sound would have been
out of place if used.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lighting - Score 5</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There are not really any dark
areas on the map, but the author did use lighting on both the
streets and on the corridor for effect. Looks a bit false shinning
on the streets, maybe because I don't think it is dark enough,
but it does help out this map.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Playability - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">By no means is Urban the &quot;perfect&quot;
map when it comes to r_speeds. This map abuses the rules and exceeds
1200 in a few spots on the taller buildings when looking across
the map. On average, speeds fluctuated from 300-700. Some of the
alleyways, rooms and stairwells revealed somewhat lower speeds.
There is also clipping when you are stadning on the tall building,
facing the Action Quake sign, this can cause problems finding
your enemy. All files are zipped correctly.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Teamplay - Score 9</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I find this map to be an excellent
map to play and have experienced both teamplay and DM on urban.
There are a few areas which snipers seem to covet, like the shielded
area near the parking garage, accessed by jumping over to the
grey building. Also for those who dare to access the roof of the
parking garage, BEWARE. This can become a prime location to be
picked off from. I know, because I love this spot. A note to the
sniper, if no one is covering your back, your opponent could easily
climb the building sneak up behind you. For those who like to
get into blaring gun fights, you are in luck. There is enough
area where you are usually covered from being shot at. There does
seem to be a problem respawn spot in teamplay. That being the
spot on top of the center building. There is only a single way
down, by jumping onto the roof of the walkway and dropping through
the hole in the roof. A door and some stairs leading into the
small enclosed room would have made for even better team action.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">DM - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I've only had limited game play
in DM, but the spread of weapons is not bad. It becomes fast paced
when you are without a special weapon. Usually resulting in ending
up on the wrong side of a weapon. On this map, limit the game
to no more then 8 players, or the fight for weapons become difficult.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Originality - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Still one of the most popular
and well designed maps around. Its simplicity makes it a map which
will stand the test of time. The map does have great play characteristics,
but there is potential for even a better urban map. This has been
accomplished in the follow up maps, urban2 and urban3. A few parked
cars or trucks would have helped for cover when running through
the empty streets.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">General Feel - Score 9</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Great gameplay and action all
the time on this map. Not too big for a few players, but large
enough for a good team match. Still a great map for all types
of players. This is worth the download, check it out!</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Final Rating 6.8 (62/9)</FONT></B>
