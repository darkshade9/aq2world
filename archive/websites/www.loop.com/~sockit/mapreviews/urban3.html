<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Layout - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This is the third version of
urban and it still feels and plays like a fresh map. If you have
played the previous versions, you will notice the same basic street
layout, resembling a 'U'. The placement of some building and objects,
such as ladders and fences which stay consistent through each
'new and improved' version. For example, the wooden fence and
the A framed roof at the end of the street. There is much more
roof access then before, so be ready to climb many ladders and
jump onto many ledges. The flow of the games does stay consistent,
like most maps of this kind it can be challenging to achieve that
final kill. For obvious reasons, this is a sniper paradise. Many
high roofs and areas of cover when drawing fire. The MP4 and machinegun
are also choice weapons when it comes to weapon selection.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Textures &amp; Sky - Score
6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Don't those same old building
textures get old? Why yes they do, especially on this map. Your
basic red brick and white/gray concrete make up 90% of the buildings.
The only exception, a non-accessible, white pane building, tallest
on the map. Gerbil!, we need some more variety in your textures
for your upcoming maps. The sky, when viewed from ground level
is clean. Another rendition of blue skies with white, wispy clouds.
Yawn. There does seem to be a problem when viewing buildings from
across the entire map. The build become intermittent, as pieces
disappear. Possibly the map is too big? I don't know, I don't
map. I does seem to be only in a few areas, on a few buildings.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Prefabs - Score 5</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Not much in the way of prefabs
a few pieces, such as a small table in some of the accessible
rooms. There are boxes, resembling air conditioning units placed
on most of the roofs. It does fit this city theme, even though
they are over used by most. Nothing new and original in urban3
to set it apart from the other two.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sounds - Score</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">N/A</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lighting - Score 5</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Not much, since it is daytime.
Although in the building pictured below, there is nice shadow
cast by the light shinning down through the hole in the roof.
But that is the extent of lighting effects.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Playability - Score 5</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This meap is the worst of the
series when it comes to overall r_speeds. When you find yourself
on the rooftops, you face two problems, extremely high r_speeds
and bad clipping. The action on the rooftops averages 1000 in
most areas. Some were even recorded high, while the r_speeds peaked
at 1750. While on the ground level, expect better speed, averaging
200-800. All files are zipped correctly in lowercase.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Teamplay - Score 9</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I am not sure what it is about
his maps, but I enjoy teamplay on the urban series. As we know
the city theme is old and reused, but it makes for good, solid
game of team Action. Another in which snipers thoroughly enjoy.
The map is extremely large and makes it difficult for a player
to see the far reaches of the other side, giving the advantage
to the sniper. There is a spot where a team spawns in a small
room on the roof (pictured above). This has caused members to
become stuck and easy targets for the other team. Also if you
do not get off this roof, chances are you will be killed by a
snipers bullet. Why? Because the other team spawn on building
directly across from this spot making it difficult to descend
off the roof if caught up there. Teamplay flows well on urban3</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">DM - Score</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">N/A</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Originality - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">What can you say? This is the
third urban map in the series? The concept is old, but the map
plays well, I guess there is where it makes up for being so unoriginal.
Do these city maps ever get old? Yes they do, if they are done
incorrectly (blood). This map, in my opinion is done right to
give you a &quot;new&quot; feeling to an old theme.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">General Feel - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If you enjoyed playing the other
two maps in the trilogy, then take the time to download this one.
There is nothing new he has added. You will get the same feeling
you had on the previous maps. Some of the buildings have been
reworked, as have the ladders. I guess I have something for city
maps, I like playing here, even though the score does not reflect
the playability of the map. Take it or leave it, nothing special
about the new urban3</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Final Rating - Score 6.3
(50/8)</FONT></B>
