<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Layout - Score 9</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There seems to be some big trouble
in little Tokyo and it all centers around you. Before you say,
&quot;What, another city block layout?&quot; just continue reading
and see if it is not very different then previous city blocks.
The city laid out in a box pattern with buildings around the edges
and a few buildings in the center, most with access to roof. There
are many windows and doors throughout the entire map, most of
which cannot be opened. The map flows great, no dead spots to
take away from the overall smoothness of this map.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Textures &amp; Sky - Score
9</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">My complements to Scuzzy on
the textures. These are some of the finest textures to date used
on an Action map I have seen. No ripping or tearing on any of
the textures all are smooth and make this an outstanding map to
look at. The only thing which did not work was the pizza parlor
logo and name on the windows which happened to come out backwards.
But that is a minor detail. Each street is also marked with a
street signs, nice added touch! The sky is a typical night sky,
with stars dotting the heavens, works well with to create a night
time atmosphere.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Prefabs - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The big rig parked in the street
is gorgeous! Excellent textures were used to create, right down
to the last detail. And it does not seem out of place, parked
on the street. You also have access into the trailer, which houses
a shotgun.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sounds - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The entire city seems alive
with sound, depending on which portion of the map you are standing
in. There are the sounds of clanking of machinery, the humming
of an electric current and even flies. They are subtle enough
and placed just right that it complements the city very well.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lighting - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The use of lighting aids in
creating the atmosphere for the entire map. Street lights flicker,
windows are lit up from the inside and shadows are cast on rooftops
and streets. The map is not overly dark, as you can usually make
out your adversary from anywhere on the map. The shadows which
are cast give the sensation of a full moon shinning brightly on
a clear night.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Playability - Score</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">N/A. Another map played on a
LAN system, so I have no information on r_speeds, lag or stability.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Teamplay - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The map rocked for teamplay!
Even at 8 vs. 8, there was a considerable amount of room for running
and gunning your enemy. There was no real advantage to hole up
anywhere and dominate the map. There is a second story room with
a few windows which provide ample cover when under attack. There
were many battles which came down to the final 2 players and inevitably
one was on the roof and the other the street level. Giving the
advantage to the player on the roof. Overall, it was a well balanced
teamplay map. Intense fight fires on the street level and long,
sniping kills from high rooftops. Although not obvious at first,
there are no ladders to climb to the rooftops. You must shimmy
up the metal gutter pipes on the sides of the buildings to gain
a birds eye view of the city and hopefully your opponent.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">DM - Score</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">N/A</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Originality - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The idea is very unoriginal,
but the thought and time put into this map puts tokyo on the way
to becoming an instant classic! The flow of the map is excellent.
I do wish there were a few more doors you could open to provide
cover when on the ground or to access a second floor. By no means
does this detract from the map of the gameplay. This map can be
compared to urban, but consider it taken to a new and higher level.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">General Feel - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I do believe this map deserves
to be in any map rotation. The are very few flaws in this map
from layout, to ambience, to gameplay. If you like the city maps,
download and check it out. It comes highly recommended! Even just
downloading it to check out the textures would be worth your time.
This is how a map should be constructed. It has a bit of everything
in it for the Action player out there.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Final Rating - Score 8.0
(64/8)</FONT></B>
