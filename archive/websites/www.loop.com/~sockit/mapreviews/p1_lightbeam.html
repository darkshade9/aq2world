<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I will let the author describe
the layout of his map, &quot;A map for AQ2, with a lighthouse
(or suitably large tribute to female independence, take it as
you wish), some offices, a car park, some water, a few rocks,
a few roofs, a warehouse...oh and a caravan. Basically a good,
compact, harbor-ish style romp with enough variation in it to
keep most people happy.&quot; Thanks for the quick introduction
to Lightbeam, interestingly enough, this was released around the
time of the other lighthouse map. I do enjoy the layout used to
create this map, makes great game play and a nice flow pattern.
The building can be enter numerous ways, such one of three doors
or climbing the pipe which leads onto the roof. This makes for
multiple routes which can be taken when going on the offensive.
It also provides for different escape routes. Once inside, you
are able to crawl through the ventilation system which leads from
one of the offices to the warehouse and from the hallway to the
roof. The lighthouse is constructed with a spiraling staircase,
followed by a ladder's climb to the observation deck. A great
location for those intending to snipe. The only challenging part
is, keeping yourself shielded from being attack by players on
the rooftops or the ground.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Textures &amp; Sky - Score
7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I have mixed feelings when it
comes to the textures which were used. Most of these textures
are credited as new, such as the sky rendering and numerous textures
used thought the map. Unfortunately, when you are outside of the
building, it feels like you are playing Quake, as the textures
seem to be dark and drab. The interior textures are the complete
opposite. These textures are crisp, clean and vivid in color.
The wooden floor,coupled with the pinkish-brown walls in the hallway
are great looking. The offices looking amazing, one with two toned
wood paneling and a the office a run down looking computer room.
The courtyard is a bit plain, as it is mostly finished in shades
of gray. The caravan would have looked much better if it were
finished in something other then brown. The warehouse follows
a similar pattern as the rest of the map, but the textures seem
to be a bit brighter, this is held out by the lighting. The sky
is fitting for the map, set with a darkened blue sky with a few
clouds, stars and a full moon shining down.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Prefabs - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This map has some of the best
looking computers I have seen on an Action Quake map to date.
This combined with the detailed metal desks and file cabinets,
help to provide some great looking furnishings. The courtyard
and warehouse are full of wooden crates, which not only act as
protection from bullets, but do provide an intermediate level
to jump on to access other portions of the map.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sounds - Score 9</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The map comes alive with sound,
a plus especially in this one. While in and around the small pool
of water, you can hear the sound of gurgling of water (sounds
like it was from Duke 3D) to go along with the splashing water.
When you find yourself on the rooftops, the howling of wind can
be heard, making it more difficult to hear approaching footsteps
from down below. The most unique sound comes as you approach the
apex of the lighthouse. To go along with the howling wind, is
the squawking of seagulls high above. As you enter the building,
the crackle of a burnt out light can be be heard walking through
the hallway.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lighting - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The best lighting technique
used in the maps is the dimming and brightening of the filament,
for the top of the lighthouse. It is much more noticeable when
you are standing on the rooftops as opposed to actually standing
up on the lighthouse observation deck. The interior hallways are
all well lit by lights hanging from the fixtures down the center
of ceiling. A few broken lights flicker as you walk down the hallways.
Most of the outside are dark, this is especially true when you
enter the courtyard. It has a pitch back, recessed area along
with darkened caravan to &quot;camp&quot; in.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Playability - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I encountered one minor problem
when unzipping the files. The seagull.wav file unzips into the
sound directory, but it should be located in a 'ppp folder' inside
that directory. Aside form that, the remaining files found their
ways to the intended directories. Here is yet another prime example
of outstanding r_speeds. Nowhere on this map do the speeds exceed
800. On one corner I reproduced a 798, and that is where is maxed
out at. The majority of the map is played in the 300-700 range.
Inside, r_speeds were great as well, usually a bit on the lower
side, due to the smaller areas, which need to be drawn. This map
plays great over the internet.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Teamplay - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">For a map of this size, I was
kind of surprised where a majority of the action took place. More
often then not, teams matched firepower in the narrow, winding
hallways as opposed to outside. Teams would usually enter the
hallways from opposite ends and meet somewhere in the middle.
The offices provided a welcomed relief, to reload and bandage.
On occasion, players would drop into the office through rooftop.
The roof also had a good amount of gameplay, since it was possible
to hold down a portion of the roof, which would provide adequate
cover when taking fire. At the top of the lighthouse, you could
usually find a sniper, most everyone knew that. But it was difficult
for the sniper to be completely out of view. There was always
somewhere on the roof you could spot the sniper before they had
a chance to chamber a round and fire. Rounds were fairly quick,
even at six players per side. The flow pattern was very smooth
for both teams, this coupled with good respawn spot made for enjoyable
rounds.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">DM - Score</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">N/A</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Originality - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Although I never find a date
as to when this map was created, I believe it was released almost
immediately after [20ID]God Incarnate's Lighthouse. The only similarity
in the two maps are the tall standing lighthouses, the maps both
play completely different. I did like some of the areas included
in p1_lightbeam. The warehouse is interesting, but I am a bit
discouraged that the large metal doors do not open to the outside.
Also, it would have been nice to see the large crane move the
crate. Enter into the courtyard and head over to what the Brits
call a &quot;caravan&quot;, we in the States know it as a camper.
When you open the caravan and enter, a message pops up, &quot;A
caravan, great for camping holidays,&quot; in more ways then one.
p1_lighthouse is a unique idea, which was laid out beautifully.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">General Feel - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Due to supporting factors, this
map should be up and running on more servers then it currently
is. The layout, r_speeds and sounds really bring this map into
its own. I was left with a somewhat sour taste in my mouth, when
it comes to textures. It does have some good ones, but it just
missing something to really make it stand out. You will have a
good, solid rounds and many frags. Give it a chance and draw your
own conclusions.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Final Rating - Score 7.4
(67/9)</FONT></B>
