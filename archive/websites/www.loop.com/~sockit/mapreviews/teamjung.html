<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It's time to go &quot;teamin'
in the jungle&quot;, be ready for anything. This is a long and
winding canyon map, shaped similar to the letter &quot;S&quot;.
There are cliffs and grassy hills hugging the canyon walls, making
for some great elevation changes. There are many ways to make
you way to the other side of the map. Be ready to use the trees
and crates to protect you from stray bullets and to change elevation.
The floor of the map seems to have most of the action when gameplay
starts. With very few objects on the map layout, the lines of
fire are very clear. I do feel as if the gameplay is a bit unbalanced,
as most of the fighting takes place on the ground, near the center
of the map.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Textures &amp; Sky - Score
5</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Basic and simple textures used
throughout the entire map help to make a good looking map. At
the time this map was created, there was a new texture introduced
(if you know which one, email me). Browns and green dominate,
while the wood texture of the crates helps to break these colors
up. The author notes, &quot;You'll also notice that the grass
textures are 3x bigger. This will help frame rate on non-3dcard
machines.&quot; Suislide helped out, to create the blue sky you
see used.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Prefabs - Score 4</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This map is full of wooden crates
which are multifunctional. Almost anywhere you walk on the map,
you will see crates strewn about or stacks of crates. Some of
the stacks will provide access to higher areas of the map, while
also aiding in cover when taking fire from the opposing team.
Since this is a jungle, there should be more trees. But the trees
that are growing throughout the map, which like the crates provide
cover and access to higher levels on the map. Unfortunately, I
did happen to stumble upon a dead area located under one of the
sniper rifles. I was attempting to access the higher portions
of the map when I jumped and missed the tree. I fell and was wedged
between the tree and the walls of the map. There was no way out
except waiting for the enemy or killing yourself.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sounds - Score</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">N/A</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lighting - Score 5</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Not much in the way of lighting.
You get the feeling of a bright afternoon, as most shadows are
limited on the map. Most are found underneath trees or cascading
off the sides of the hills and sides of the map. Gives off a nice
effect. Also, it looks like there is an unwanted lighting effect
on the stacks of crates. You will notice an reddish tint coming
from one of the big base crates. Although this does not affect
the game, it does look a bit unnatural and out of place.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Playability - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Here is another example of great
r_speeds. Overall, teamjungle averages between 300-600 on r_speeds.
If you happen to stand in one of the corners, you will get speeds
in excess of 1000. This one area will not detract from the overall
gameplay.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Teamplay - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Talk about fast, unbridled gameplay,
you got it with teamjungle! This maps easily provides action for
10-12 players, comfortably. Teams spawn at both ends of the map
make their way to the middle, on all different levels with guns
blazing. Snipers tend to hang back and stay low to provide cover
fire on the unsuspecting enemy. Be very careful and DON'T STAND
STILL because you will definitely pay with your life. If you don't
see the enemy in front you, they are probably above you on the
hilltops, which also pose a hazard to your health. It is possible
to snipe on this map, make sure you stay low and watch your back.
There are usually more then one way to get where you are and if
you are not careful, you will find yourself dead. This map is
very wide open and most players had success with the MP4 and MP5/10.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">N/A</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Originality - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I wish we would see more maps
along this simple style. With all the maps taking place inside
buildings and on city streets, this map is a welcome change to
a map rotation. I have also noticed this map running on many servers.
This map feels like some of the other outdoor maps like the Cliff
series and the recently released, deep canyon. Although I don't
think we will see it, an updated version of this map would be
a hit. With computer systems becoming faster and graphics improving,
the author could add more &quot;effects&quot; to create the desired
effect we are all looking for. Don't get me wrong, this is a nice
change from the &quot;city fraggin&quot; which is all too common.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">General Feel - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As the author himself says,
&quot;I am NOT happy about this map&quot;, but it is a fun map
to play. There are areas which could use some improvement to help
make this a better map. The river Timm had thought of using would
have been great, &quot;but it made the game too slow.&quot; Is
this a map who's time has come and went? You decide. It is fun
to play, even if it is lacking todays map standards. &quot;I decided
not to include any fancy stuff, as I wanted to keep the r_speeds
low (too bad I didn't do too well)&quot;, Timm says. Take that
for what it is worth and download this 736k file for some fast
paced action.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Final Rating - Score 5.3
(45/8)</FONT></B>
