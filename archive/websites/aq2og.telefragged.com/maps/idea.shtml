<p>Idea: I have had an idea for a map for a while and have been trying to get somebody to make it.  I work for Disney as a sound engineer and a stage technician, and work at Disneyland a lot.  I spent a month inside the 'It's a Small World' attraction(thankfully sans music, it was after hours) hanging Xmas decorations.  That building would be the perfect place for a paintball war or even better, a deathmatch map.  It's a huge square building sectioned off into the separate 'continent' rooms.  And there is a huge catwalk system 40' over head that we repeled from to hang the decorations.  The are is also a few tunnels under the flume(holds the water).  I have acess to some of the bluprints and can furnish some photos for referance.  Also, if you have any idea how to make prefabs, I can help there as well if it involves 3dsmax.  As the lead player modeler for AHL I can do a request of yours.

<p>Idea: i think the best map would be a freeway with cars goin by. there could be freeway signs that u could climb and trees on both sides.  each team could spawn on opposite sides, in trenches and go from there.  to make it so the other team couldn't rush so fast, there could be alot of cars goin.

<p>Idea: how about a map like in the movie Robin Hood:Prince of Theives where you can open up hidden little bunkers underground and climb up trees and walk across ropes from tree to tree.

<p>Idea: With all the city maps out there I figure someone would have thought of this 
sooner. I think that someone should put a bus going around the map. The would be soo cool.
Fragging people from the drivers seat. Or even distracting your opponent so the bus drives
over him without him noticing it.

<p>Idea: How about a WWF [or WcW (added by Shingy)] type scenario with the dressing rooms
and the parking area along with the big screen t.v. and a little outside area for all those
hardcore fans out there :)

<p>Idea: i think a great idea for a map would be an old runed down battle field.  it could
have broken down tanks, little block walls, some dead bodies, and little bases where the
armies stayed in.

<p>Idea: a big prison whit big walls around it whit guntowers and you can walk on the big
walls and it should be only one door out from the prisonwalls.

<p>Idea: What about a forrest with a lot of trees, bushes and maybe a hut in the forrest.
I think that could be cool.

<p>Idea: I think the best idea for a map would be a baseball stadium, indoor or outdoor. 
it be cool if you could go on the field and in the dugouts and stuff.  You could also go
up to the lights and snipe guys. It would be the best if somone could make it.

<br>From: <a href="mailto:Qborg@primenet.com">DayJive311</a>
<p>Idea: I always though there should be a realistic airport -- complete with a boardable
plane, a kitchen behind the resaraunt, a small parking garage, a moving sidewalk, and a
tunnel that leads all the way from baggae check in to the planes cargo hold, and then back
to the baggage claim...  these are basic ideas that i think would make for one of the best
AQ amps one could ever put their name on.  And because of the nature of the structure, it
wouldn't need to be gigantic or even large, you could fit all thses things is a small 
amount of area.  That is my suggestion for an AQ2 map...     thx

<p>Idea: A great idea for a map would be a golf course.  it wouldn't have to have 18 holes
but it could have the sport shop and like 3 or 4 holes. It could also have a driving range
with golf carts all over. Somone make that map!

<p>Idea: i think a good teamplay specific map base-like map would be a
map with the White House on one side of a street, a Court House on the
other side, and on a corner would be a Monica Lewinsky prefab =D&nbsp;

<p>Idea: How bout a WWF wrestling Stadium that would kick serious ass.
like have the locker rooms, ring, stadium seats, control booth, parking
garage, snack stands, and the usual main stadium features. you can have
like the turnbuckles climbable like ladders you can go under the ring,
and all that junk. and best of all have lots of guns and ammo.&nbsp;

<p>Idea: Why not make a valley? It could be a river in the middle and,
two high cliffs on each side. Maybe a wall that could be cover until you
reached the top of the cliff. Cool with teamplay !!! Not too dark !!&nbsp;

<p>Idea: A chemical drug plant. For teamplay: one team is the badasses
and the other the police/swat/army that comes to try to clean up the place.
Plant should have: halls where chemicals are mixed (some toxid waste on
floor, that makes you scream when you step into it and gives away your
position;), storage, transport area with a couple of vans. High up in the
factory area are some offices, giving a look over the hall. And outside
there are some police/army vehicles: this is the starting point of the
police/swat/army team. See a couple of movies to get the picture right
(though I can olnly come up with robocop (1 or 2?) at the moment)...&nbsp;

<p>Idea: Why hasn't anyone made a big-ass Bank yet? I would think that
that would be the most obvious choice for an Action map. base it on the
bank in "Killing Zoe". Call it "The Heist".&nbsp;

Yankee Stadium. (Guess where I'm from.) Or a supermarket just so people

<p>Idea: you should make a map with a woodlands theam and have like tree
houses and walkways and bridges and laders and caves and shit like that
and you should make 2 diffrent woodland's cammo skins to go with the map
so you can have teamplay&nbsp;

<p>Idea: A Disco Club that would have an entrance with the sniper rifle,
With a whole lotta prefab cars (cars to hide behind) and a bar plus animated
texture dance floor (man this level would fit witht the velvet jones model)
hehehehe

<p>Idea: wouldn't it be cool to fight it out in a store? maybe a food store
or a computer store? or how about a fitness center with all kinda of crazy
things like a swimming pool or a sauna (pardon the spelling, i think...)
or a highway type of deal. just along map of highway with cars all over
it and rest stops and truck stops and gas stations. how about a forest
or somehting like that. tons of trees, maybe a lake.&nbsp;

<p>From: <a href="mailto:snorc@northlink.net">Shane Norcross</a>
<p>Idea: I have had an idea for a Action map for a long time and because
I have never learned how to make maps for Quake 2, I could never make it
a reality. Basically its based on a Hockey Arena. It is very detailed with
alot of hidden areas and ambush points. May be better for DM than Teamplay
but I think it would still work. I have it drawn out and would be willing
to mail it to anyone who wants to try to tackle it. All I ask is for a
credit on the design of the map. Thanks.
