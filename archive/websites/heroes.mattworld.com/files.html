<h1>Server Files</h1>
<p>These files are only necessary for the server! The client doesn't need any 
  files at all.</p>
<p><a href="gamex86.dll">gamex86.dll</a> - Set teamplay to 1. You can set the 
  hero's weapon at any time in the console with "heroweapon x" where x is mp5, 
  m4, m3, knife, dual, sniper, or hc.</p>
<p><a href="jungle1.hro">jungle1.hro</a> - This is 
  a sample scene file. When you first load a map, it will look for a file with 
  the name of the map with hro extension. So jungle1 would look for jungle1.hro, 
  etc. In that file, you can set the team names, skins, and the hero's weapon.</p>
<p>Any questions, feel free to contact me.</p>
