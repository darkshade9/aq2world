<h1>How to Play Heroes</h1>
<p>Heroes is a new way to play Action. While it is based off of teamplay code, 
  it's not really a team oriented mod. There are many features from teamplay, 
  like the two teams, but it is every man for himself.</p>
<h2>The Hero</h2>
<p>Team 1 consists of one player, the Hero. Players take turns being the Hero. 
  The Hero starts the round with his Hero Weapon, which is decided by the serverop. 
  The Hero doesn't follow the normal Action rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Hero doesn't lose health from fallling damage.</li>
  <li>The Hero has unlimited ammo with his Hero Weapon.</li>
  <li>The Hero can't pick up weapons or items.</li>
  <li>The Hero doesn't lose health from damage from enemies.</li>
  <li>The Hero doesn't get frags for killing his enemies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Villains</h2>
<p>Team 2 is the Villains. Villains follow all the normal Action rules. They start 
  the round with whatever weapon the player chose in the menus. They can't kill 
  the Hero, but they get points for damaging him. Everytime a Villain accumulates 
  100 damage points against the Hero, he receives a frag. Damage tallies are kept 
  through rounds. A Villain receives full credit for a shot on the hero, even 
  if it results in more than 1 frag.</p>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>The object of the game is to accumulate the most frags, by inflicting damage 
  on others when they are the hero, and by not allowing damage on you when you 
  are the hero. Inflicting damage on Heroes requires mostly the same skills as 
  Action, and the realization that the Hero will return fire no matter what. It's 
  not possible to merely hit first and kill him. Being the Hero requires different 
  skills. You can elude your attackers by doing things they can't, like jumping 
  off buildings. You can be more liberal with ammo, and you'll need to be, with 
  so many attackers. Be careful, though; you still need to reload. Winning the 
  game requires you to play both sides well.</p>
