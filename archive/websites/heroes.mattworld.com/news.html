<p>Due to some recent requests, I have made the source to Heroes available for download.  If anyone fixes any bugs, makes any changes, or compiles any ports, please let me know so I can post them here.

<p>Ok, I finally put the beta files up on the webpage. I haven't worked on them 
  in months, and there aren't any servers, but people keep asking for them. If 
  you want to run a server, contact me. I have a huge list of players for you.
