        Contrary to popular belief, I am still around, I've just been getting a lot of sleeping
        done recently (15+ hours a day) so other stuff tends to fall by the way. However, I have
        now finished my beginners guide to creating aliases and scripts in AQ2. This will help
        with a lot of basic and advice about what to do and how to fix problems, I hope it helps.
        Check it out <a HREF="http://www.aq2zone.com/aq2_alias.htm">here</a></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#0080c0">Work is
        coming on well with Black Monk and his 'Uberpack', containing every official AQ2 map. He
        and the <a HREF="http://aqmd.action-web.net/" target="_blank">AQ2 Map Depot</a> have
        agreed on what maps are official, something that was causing problems, and Windows testing
        has finished. All that remains is the Linux testing then it's ready to be released. Last
        time I checked, Monk was still looking for a Linux tester. If you're prepared to load 170
        or so maps and note down any problems, drop <a HREF="mailto:superproz@aol.com">Black Monk</a>
        a line to see if you can help</font><dl>
          <dt><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#0080c0">There's
            quite an important news post concerning <a HREF="http://ahl.action-web.net/"
            target="_blank">Action Half-Life</a>, basically in a few weeks all work on AHL will
            temporarily be put on hold while the A Team releases the first version of <a
            href="http://aut.action-web.net/">Action Unreal Tournament</a>. Then work will resume on
            AHL and it will have dives and stunts once again. Basically, Valve's Half Life 1.1.0.0
            patch caused a lot of problems for AHL and other mods, the A Team is planning that by the
            time they finish AUT Beta 1, Valve will have fixed a lot of the problems and work will
            resume on AHL once again</font></dt>
          <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
          <dt><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#0080c0">Also on the
            AHL front, recently the whole community has got itself in motion making things for AHL so
            they can survive the dark months when the A Team is working on AUT. People are modelling,
            mapping, skinning, making graphics, all kinds of wonderful things. Look out for new maps
            on the <a href="http://ahlmd.telefragged.com/">AHL Map Depot</a> in upcoming weeks, but
            the main place you'll notice activity is on <a href="http://www.heavenofrags.de/">Haven O'
            Frags</a>, the official source for AHL player models, weapon models, weapon skins and oh
            so many other things, much like the AQ2 Actor's Guild. Releases are being made daily of
            new models and graphics, I'm amazed at the work being done. Recently there has been a new
            modelpack full of excellent weapon models and I must single out LPlasma's
            recently-released&nbsp; incredible Desert Eagle model, I highly recommend you use it. I've
            even had a few things released myself, go look</dt>
        </dl>
        <p>Something I forgot to mention a while back, the first version of <a
        href="http://aq1.telefragged.com/">Action Quake 1</a> has been released. No, I'm not
        kidding, Action Quake 1, officially endorsed by the A Team too. Digital Nomad has been
        slaving away hard at this, unfortunately it's currently lacking servers but I strongly
        recommend you check it out still</p>
        <dt>What's that I hear you say &quot;Action Quake 1, eh? What a crazy idea, what's next,
          Action Doom?&quot; Well, now you mention it... Yes, it's true, there is an <a
          href="http://actiondoom.cjb.net/">Action Doom</a>. Quamosity is leading the Action Doom
          team and there is already a downloadable version. I played this myself with<a
          href="http://doomlegacy.sourceforge.net/"> Doom Legacy</a> (A Doom patch that makes the
          game truely 3D and supports 3dfx graphics cards), and I was amazed. Be sure to check this
          out</dt>
        <dl>
          <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
          <dt>Well, I think I've covered every Action mod except one, unless a certain {CoW} is making
            Action Pacman like rumors say, except Action Quake 2. Ahh Action Quake 2, what can we say
            about the grandpappy of Action? Well, quite a lot. Firstly the <a
            href="http://guild.telefragged.com/">Actor's Guild</a>, the official source for
            replacement models, skins, sounds etc has closed it's doors and will no-longer be
            accepting new submissions. The site will still be up, though, so you can get anything that
            is currently there. I'd like to thank all the various people who have staffed the Guild
            over the past few years, Gigolo, Hammer, ActMarine, S'kebe and the others I've
            missed for their hard work and dedication</dt>
        </dl>
        <p>Also on the AQ2 front, the <a href="http://aqdt.fear.net/">Action Quake Development
        Team</a> has released version 4.3d of their amazing Teamplay Edition. It's like regular
        AQ2 but better, there are many features that simply votes, ignoring players etc not to
        mention fixes for popular cheats such as the M4 script and 'weapons farming'. It's
        incredible, I urge any and every server admin out there to start using this, after a quick
        read of the readme. For some reason the main page hasn't been updated, so I'll link
        directly to the files. Grab the <a href="http://aqdt.fear.net/aqe/aqete-43d-x86.zip">Windows
        version</a> or <a href="http://aqdt.fear.net/aqe/aqete-43d-i386.tar.gz">Linux version </a>as
        appropriate and take your server to the next level<dl>
          <dt>One last AQ2 thing, check out <a href="http://aqdt.fear.net/aqe.htm">AQ: Espionage</a>,
            download the <a href="http://aqdt.fear.net/aqe/aqe3.3-client.exe">client pack</a> and grab
            a quick game on DaBoyz AQ:E at 209.201.80.121:27950. It's the greatest AQ2 variant ever,
            introducing lots of excellent scenarios and goals to liven up even the dullest of maps.
            Thanks go to Kramed for running this server, it's pretty-much the only place I play
            now</dt>
        </dl>
        <p>Having written all this, I think I'll grab a few of those 15 hours of sleep I need<dl>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#0080c0">Got the
        &quot;about us&quot; page up but it needs filled in. I have no idea what to put in there.
        Someone make something up about me and email it. The rest of you guys need to fill in your
        spots too. I put up the ip# of Merlin's server, been piddling around making small changes
        as part of my ongoing procrastination as far as starting the AUT page. Don't have UT,
        never played it and havn't been to the AUT board much so I have some research to do.
        Thanks to ScaryMalcolm we have some javascript happening on the website links page :).
        Thanks to Merlin the AQ2 server is up, and btw he's got it set at 5 grenades if you choose
        bandolier which can turn into hella fun depending on your playing style. Its running 1.52
        and the map rotation is pre-skyscraper sniper maps, lots of ground/buildings type strategy
        maps that also have the terrifying capability of being good sniper maps. Nice to see
        someone running some of the better old maps again, and I'm definately pro-friendly fire.
        Cuts down on the lamer spam monkeys a bit er I mean the spray and pray types. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#0080c0">Some news
        coming up soon about a new all inclusive one d/l AQ2 client pack with
        maps/skins/models/patches/you name it being put together by {FFJ}Black Monk, when I find
        out what alls included I'll post more news about it. People on slowdems whine about file
        size when d/l'n but take my word for it, i'm on a slowdem and I'd rather d/l 1 large file
        while asleep than spend 2 days d/l'n 400 separate files 5 at a time. I think its a great
        idea and thanks to Black Monk who took this task upon himself, a true contributor to the
        action community.</font><dl>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#0080c0">Howdy
        folks, Just wanted to let everyone know the AQ2 Zone server is up and running at
        24.14.245.124:27910. This is a Linux FF TP server open to the public 24/7, setup mostly
        for fun and practice but if someone wants to use it for a match that could be arranged.
        Most of the players there have been around Action for a long time and play for fun, no CLQ
        whores, lamers, cheaters or whiners wanted. I'm new to this so have patience, if you have
        any comments or suggestions email <a href="mailto:merlin@magicman.org">me</a>. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#0080c0">Hopefully
        the server will attract more people that play for fun and some competition and a test of
        your skills, rather than FPM seeking fools and people trying to find yet another way to
        gain an advantage. Aside from running the server I probably wont have much involvement on
        the site. Framers in charge now and has recruited some good help so I know this will
        become a resourceful and informative site for the Action community that is still growing
        every day.</font> <dl>
