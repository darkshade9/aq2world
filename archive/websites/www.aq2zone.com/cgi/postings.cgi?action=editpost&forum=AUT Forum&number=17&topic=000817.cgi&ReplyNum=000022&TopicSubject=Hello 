<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Okay, I guess I'll just ask then.

Oddjob, what exactly DO you want people to do here? What the fuck is the use of this messageboard? So people can whine about release dates? Or share their latest ideas about why AUT rocks eventhough they have never played it? Or why &lt;weapon X&gt; sucks and why you should have picked &lt;weapon Y&gt; instead? 

As soon as someone posts something that is even the slightest bit off topic (as in, it's not whining about AUT) then it's immediatley labeled "spam". I understand the fuss with the thread that was flooded with pictures. I admit, that was childish, but so was their reaction (stuff like "STOP THE FUCKING GAY PICTURES!!!" or something) and it doesn't even make sense. Why do you care if someone posts a picture in your thread?

But what's wrong here? h0nqi posts some bullshit like we're used to (I don't think he has ever written a sensible topic, and that's not necessarily a bad thing on all MB's except this one), he says "Hello kitty". I just made a picture involving a kitty that I posted in Oz's thread, and I decided to post it here too because of the "Hello kitty". Then BL3NDR (l33t name) proceeds to call me a fag0t in slightly different terms, and all of a sudden I (I assume you were mainly pointing at me again) am spamming the board.

Please tell me what I should do then. Apparantly we can't post pictures anymore. We can't post things that are OT in a thread that is non-OT. I don't get it..., what CAN we do?

Do you think you will be able to sustain an actual community on a board if you're going to play it like this? Just because 2 people hate pictures doesn't mean ALL people hate them, and eventually the regulars will grow tired of "When it AUT coming out?", "Weapon suggestions!", "I made a new wallpaper", and those kinds of threads, and people will want to make non-sense threads/posts. Why is that wrong? Or is it just that you don't like me and you'd rather have me shut up than posting here?

And this is not a trolling post or to annoy you. It's a sincere question.</TEXTAREA>
