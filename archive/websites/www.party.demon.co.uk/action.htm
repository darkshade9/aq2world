            href="http://www.barrysworld.co.uk/news/">Barrysworld</a> servers of late, will probably
            have noticed a phenomenon known as &quot;weapon farming&quot;. Basically this is a bug in
            the Action Quake 2 code that allows unlimited weapons to be spawned and dropped by a
            player. Unfortunately what this means is that [COK] Sucka joins a server and proceeds to
            spam weapons until the server can no longer cope and the whole thing seizes up in a laggy
            mess. This has no benefit for the player doing the spamming other than to totally screw up
            &nbsp; everyone else's game. How very clever they must feel. The IP of a recent spammer
            was found by an admin and the offending player was using a dial-up account in Cyprus. I
            wouldn't imagine too many people play from Cyprus so someone must know who this dickhead

            is a slightly more sinister use of this bug where a player can spawn ammo for himself.
            Obviously this is a definite advantage for the player and is out &amp; out cheating. A
            rather well known player was caught on server doing this the other day, for now I will not
            name names, but if he is caught again then I most certainly will name and shame him. Also
            If I catch anyone doing this while I am admin for a <a
            href="http://leagues.barrysworld.com/bwaqsl/default.shtm">BWAQSL</a> game then I will not
            only kick the offending player, but see if I can't get them banned from playing for the
            rest of the season (along with their clan too maybe). I really think cheating like this is
            about as low as you can go, especially in a serious clan league game and think no
            punishment is too sever for such people.</strong></font></p>

            Anyone who knows me also knows that I'm a shocking aliaser. I have justified this behavior
            to myself &amp; others many times in various ways, mainly along the lines of &quot;oh I
            just want to play quietly and anonymously &quot; or &quot;I'm just messing about and
            trying things out&quot;. Well recently trawling through a message board I came across
            these comments made by a Quaker called Starky. While the comments he has made are aimed at
            the Quake 3 Arena community, I feel his core argument is actually very relevant to all
            online gaming communities. Please read what he has to say after which you will find my own
            revised thoughts on the matter;</strong></font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px"><font face="Arial" size="2">I have heard
            every rationale for the use of aliases (as I'm sure we all have, at this late date), and
            quite honestly, I do not care to hear another. They exist mainly along these lines:
            &quot;but IM not playing for real, ill use my real nick for real games&quot; and
            &quot;this way, only my good buddies know who I am when I play.&quot; Perhaps it's just
            me, but these excuses wreak of personal insecurity, and psychological elitism. This
            attitude undermines the sense of community that drew many of us to the game; Quake is not
            about protecting one's own fragile ego or &quot;rep&quot;, it is about friendly
            competition. The existence of &quot;professional&quot; gaming and money prizes do not
            change this. To those who argue that this alias mentality is all in good fun, as when
            players on a pickup team change names to some given theme, I respond that it is far more
            serious than this: the situation is so severe that one would be hardpressed to find a
            single player who uses his accepted &quot;official&quot; nick. <br>
            <br>
            I personally will never use an alias, regardless of how irreversibly it may scorch my
            image (do I sound sarcastic? I apologize!). Despite any excuse an alias-using player may
            field in his own defense, the fact remains that the practice makes it extremely difficult
            for new competitors (or even existing ones who temporarily leave) to settle in, or feel
            comfortable. The &quot;community&quot; that we once enjoyed simply cannot exist under
            these sorts of conditions, with every player actively seeking to remain anonymous except
            in his moments of glory. When players will even fail to use their accepted nicks in a
            tournament game, it is obvious that there is a problem. I personally refuse to acknowledge
            that, as a whole, we're a community that is too ignorant to realize that these games are
            for fun, and that is tearing itself apart from within, without the slightest element of
            regard for the entry of new players. After all, if this is the case, why bother to involve
            oneself in it in the least? <br>
            <br>
            If you are a serious Quaker (as I consider myself to be), and if you do indeed care to do
            your part to make the Quake scene stronger, then DO NOT use an alias. It is a pervasive
            threat, but one which really IS destroying the factors that drew most of us here in the
            first place. Take a stand, and toss aside self-importance in favor of healthy
            competitiveness. Do not accept the use of aliases as just another fact of online Quake.</font></p>

            while, my eyes where finally opened to my own arrogance. So for instance &quot;I just want

            talk to you peons&quot; and for &quot;I'm just messing about and trying stuff&quot; read
            &quot;CLQ is my god and I don't want to damage my stats&quot;. I now see that using an
            alias is just a way of protecting a delicate ego. It's a no lose situation. If you stink
            in a game playing as an alias noone notices leaving the aliaser free to slink off, rep
            intact. But If you own the server people will invariably ask who you are at which point
            you can magnanimously reveal your true nick and revel in your l33t'ness. </strong></font></p>

            that really is unfair. If you stink and take a whooping then why shouldn't you give the
            person doing the owning the satisfaction of knowing exactly who is being owned! And
            doesn't the very act of trying to protect a rep, mean that you think you are something a
            bit tasty and have a rep to preserve in the first place. I don't think aliasing in Action
            Quake 2 is as prevalent or as damaging as it is in say Quake 3 arena, but having examined
            my own motives for aliasing and given some thought to all the possible motives for
            aliasing, I have come to the conclusion that it is a pretty shallow act and something I do
            not intend to do in future. Praise be for I have seen the light ;-)</strong></font></p>

            I have noticed lately that it's becoming increasingly difficult to consistently top the
            public servers. The general standard of play in Action Quake seems to be at an all time
            high. Why should this be? Certainly most people playing the game now have done so for
            quite some time, the newbie/vet ratio is strongly biased in favour of vets at the moment.
            However I think just as big a factor is the increase in the amount of LPB's now. High
            speed access for the masses is now a reality and modemers&nbsp; are getting fewer and
            fewer. Its now commonplace for servers to have more LPB's than modemers, and I for one
            think this is very good thing. As far as I'm concerned the day when everyone has a 50 ping
            can't come soon enough (although you 20ms pingers are taking the piss). it's actually
            pretty amusing when that oft heard cry of &quot;damn LPB's&quot; comes from the only HPB
            on a server populated with 11 LPB's and one HPW :) As an aside I think Makhno should be
            denied access to any high speed connection for all eternity. Its just too much fun seeing
            him blub! </strong></font></p>

                if its been done quicker. If anyone does it faster than 12 minutes then send me a screenie
                and ill put your name up in lights. Of course this is open to abuse as I'm sure all you
                l33t PhotoShop users can get a FL in 2 minutes so please try and be honest ;-)</strong></font></p>
