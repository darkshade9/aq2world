<tr><td class='forum2' width='59%'><P>LTKTBM has come a long way in what? 9 years.. This progress is probably the main reason I have not made this choice sooner. v1.9 is the first actually respectable, playable, standalone release, and I have to admit I've been loathed to go back to the days when releases just plain didn't work</P>
<P>Time is back on the endangered species list, so, I'm revising my previous couple of .plans slightly. Now instead of ploughing straight into v2.0, fully open source and progressing the related sub projects futher, these projects can wait slightly.</P>
<P>It seems, my friends, that your not happy with just watching a few videos of the new water engine, you actually want to <B>PLAY</B> it....</P>
<P>I have a new application based on the LTBTBM structure mentioned in the developer section, which for the near term has taken priority over LTKTBM. This project is now fairly well developed, with a beta being demo'd to clients at the the end of the month. However I'm also changing the priorities mentioned earlier and bringing the water engine up to #3 priority (below uni work and the application mentioned above)</P> 
<P>A pre-Alpha of this engine will probably be the next release on the site, the first thing I need to do is find its system requirements and get it working the same on all machines, this will probably take a couple of revisions to get working which is what I meant by going back to the days when releases just plain didn't work. Once this is passed the alpha stage, I will probably re-assess my position again, but untill then, expect to be able to make a splash sometime in the near(er) future.</P>
<P>XML is a lot like violence, if it doesn't do everything you need: Use more</P></td></tr>

<tr><td class='forum2' width='59%'>Following the recent hard drive failure I came very close to loosing a significant amont of work. Luckily this wasn't the case. Almost all the work lost has been proof of concept projects and a few minor revisions to existing code. Probably the only code that I shouldn't have lost is a new version of pathfinder - which shouldn't be to much work to recreate - the game of life earth applet and the lower control panel for milliEcon v0.2 (the engine for v0.2 and all of v0.1 is still here) - although because these last two were also proof of concept work, they dont represent a significant loss.<BR>
I'm now very close to having a linux box all up and working, which is where I'm going to shift most of my .dev work to.<BR> On the LTKTBM front, a release of LTKTBM_LITE will be the next release on the site, This also marks the start of LTKTBM v2.0, which will be a full GPL version of LTKTBM using the TNG code with some non GPL plugin extras of the most recent work done for the TBM_AI SDK. I also have some new gfx code on top of the water engine and skeletal physics which will probably make it to general release before these two, but I'll be keeping details of these close to my chest for now.<BR>
If all goes well over the next week or so, I'll probably be fully booked up until the end of september, this is a shame since, while donations have been enough to secure LTKTBM's place in history (BIG THANKS to everyone who has donated so far), they have not been of proficient quantity to secure as much of my time for now as I would have liked.
On that front I am very pleased with the work that has gone into the site over the past month or so, Pay-pal integration on the site all seems to be working smoothly now, and the new admin functions are an absolute dream to work with. Apologies to the one or two people who inadvertantly had their IPs banned during some of the security updates. I've been keeping a close eye on that front and I think I've ironed out all of the potentials for false positives that can arise, there may still be one or two areas of concern but all in all it seems to have gone well. </td></tr>

<tr><td class='forum2' width='59%'><p>So another year of TBM_AI has passed us by, and its time to lock down some 
  serious planning.</p>
<p>The segmentation of the overall project into its several sub projects has led 
  to greatly improved efficiency in both progressing the project and providing 
  substantial intermediate goals to aim for. This is one of the primary reasons 
  things have been quite quiet in this section for so long. The evolving site 
  design should now make it much easier to formalise goals and direction and in 
  this area one of the primary things I would like to publish soon is a model 
  of how the overall project has now been structured and the direction each aspect 
  is to take.</p>
<p>In actual development plans, it seems the primary sub projects to take precedence 
  is that of the AI itself, along with further releases of the openAL audio engine. 
  That said, this aspect is not entirely set in stone, with so many sub projects 
  to juggle, Its more than likely the priorities of the individual projects will 
  change over the year.</p>
<p>The fork of the AI project into a pure separate system has moved into the production 
  phase, for game players this has an important implications for future releases. 
</p>
<p>The release of LTKTBM v1.9 is pencilled in for a release date of the 6th of 
  June. Which I’m hoping should be achievable given my current time constraints, 
  and the remaining write up required on the site and installer.</p>
<p>LTKTBM v2.0 will now be the first official release with full true TBM_AI code, 
  probably built on an AQ2:The Next Generation (AQ2:TNG) backbone (CTF anyone??), 
  and maybe utilising the QFusion engine (although this possibility is subject 
  to attaining sufficient permission from the ReactionQuake 3 developers.).</p>
<p>The <a href='http://www.cam-direct.co.uk/ltk/index2.php?location=Water Engine&expand=31'>water project for the engine</a> as well as the <a href='http://www.cam-direct.co.uk/ltk/index2.php?location=Ragdol Physics&expand=31'>Skeletal/Ragdol Physics</a> models, will 
  remain for now as teasers to promote site donations, If the number of donations 
  are sufficiently high, these sub projects (including LTKTBM v2.0) will move 
  up the priority queue from other projects which could be consuming my time over 
  the next twelve months. For hints as to what these might be you need merely 
  look in the developer section of the site at things such as <a href='http://www.cam-direct.co.uk/ltk/index2.php?location=milliEcon v2&expand=30'>milliEcon</A>, <a href='http://www.cam-direct.co.uk/ltk/index2.php?location=Game of Life - Earth&expand=30'>game 
  of life - Earth</a> and the <a href='http://www.cam-direct.co.uk/ltk/index2.php?location=Dictionary&expand=28'>Dictionary</a>.</p>
<p>On top of all this, I move into the 3rd year of Economics and Computer Science, 
  at Liverpool University in September. Which is always going to be at the very 
  top of my priorities, but we’re still someway off that, and until then, what 
  happens next is up to you.<br>

<tr><td class='forum2' width='59%'>OK, so one or two people may be wondering whats been happening, well, I haven't gone anywhere other than moved 30 odd miles west to start the Accounting and Computer Science degree at liverpool university, so thought I'd better put up something of how this most eventfull week has progressed, what the current situation is, and where I go from here:<BR><BR>

I'm here, Im more or less settled in, my room is very comfortable, plenty of space, and not only do I have among the highest speeds of internet access for the next year, but my uni filespace has 200MB of space which can be made available via the www (read; no more trouble getting test releases out).<BR><BR>

This semester, at first glance looks fairly laid back, although I have to state, given that I'm forking out all this cash for this course I plan on coming out with a 1st, this is my top priority, it sucks because I would absolutely love to concentrate a large portion of time to this and the other projects that have been taking up my time, but uni work must take priority over everything else, so, as has been so well spelled out in my first few microeconomics lectures, Time is one commodity I dont really have, you'd be surprised how even the smallest things can escalate to consume large amounts of it, but given my recent improvements in general planning I should still be able to progress stuff quite nicely.<BR><BR>

The openAL audio engine: Theres been some great improvements here in the general code and integration into the engine. The first day here I spoke to the Computer Science department regarding any advice they could give regarding licensing this little buet similarily to FMOD; They basically came back with it being a great idea, but also attempted to [b]steal[/b] it. No way I'm letting this happen. However it has been suggested that Business Link may be able to provide finance, assistance and support. I still need to investigate this further. More updates to follow.<BR><BR>

AI:  I didn't even mention any of the AI stuff I've been doing given the above and recent research has led me to believe even more strongly that Im onto a serious winner with this one, this means its been pushed back on the priority list even further for now. I have however made some small improvements since the last release, and will complete the integration into gamplay for the recently added M16/M203.<BR><BR>

LTKTBM/General Engine: Theres been many leaps and bounds since the last release, mostly all the stuff I wanted to hold back on for the last release so I could bundle it all into one release and give some real 'shock factor'. Its unfortunatley looking like its going to be another week or so before I can get my linux box over here for finishing the nix openal engine, theres also the engine generic content release to compile (no more linkfile dependance in the package), now I've got all this extra server space putting this lot up for evaluation is going to be alot easier, it is however going to be at least a week or so before I can get any decent time into doing this. There may be a windows alpha release of the recent work available shortly for beta testers to evaluate.<BR><BR>

General: This semesters CS module is java based, so not much programming I can do in the way of ltktbm, however the focus on software developement techniques has given me some good ideas on how to develope the TBM_AI sdk and also openAL engine documentation. The microeconomics module has, surprisingly a lot to contribute to the AI as a whole, and I already have some new ideas on future developements for it. The accounting module is, well, accounting...</td></tr>
