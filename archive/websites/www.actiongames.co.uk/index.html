<p>Game have just released the following:
<br>
<br><span class="small">Quote:</span><br><span class="quote">&quot;We are sad to announce that the Multiplayer service will be closing on 23rd January 2004. After nearly three years of operating the service, in its various guises, we&#39;ve made the decision to focus our online activity on core e-commerce services, both in the UK and Europe.
<br>
<br>The Multiplayer Team would like to thank everyone who helped build The Multiplayer Service into the award-winning operation it is today, especially all of the dedicated volunteers who have given their time and effort to the Service over the years - we couldn&#39;t have done it without you.
<br>
<br>We know you will have a number of questions about the closure and we will be available on IRC (#GAME.NET) on January 5th to answer your questions.&quot;</span></p>

<p><a name='87'></a><span class="title">Steam - Cold and Wet?</span><span class="small">&nbsp;&nbsp;by GBee at 23:57:07</span></p>
<p>Valve&#39;s Steam project is causing quite a heated debate in our forums (pun intended). Just a short time after it&#39;s official release and with their WON ID servers due to be shutdown soon there are some real concerns being expressed on a number of issues. For example only days after the release of Counter Strike 1.6 through the Steam network there are some obvious flaws and cheats. Non-broadband users are dismayed to discover that they cannot play their beloved game and some are just angry at the downtime suffered by the service. Is this the end of Half Life and it&#39;s various mods? What about Half Life 2, have Valve already damaged it&#39;s chances and will Doom 3 sneak back to the forefront to become the game of the year?
<br>
<br>Why don&#39;t you register and have your say? <img src="https://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.actiongames.co.uk/actiongames/smilies/smile.gif" height="16" width="16" alt=""></p>

<p><a name='86'></a><span class="title">Counter-Strike 1.6</span><span class="small">&nbsp;&nbsp;by Fean0r at 19:52:57</span></p>
<p>Counter-Strike 1.6 has been officially released on Monday, 15th September 2003.
<br>
<br>The game itself seems but have lots of new and nifty features with many improvments focusing on gameplay (for example you get a point if you plant the bomb and a point if you defuse the bomb).
<br>
<br>As most of you will be aware 1.6 has been brought to us via Steam <a href="http://www.steampowered.com" target="_BLANK" class="pagelink">http://www.steampowered.com</a> (A great idea from Valve with more flaws than my grammer <img src="https://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.actiongames.co.uk/actiongames/smilies/smile.gif" height="16" width="16" alt="">)
<br>
<br>Hopefully over the next few weeks Valve will get Steam to work properly and we can all return to some great nights of CS <img src="https://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.actiongames.co.uk/actiongames/smilies/smile.gif" height="16" width="16" alt="">
<br>
<br>Valve has also released patches for various HL MOD&#39;s, you find the link below along with a link for Steam itself.

<p>Greeting!
<br>
<br>Season 3 of our Counter-Strike 3 v 3 Leagues will be commencing Monday 1st September 2003. We offer a friendly forward thinking league offering various rules and maps that should keep the majority interested and happy.
<br>
<br>This season we will be introducing our first dedicated league server, however having your own server will be an advantage as the likelihood is our server will be very busy! If your clan is interested in sharing a server with another clan drop us a line and we&#39;ll try to hook you up with others looking the same thing.
<br>
<br>If you&#39;d like to take part visit our site, then register as a user then click the create team option in the user menu!
<br>
<br>For more information visit <a href="http://www.actionleague.co.uk" target="_BLANK" class="pagelink">http://www.actionleague.co.uk</a> or email us on <a href="mailto:admin@actionleague.co.uk">admin@actionleague.co.uk</a>
<br>
<br>Thanks

<p><a name='83'></a><span class="title">Server Watch</span><span class="small">&nbsp;&nbsp;by Fean0r at 16:59:29</span></p>
<p>I was browsing lately for through various pieces of HL server software and came across this nice little number.  I&#39;m sure many people are already of it existance but this is for though that aren&#39;t!
<br>
<br><span class="small">Quote:</span><br><span class="quote">&quot;Server Watch allows you to monitor and administer many of todays and yesterdays most popular game servers.&quot;</span>
<br>
<br><span class="small">Quote:</span><br><span class="quote">&quot;Server Watch can either be purchased or run for free as Adware.&quot;</span>
<br>
<br><span class="small">Quote:</span><br><span class="quote">&quot;We do not use third party spyware to deliver the ads.&quot;</span>
<br>
<br>Thats some of the information on the site, you can monitor as many servers of various game types as you like and you can also use a basic remote admin facility.
<br>
<br>The Server Watch can continually monitor your server and send you emails if the server does down (as below)
<br>
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Server Watch has detected that one of the servers it is monitoring is down....
<br>
<br>Name:        =UKE=
<br>Message:     Timeout
<br>Server Type: Half-Life
<br>Address:     195.149.21.58
<br>Port:        27035
<br>Date/Time:   Sun May 25 17:45:59 2003]</span>
<br>
<br>....and again it will notify you when your server has gone back up <img src="https://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.actiongames.co.uk/actiongames/smilies/smile.gif" height="16" width="16" alt="">
<br>
<br>The software also allows you to watch for clan mates joining the server alerting you via an email or sound.  All round I&#39;ve found this it be a handy program (especially since jolt are so prone to crashing <img src="https://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.actiongames.co.uk/actiongames/smilies/smile.gif" height="16" width="16" alt="">)
<br>

<p>Hi, I&#39;d just like to apologise for the lack of regular updates currently. The staff at Actiongames are kept busy by real life more and more and we have little time to devote to the things we love, including this site. Now that certainly doesn&#39;t mean its been abandoned and if I could just finish the background work we have plans to add columns and articles ... keep your fingers crossed. <img src="https://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.actiongames.co.uk/actiongames/smilies/smile.gif" height="16" width="16" alt="">
<br>
<br>In the mean time I&#39;ve been getting some info on the <a href="www.dragonempires.com" target="_BLANK" class="pagelink">Dragon Empires</a> MMORPG currently in production. It looks  and sounds extremely promising but we&#39;ve a long time to wait before it will hit the shelves.
<br>
<br>Our forums continue to be busy and we happily invite everyone to join in, who knows, it could be your first step to working here.</p>
