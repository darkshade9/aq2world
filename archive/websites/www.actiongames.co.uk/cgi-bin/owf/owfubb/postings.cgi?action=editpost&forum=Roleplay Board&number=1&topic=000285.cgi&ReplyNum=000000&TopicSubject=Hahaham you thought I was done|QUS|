<font size=3><font face="Metallica"><font color=bloodyred>{The scene opens up as Flash is sitting in his car, waiting for somone to fill it up. He's beens sitting there foir five minutes, finally a guy comes walking out to the car.}

</font color><font color=yellow>Man-"Sorry Sir, we're closed for the evening, but come back tomorrow. Thank you."

</font color><font color=bloodyred>{Flash gets a smirk on his face and he opens the door of teh car and gets out. He walks up form behind to that guy and turns him around.}

Flash-"Understand this, SIR, I'm Flash, nowof the OWF and I have an interview in like five minutes, but your ass is too god damn lazy to fill up my car! So here's soemthing in return!"

{Flash acts like he's going to punch him, but instead pokes him in the ye and kicks him in the family jewels.}

Flash-"How'd that feel? Well you better tell Shawn Mathews how it feels to gte kicked in the nuts! So why not have my interview right here!"

Flash-"Shawn, I know you're not this weak bastard that just got kicked in the nuts, but I can make you like this guy by giving you the ass-whooping that you deserve from a man that can beat your ass! I will too, without a thought of a doubt, when I beat your ass it won't be funny! Now, I kow I can beat you, you're not that good, and I seriously don't give a rats ass of what you think! I don't, so what, I may be an asshole, who cares, I've been called worse before, what the hell makes a difference!"

Flash-"Tonight, in our one on one battle, you're not putitng your title on the line, fine with me, but here's what I'm willing to do for you nd I'll make the Prez make it this kind of match! A Career Match! That means you lose, you're out, I lose, I'm out! Not hard to understand, is it? So if you lost, your Mathews World Title will be vacant! So Mathews, you got the balls to do that? I highly doubt that, but come on, if you're suppose to be so big and bad, put your shitty ass career on the line! I have nothing to lsoe because I'm already in anotehr fed as it is, so I don't care if I ose! But Shawn, put your caree ron the line and I will do the same and we'll see who's actually better at the game they love ot play! I know I'm better than you because you say the same dam shit everytime you talk,"Flash tihnks this, Flash thinks that!" Well Shawn, if you got a problem with me, just bring it man!"

Flash-"And hey, IF you win, guess what, you won't have to worry about anyone making fun of you whiel you're the President anymore! So Bitch, I'll see you tonight!"

{Flash hops back in his car and drives away whiel that guy is still laying in the dirt.}
