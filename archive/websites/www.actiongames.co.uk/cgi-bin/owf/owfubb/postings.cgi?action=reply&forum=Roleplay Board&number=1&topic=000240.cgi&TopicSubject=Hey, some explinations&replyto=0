<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Saynt:
[B]OOC: Sorry I haven't roleplayed guys, I have had problems with my computer at home and stuff so I haven't been able to pull a good one off, I am doing this during computer class so it won't be best quality because I need to rush through it.

(((the camera comes into Saynt's apartnment)))

Saynt: Sup.  Well I have a few things to say, first off, as always, concerning the man known as Marasmus.  Marasmus...it seems we are growing apart as brothers, may be it is because i haven't been saying much lately or maybe it is because you are afraid at some stuff I might reveal about your past--which I might if I want.

And my other friend, Bloodshed, I know you are in jail temporarily for some stupid reason (OOC: He is moving, so I just made up the temporary jail thing now) So you haven't said much...ahhh, don't you remember the last time you were in jail?  Payback's a bitch isn't it, and you are realizing how hard it is to acheive, you see Bloodshed, i don't know why you don't go out and tell everyone exactly why you hate me and why you used to hate Marasmus from the get-go.  Why don't you tell them?

Is it because you are so secretive and have problems being social with people and sharing emotions?  Is it because you are afraid about what might happen if you tell...and maybe other things will emerge about your past that could get you, or someone else...in trouble? Is it because if you tell you will feel less of a man?  If this is the case I advise you, don't think about it, look at one of your only friends, Angel, who has been less of a man, I think I could go so far as to say he is GIRLY.  But oh well, it's your life...we can only imagine what discusting things are going on in jail with you right now...ewww.

But that's all from me for now, go away, seriosuly, go away!  GO AWAY DAMMIT!!!
