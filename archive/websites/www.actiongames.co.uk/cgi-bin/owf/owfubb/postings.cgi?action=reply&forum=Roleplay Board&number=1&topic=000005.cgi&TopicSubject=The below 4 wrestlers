He is wearing a white t-shirt as usual & has on baggy cargo orange pants. He is laid back with his arms spread on the top of the couch & his legs spread open. He closes his legs & sits up taking his arms off the top of the couch, after a few seconds of looking at the camera. He leans towards the camera & begins to speak.]<P>Shawn:Well, I've haven't said much in a while, but I can see I should have. We now have a bunch of wrestlers running wild, thinking there something great. Jack Flagg is back, cockier then ever. He is boring me to death about how he is gonna beat everyone in this fed, yet he forgets to mention what happened in his last match, which made him run from this federation. <P>[Shawn smiles for a few seconds. Then goes back to talking.]<P>Shawn:Now Mars bars guy, I don't know or care what your name is, & it's to stupid for me to remember. So Mars guy, don't even think of Bloodshed. You'll have to wait your turn before you get a match with him. So go back to playing with that pimped out ho of yours. Then in a week or so, you can have what ever is left of Bloodshed. Now onto my ex-opponent. Bloodshed, my beating has not been postponed. I never had a beating schedule. I did have a match with you scheduled though & unfortunatly, I'll just have to wait to hurt my hands on your forehead. So untill the near future when we get our match rescheduled, I suggest you don't try & book a flight out of the country, so you don't have to face me. If you happen to try & do that, I will have someone else find you beat you up twice as bad. Right now, I have 2 Light's Out planned for you. You keep pissing me off with your gay comments & I'll keep adding on to that. As for your cage match. I'll do it. Except I don't wanna play by your rules. You would probally beat me in the match you stated. Since from what I've seen from you, your good at running & I don't want to have a match where you win, because you ran out of a cage & hid from me. So the winner will be determined by knock out, or submission. No pins. Will put a roof over the top of the cage & cover the cage & turnbuckles with barbwire. Hell we'll even get rid of the ropes & put 4 barbwire ropes on. How's that sound. Trust me, this match will live up to your name. Niether of us will leave without a drop of blood from our body. I even have another great idea, let's put in a barbwired baseball bat on the top of the cage & a ladder in the cage to reach it in the cage. How's that sound for extreme, hardcore & the new revolution of wrestling. How about it Bloodshed. Agree to that & let's have this match at the pay per view. What a great match to main even the PPV. Will call this match, a Death Match. So let's review it once again. A cage with a roof & a ladder inside the cage. A barbwire baseball bat will be attached to the top of the cage. Barbwire will also be strung around the cage & turnbuckles. We won't have regulation ropes, but 4 barbwire ones instead. Also just for the heck of it, we'll throw in a roll of barbwire too & whatever other barbwired item you would like to bring. So president & Bloodshed, agree to my death match for the ppv. I gauruntee this will get the one main thing this fed wants, ratings.<P>[Shawn looks down, then looks up & has a serious look on his face.]<P>Shawn:Now since some little putz named Angel wants to fight me at the PPV, how about we make that match to some weekday or weekend show if he can get his head out of Bloodshed's ass. I mean, no one really wants to see me beat this guy up. So Angel if we get a card in before the PPV, you & me can fight, so I have a warmup match before the PPV. I mean no offense, but your just not Shawn Matthews quality. So you should be glad I am offering you a match on a small show against me. Now camera man leave. I have said all I want. Now I am gonna sit back & wait for answers. <P>[The camera cuts out.]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Verdana">MaRaSmUs</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Verdana">(OOC) im sorry...bloodshed has had this PPV deathmatch scheduled for about a month now...YOU will be the one that has to wait...sorry.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
