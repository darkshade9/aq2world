<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">(((Angel's voice, whispering)))

Angel:  Ok, I cannot do this on camera because it will make too much noise and definately make light, and if I leave the light off there really isn't a point to use a camera, so I am using a tape recorder, hopefully this gets to someone.  At TNT I was there for the royale rumble, which never happened, but while I was there the information that was leaked to me was Bloodshed was in jail and won't be out soon, well maybe soon, but sorry Bloodshed, not soon enough.  So I took it upon myself to by this cheap peice of crap from the Madison Square Garden gift shop and run out to do this.

You see, I can't take it there anymore, actaully it has gotten to the point to where I don't know what I want anymore or even why I am doing this.  I know that he will find me, but I figure my chances are better here, in the dark in the middle of a forest, than there, with him.  Bloodshed, this message is for you only: I am near the major city- OH SHIT...what was that!  Oh well, Bloodshed you know where I am, bread and butter--only bloodshed will know what that means.  

But on to more important things, I wanted so much to reveal to everyone who sacrificed themself for me, so now I may say, before he catches up to me, hopefully he hasn't realized I am gone yet--the man that sacrificed himself was- (ROAR!!!)  

Angel: HOLY SHIT!  I knew I heard something!   What was that, I can't see anything, I will have to use my emergency flashlight.  Oh shit, I am right by some swamp marshes...I hope it's not (you hear some rustling dry leaves)  OH GOD!  It's a ALLIGATOR!!!  (you hear Angel run and roaring from the alligator)  Oh fuck, ANOTHER!  Where are these all coming from, a marsh, why was I stupid, a man I can fight but- TWO MORE!   (you hear angel run, now his voice is panting)  Ok, if-i---can---jump--over---one of them and get-- to the tree, yes, I'll stick out in the tree!  

(((You hear Angel's feet run through the once dry leaves now he is in a muddy place)))

OH FUCK!  I didn't make it, the alligator bit my leg, I am lying on the ground, with at least 12 alligators surrounding me!  (Angel screams)  SOMEONE HELP!  MY LEG IS BLEEDING!!!  

(you hear a zipping sound as Angel screams)

Angel: What the hell!  I must have set off an alligator trap...I am haning in a net 25 feet in the air on a tree, and looking down at the alligators, who are just waiting for me to fall...this is a weird alligator trap though, from what it looks like it is set off manu--OH SHIT!  

"His voice": Angel...did you really think you could get away?  You know I know where you are one way or another, and I knew you would end up here, you really are predictable Angel.  I'll give props to you, you are smart, you really are, you REALLY REALY ARE! (demonic laughing)</TEXTAREA>
