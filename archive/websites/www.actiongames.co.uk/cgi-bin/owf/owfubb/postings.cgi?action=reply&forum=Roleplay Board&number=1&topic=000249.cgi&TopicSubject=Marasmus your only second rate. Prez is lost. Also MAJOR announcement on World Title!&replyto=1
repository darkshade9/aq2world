He is bent over & aiming at getting the cue ball to hit the 8 ball. He hits the cue ball, which smacks into the 8 ball sending it at the whol on the other side. The 8 ball misses the whole though & bounces off. Suddenly a big motor cycle type guy in jeans & a white t-shirt with leather pants comes onto the scene. He smacks the cue ball into the 8 ball, sending the 8 ball into the pocket & winning the game for him. He then looks over to Shawn.]<P>Biker:Pay up punk!<P>[Shawn grabs out his wallet & pulls out a $100 bill. As he hands the guy the bill, another biker smacks a wooden chair over the biker that beat Shawn causing the first biker to stumble forward. The second biker then grabs the first bikers stick & chokes him with it. After a few seconds the first biker falls down to the floor unconsious. Shawn then gives the bill to the second biker. He then walks away smiling towards the counter. A bar tender comes over to him.]<P>Bar Tender:Umm, are you going to pay for that chair, or is your hired man going to.<P>Shawn:Hired man? <P>[Shawn laughs for a few seconds.]<P>Shawn:I didn't hire him to do anything. I didn't expect to lose. I usually win, but I just didn't tonight. One not so dumb biker took advantage of the situation & beat up the other biker. The smart biker got paid the dumb biker's money. The moral of the story, look for the easiest way to get something.<P>[The bar tender looks confused, but after a few seconds figures out what Shawn just said.]<P>Bar Tender:That reminds me of you. Always winning your matches by disqualification & never defending your title. <P>[Shawn grabs the bar tender by his tie & pulls the bar tender toward him, choking the bar tender. Shawn then angrily tells the bar tender is opinion.]<P>Shawn:You listen here, you worthless bar junkie. I defend my title when I feel someone deserves a shot. No one is good enough right now to where they deserve a shot at my World Title. So untill someone improves alot more, I won't defend my title, untill the next pay per view. Do you understand that? No understand this. I want you to drag your little white ass & to go mix up some triple sac & tequila & make me a margarita.<P>[Shawn let's go of the bar tender. The bar tender loosens his tie & quickly gets away from Shawn. The bar tender then goes over to get a glass & start working to make Shawn his drink. The camera then shows Shawn from his shoulders up.]<P>Shawn:Now Marasmus, you think your this great defending champion. You think your so great & you've held 3 titles in this federation. You also think your better then the World's champion, myself. Well guess what little Mars, I beat you already. So I guess that makes me better then you. Also as far as you go with all your representations & representing this company & what representing your little half ass title, your full of shit. Your a 2nd rate champion, so anyone who looks at this federation looks at the head champion. Anyone who looks at the first super bowl remembers that Green Bay won & became the NFL champions. No one remembers who they beat, no one remembers the 2nd best team that year, & ya know what Mars? No one cares & you know what. Now that I think of it, your not even second rate, because the .Org title is like the lowest of all 4 singles titles. So your really just a worthless wrestler that no one really cares about besides me & I only care about you because I'm drunk, or atleast soon will be. <P>[The bar tender is seen again walking towards Shawn. He gives Shawn his drink & then quickly moves away, still scared of Shawn. Shawn takes a swallow of his drink & then puts it back down.]<P>Shawn:Now this brings me up to another point. Now being the World Champion & having more say in this company then anyone, including our lovely, unintelligent president, I have decided to make an announcement. Since many of our athletic trophies are named after a great coach or player who held them, I would like to now dedicate this OWF World title to our first & greates champion ever in this federation. Oh, wait a second. I've held this belt from day one, so I guess it's gonna be named after me.<P>[Shawn laughs at another of his not so funny jokes, as if it were histarical.]<P>Shawn:Anyways, as I was saying. This belt will from now on be known as the OWF Matthew's World Championship. Not the OWF WWW championship. <P>[Shawn takes another drink of his margarita.]<P>Shawn:Now I was told by our lovely, confused president in a recent phone call that I recieved while promoting our horrible Saturday show that I would face some worthless rookie named New Blood & Marasmus in a 3 way dance for the worthless .Org title. Now I looked at the schedule I was given for our worthless Saturday show & noticed Marasmus had a title match for the .Net title. Now since he already has a match planned for his .Org title Tuesday, I will face Marasmus in a .Net/.Org/World Title shot match next Saturday. Yes this is another one of my great stipulations that is never listened to. If I win I get the .Org & .Net titles. This giving me 3 out of 4 of our titles. Now if God feels sympathy for Mars, & lets him win & hell freeze over, then he will recieve a shot at my OWF Matthew's World Championship, at a later date to be determine at a later time. Now Mr. President, please call me if this is ok, before Saturday night. Just so I know if I should give a little help to Mars, so he can hold the .Net title for a week for me. Now Mike, try & do what I've asked & let me know if my match will happen Saturday. See Mike, I really am a nice guy. I'm helping you out with your company, since you obviously can't do it by yourself. Now if I wanted to I could just go make the match since I do pull all the strings around here & you know it, but then what would you have to do over the weekend, except make matches for next week for me. Anyways, before I take up to much of commercial time on your tv, I think I will end my lovely promo, with a quick summary of what I've said today.<P>[Shawn takes a drink of his margarita again & a deep breath.]<P>Shawn:The OWF WWW. Championship, is now the OWF Matthew's World Championship. Marasmus is not second rate, but 4th rate. Which makes him the worst champion in the federation & finally our President is an idiot & our new President is ME! How, I can do all this you may ask, well that's simple. I AM YOUR OWF Matthew's World Champion.<P>[Shawn smiles wickedly at the camera as he cuts away.]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Verdana">Stewart Hix</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Verdana">Ya know the funniest thing, after I completely humilate you in my past 2 promos you still dont have the guts to even mention the ultimate heel, its only a matter of time before your forced to get in the ring, you see you ran wild over a bunch of nobodys, well guess what, your now considered the nobody with Stewart Hix in the fed.
