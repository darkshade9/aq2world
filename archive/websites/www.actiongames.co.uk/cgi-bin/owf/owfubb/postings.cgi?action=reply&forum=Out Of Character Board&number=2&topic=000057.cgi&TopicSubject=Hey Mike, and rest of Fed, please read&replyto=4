I don't really care for a full out results (but I do appreciate the effort). Really all I care for is how the match started and ended with any highlights in the middle.<P> Here is an example of a what Iwrestling.com is doing:<P>===============<P> "Billy Gunn with Chyna took on Val Venis with Steven Richards. Before the match started Eddie Guerrero came out. This distracted Gunn and Val was able to take an early advantage. Billy took advantage later in the match and Steven Richards was thrown in the ring for trying to grab his leg. Billy then took care of both of them and then hit the Fame-Asser on Val for the win."<P>==============<P> I think people (myself anyway) would prefer results that will just do that.<BR> With the focus on how the match ended, not every move during the match...<P> I think that instead of writting all of it down, we would prefer more constant site updates and more goodies for the players (like merchandise page, CDs featuring wrestler's theme, and other stuff)<P> What does everybody think?<P> Would you like to see a short passage summerizing your match, or a full detailed results (and making Mike's job difficult)<P>--Of course sometimes there will be run-ins and interviews that the players will write and submit, but that will be added into the results fully--<P> I just want to get people's opinions about this, and try to make Mike's work a bit easier so he will have more time to deal with our angles and the site.<P> Please, reply (everybody) and tell me what you think</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Verdana">MaRaSmUs</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Verdana">wow...i think you put it wrong when you said "who would like full results (and make mikes job difficult)" that doesnt mean i perfer long results, but when you say that, it makes anyone who like full results to not want to say it. me personally, i like both. i like long ones because it makes it more realistic, and not many feds to that. i honetlys dont really care. whatever mike likes, im all for it.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Verdana">Night Crawler</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Verdana">Hehe... I guess you are right, I am kind of trying to influance the voters in my question... <P>Good point, and point well taken.<P> Let me try to rephrase my question then:<BR>(question to the fed)<P> If Mike is rushed on time or has a bad day, would you mind if he would just write short passages to describe what happened, or you will only stick around if the results will be hand written, move by move?<P> (I think that's better)  Let me know what you think. </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Verdana">Scotty_Hinton</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Verdana">If Mike needs help with the results, I'll be glad to help him out if need be.

The latter was a lazy git and the fed was shut quickly because 'he had too many important tests'. Bollocks.<P>My point, which I unsuccessfully made, was that although Mike doesnt appear to be a lazy git, when you only get the highlight results you do lose a certain feel for the matches. Hell, I THINK that Mike wishes to make this federation popular with fans, not just wrestlers, and by just typing out the highlights, that isnt going to be as successful as one may hope.<P>Again, my attempt at making a valid point has gone hideously wrong. If Mike can carry on doing too much hard work, then let him, if he can't, let him. I can say that honestly because, as a new person who hasnt even been accepted into the fed, yet, my conscience can't be broken down because of Night Crawlers fears of us making him feel bad.<P>PS - LET ME JOIN! lol<P></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
