<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Crag:
[B](Crag is shown standing in his house.  The only thing he has on is black  shorts.  He motions for the camera to follow him and he walks down a  hallway.  He enters a room where there is an indoor swimming pool.  He gets in the pool and sits on  the steps to an island in the center of the pool.  Indigo walks into the room gets in the water, and meets him in the middle.  She has on an orange bikini.  She sits down beside him and he begins to talk to the camera.)

Crag:  Dread X is my opponent for Saturday for those who don't already know.  When the match was first signed i thought i may finally get to fight somebody that was normal.  I was wrong this time,  the guys just gets out of the hospital, and he claims to be able to kick my ass on Surge.  IF you were a little sore after TNT then you’ll be really sore after Surge, ask Tokyo about that.  I loosened some of his bolts, he’s psycho now.  Sure I agreed to the hardcore rules match, because that is the way I started out my career in the Japanese deathmatches.  I'm not sure if the Prez has made it a hardcore rules match, he may be protecting you from the American Hero.  You do have to go through me to the top but that’s not as easy as you may think.  I don’t lose often in these situation, hardcore is my home.  LA is a city where many tough people have come from are you one of them.  I will soon find out, and you may too.   Time is getting closer isn't it less than 48 hours.  This is the point where the butterfly’s start forming.  Especially under these preferred stipulations.  You could easily be destroyed in hardcore matches.  You may even die, and then do something dumb like come back in a week, and lose all respect you once had.  Just getting in the same ring with me you will get respect from a lot of people, including me.  Prepare for destiny Dread X.

(He looks at Indigo.  Who is very beautiful by the way.  Then he goes off the steps into the water.  He comes back up in a few seconds and sits back down.)

Crag:  Lastly, Scotty Hinton.  Their is nothing i want more right now than to kick your ass in a match.  Everything you say does nothing to me it may get you to believe that im trying to avoid you but it is totally false.  Eventually you will get your shot at revenge and fail again .  You can make a career out of it the Calgary Brawler we can call you.  Everybody will know who you are but won’t really care about you.   Basically like your current state, except very few know of you.  Have fun while you can judgment day will soon arrive.

(He grabs a hold of Indigo and pulls her under the water.  He then comes up laughing  and she goes after him as the screen fades to black.)[/B][/QUOTE]
