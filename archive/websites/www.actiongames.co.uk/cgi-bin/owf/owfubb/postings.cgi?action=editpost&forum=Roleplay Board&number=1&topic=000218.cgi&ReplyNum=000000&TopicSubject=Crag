<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL"><font color=white>(The scene opens up to trees and bushes whizzing by.The camera looks down and the road is passing by at a convient 30 MPH.The camera looks out the window and the people are apparently wealthy.Each house is about 3 stories high with huge yards in front.The van slows down and pulls into a driveway.It has a basketball goal at the end,and a black and gold Roles Royce sitting in the open garage.There is a man polishing the wheels.The van comes to a stop.The cameraman opens the door and walks over to the man polishing the wheels.)

<font color=green>Cameraman:Mr.Gambino?

<font color=blue>Man:What?! Where? Where?

<font color=green>Cameraman:No,are you Mr.Gambino.

<font color=blue>Man:No,No,shooo,you scared the piss out of me.I thought he was around.You know that Mr.Gambino has got to be one of the meanest son of a bitches I've ever met.I'm just glad he's not he...

<font color=yellow>Jack:Jerry,you better watch your mouth,before you get hurt.Are you done polishing the wheels?

<font color=blue>Jerry:Uhhh,I'm sorry,sir.Yes,I just got done.

<font color=yellow>Jack:No,you didn't.You missed a spot.

<font color=white>(Jack kicks the rim and makes a black mark on the rim.He then slaps the man and makes him fall off of the stool he was sitting on.)

<font color=yellow>Jack:This is no way to become a made man.If you ever talk about me behind my back again,your punishment will be more severe and the family will decide on what to do with you.Now,finish polishing that rim,or it's your ass.

<font color=white>(Jerry sets the stool back up and starts to polish the rim.He is holding his face where Jack smacked him.Jack smiles and nods his head for the camera to come inside with him.As the camera follows Jack,it enters a very plush house.The walls are decorated with magazines,trophies,pictures,and belts from other federations.Jack leads them to a white couch and motions for them to sit down.Ace is sitting on a bar stool,having a drink.Jack motions him over.)

<font color=yellow>Jack:Ace,could you grab me a brandy.

<font color=red>Ace:Sure thing,Jack.

<font color=yellow>Jack:Could I offer you guys something to drink.Scotch,Brandy,Vodka?

<font color=green>Cameraman:No,thank you,Mr.Gambino.

<font color=yellow>Jack:Suit yourself.

<font color=white>(Ace walks over with two drinks in his hand and gives Jack one of the glasses.Ace walks over to a very expensive looking chair and sits down.Jack walks over to an ancient recliner.He sits down,crosses his legs,takes a sip from his drink,and then sits it down on an inn table beside him.)

<font color=yellow>Jack:So,what brings you to my humble abode today.

<font color=green>Cameraman:Well,I just wanted to ask what you thought about your first match with Crag.

<font color=yellow>Jack:Well,it has been brought to my attention that Crag wants to mess with me,and who in the hell is he anyway,I'll whip his ass all over that damn arena.Let's take a look at when I won my first World Championship,and I'll show you what will happen.

<font color=white>(Ace gets up and turns off the lights.A big screen TV turns on,and we are taken back to last night.It has a scene from backstage.Bischoff walks in
Bischoff: Hey man, I am making the main event a no DQ guitar match.
JP: Whatever, I don't care
Scene fades back to announce table
Jack fast forwards to the main event.
Both men make their way out to the ring with guitar. Cron-eX takes control of the match. As the match moves on JJ begins to work back. All of the sudden music that has been heard before but not for a long time hits the system. The Gambinos run from the crowd, they take out The Cat, and Jack hops in the ring with Cron-eX's Get it Got it GOOD! guitar. Cron-eX holds JJ who is struggling. Jack winds up and brings the guitar down just as JJ moves. The Guitar shatters over his head and JJ takes his other guitar and attempts to hit Jack, but Jack dodges it and Ace grabs the guitar. HE takes it and hits JJ over the head with it. Then The Gambinos attack JJ and The Cat as Cron-eX comes to and helps them. The three of them leave.)

<font color=green>Cameraman:So,what is the point of that.How is past experience going to help you out here.

<font color=yellow>Jack:Hold up,I won the World title in the most dominat fed on the net,and I sure as hell will win the World Title here.

<font color=red>Ace:Wait,Jack,I got something to say.

<font color=yellow>Jack:Go ahead.

<font color=red>Ace:Well,I just want to say that my brother Jack will beat the hell out of everybody,and I will manage a World Champion.

<font color=yellow>Jack:Alright,fair warning.That's it.The Gambino's are done.Salu.Now,get the hell out of my house.

<font color=white>(Jack takes another sip from his glass.The cameraman gets up and walks out of the door and passes Jerry,who is still polishing the tire.He is cursing under his breath,and Jack yells for him.The cameraman gets in the van and it see's Jerry walk back out,his lip bleeding and his eye swollen.He shuts the door behind him,and flips the door off.The camera fades to a commercial.)
