<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Dread X:
[B]<font color=white><I>(The camrea fades in and it shows Dread X in his house. He is sitting down watching TV. it looks like an OWF show, Crag is on. Its his latest promo. Dread X watchs for a while. The promo ends and the OWF show continues. Dread X turns off the tv and sits up. He walks over to his fridge and the camrea man follows him. Dread X gets out a beer and opens it)

<font color=blue>[b]Dread X[/b]: Boy that Crag never learns.

<font color=white><I>(Dread X walks back to his seat and sits down. He takes a slurp of his beer)

<font color=blue>[b]Dread X[/b]: I mean what is he on? Yes Crag even though you are dumb I am <font color=red>[b]Normal[/b]</font>. Sure I was at the hospital, getting a check up! I had a knock and that can be expected in Pro Wrestling. I mean we are in a high quality fed and we keep it real. I do have to keep fit for our match on SNS, Dont worry im ok. No need for you to be worried there Crag.

<font color=white><I>(Dread X sits back and takes another few slurps of his beer)

<font color=blue>[b]Dread X[/b]: As I said we are in OWF and its tough. I cant expect for everything to be palin sailing. I think our match on SNS will be tough on us both even know we both have valid points on who will be the victor.

<font color=white><I>(Dread X puts down the can and walks away to another room. He signals the camrea man to follow him. He opens the door and walks in. Its his gym, Dread X lays out a mat and lays down on it. He starts doing sit ups. He does 10 then sits up)

<font color=blue>[b]Dread X[/b]: Gotta keep fit. You know how it is. Officals always trying to keep us ready. Anyway back to Crag. I think the Prez will make it Hardcore rules since we have been asking for it the past few days. The thing that struck me though, was what you said about our match. No actually Crag I dont think there is a chance I will die. Sure there is a possiblity I might lose, you being a big star and everything but im not ready for a coffin yet. 

<font color=white><I>(Dread X walks back through the door and walks back to the fridge. He gets some sort of sports drink and takes it with him back to his gym. He leaves it on a table and lays back down on the mat and carrys on with his sit ups. He does another 10 before sitting up again)

<font color=blue>[b]Dread X[/b]: Regarding your women. Indigo or whatever here name is. Keep here backstage because you know how these matchs can go!

<font color=white><I>(Dread X smiles an evil smile)

<font color=blue>[b]Dread X[/b]: So Crag if your still up for it, come down on SNS and bring your ass. I'll kick it good and hand it back battered and bruised!

<font color=white><I>(Dread X gives another evil smile before starting the sit ups again. The scene fades to black)[/B][/QUOTE]
