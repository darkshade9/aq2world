<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by shawnmatthews:
[B][A dance floor much like the one on Saturday Night Fever is seen, with flashing squares & multi colors of lights all over the building. The floor is jammed with people. The camera keeps moving closer to a guy sitting with his back against the camera, sitting on a bar stool at the counter of the bar. A bar tender is pooring him a drink, as smoke comes from in front of this man. The camera shows the bar tenders white skin, dark haired, shaven face.]

Bar Tender:That's your 10th drink tonight. You seem as if something was wrong. 

[The camera shows the man's face. It is the OWF's own OWF Matthew's World Champion, Shawn Matthews. *Kinda over plugged, huh?* Anyways, he sets down his drink after drinking a bit.]

Shawn:That is the dumbest question I have ever heard. Do you ever watch tv. I am trying to run a company of over 1,000 moronic workers. Either the ring crew needs money because they can't find there bolts, screws & nuts to put the ring up. Drunk wrestlers are wasting precious TV time. What am I suppose to do. I can't fire them for legal reasons. Plus if Al Gore wins Presidency he'll make that stupid law where every company has to have a employee from certain races or groups of people. So the OWF we'll have to keep Flash, because we need a mentally handicapped person.

[The Bar Tender laughs a bit.]

Bar Tender:Yeah, I did see his last interview on the TV. He is more boring then a 24 hour telivision marathon. How long will it take for you to beat him?

Shawn:If he actually has the guts to enter the ring, then I'll say 15 seconds. 3 seconds for the pin. 12 seconds for a kick to the gut & Light's Out. Then we'll be rid of that unoriginal gimmick & his horrible promos. 

Bar Tender:He was on your case pretty bad in that little skit he did.

Shawn:You think I care what he has to say. I would hate to sink to his level, by using child nick names, but if I were to call him anything, it would be a boring, jealous, no talented wrestler who is obsessed with human fecies. He says I'm scared to defend my title. I say I have yet to find a good opponent. Even though I decided to put my title up for grabs against Stewart Hix. Now, maybe Flash is right. Maybe I do need a good ass whooping.

[The Bar Tender, looks curiously at Shawn.]

Bar Tender:What?

Shawn:He's right, I do need one, but guess what. He won't be the one to give it to me. I won't ever suck his uni-nut sack & I will never get the shit beating out of me by him. Yes, I do think he's a rookie & life is a game. So technically I disagree with all the statements he said.

Bar Tender:What about Stweart Hix & him saying...

[Shawn Matthews cuts him off.]

Shawn:Oh, he's a comedian. He thinks he's the best athelete there is. He thinks I'm ugly. He thinks this, he thinks that. He can kiss my ass. He will learn at The Matthew's Extravaganza that I am the greatest OWF Matthew's World Champion ever in the history of this federation. Oh wait, I forgot. I am the only OWF Matthew's World Champion this federation has ever had. Since no one has beaten me for it. Also to win that title, I had to fight some of the toughest wrestlers around. So Hick & Drunk Flash should get there facts straight.

Bar Tender:So are you gonna go over & dance?

[Shawn looks over at everyone danceing. Then looks back at the Bar Tender.]

Shawn:I suppose so. Now camera boy, leave. You have earned your pay check & I don't want what happens next on TV. Thank you. I your President will have an article out soon for all of you.

[The camera goes black as Shawn starts getting off his chair.]
