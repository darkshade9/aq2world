  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">Ok, there 
   is something I didn't mention in the about section but is necessary 
   to mention before the rest is who exactly you are. Well there are 
   sides, I decided to leave them open ended and blurred the lines 
   because this isn't my RPG, it's yours. You also don't pick a side to 
   be on, you make friends, make enemies, and make friends enemies. Who 
   knows, through out the course of the RPG you and everyone else may 
   think that your side is the good guys, but then I go to the message 
   board, spice up the story a bit and now you are sort of wondering if 
   you are really fighting for what's right.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">As I 
   mentioned before, I play many characters, and I also play god. I warn 
   you, I will post things that will confuse you, but trust me, they 
   will make much, much more sense later.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="WHITE">Section #1: 
   How to create your character</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">Ok, so by 
   now you have read the about section and gotten the background so you 
   know a little bit about this RPG so thanks for coming here because 
   that means you have gone from curious to interested, so basically 
   that makes the purpose of this section to get you from interested to 
   player. So once again, let's begin at the beginning.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">The first 
   thing you need to do is pick a character class, now the great thing 
   about online real RPG's instead of Ultima or Everquest is the fact 
   you aren't limited as much, so your character class isn't called 
   character class anymore but rather your job. So that is the first 
   real thing that you will need to put on your character sheet. Oh, by 
   the way, you can check an example </FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="2"><U><A HREF="samplecharactersheet.htm"><FONT COLOR="WHITE">here</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">.
    So as you can see the job is only proceeded by your characters name, 
   sex, weight, height and age. All characters must start out under the 
   age of 20, that could be 19 or it could be 1, but honestly, it could 
   be pretty boring playing a one year old.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">That brings 
   up an issue, what's the point in a characters age height and weight, 
   well basically I don't like getting all deep into detail like weight 
   modifiers and stuff, it detracts from the story and experience, which 
   is what makes an RPG an RPG. So basically, like alot of other things 
   in this RPG, it is based on the honor system. For example, do you 
   think that a 500 pound man could leap a 15 foot fence? Probably not 
   on this planet. So think logically when you choose these options.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="WHITE"><FONT SIZE="3"><U>Master Skill</U></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">Ok, next 
   comes master skill. Master Skill is the thing that your character 
   does best. Everyone has all the skills listed below in some form, but 
   if you have one of these as your Master Skill you rarely fail at it 
   unless someone else has their master skill something that can counter 
   your master skill. More on countering below. Your master skills can be:</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">Infiltration-
    If you have this skill you can sneak places easily. The only way you 
   won't be able to do this is if, for example, post a message on the 
   story board saying that you sneak into a hotel, but someone who is 
   against you could respond to that saying that their master skill is 
   Intelligence, then you have been countered. More on countering below.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">Close 
   Combat- Close Combat is a good skill for you if you like to get into 
   fights alot in the game. If you like to do things with your body (not 
   that way perv) like karate, and other forms of hand to hand combat 
   this is for you.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">General 
   Weapons- General Weapons gives you basic knowledge of all major 
   weapons except sniper rifle, and how to use them. You can use 
   pistols, machine guns and other guns to use.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">Sniper- 
   Sniper is a rare trait because the only people that can hold a sniper 
   rifle are the people that have it as their master skill, you may not 
   hold or use a sniper rifle if it is not your main skill.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">Demolitions-
    If you have this skill you can use bombs whenever. Of course, bombs 
   come with consequences, accidents and people stopping them, but you 
   can blow things up easily, this is one where creativity from you and 
   the rest of the players really can make the game exciting.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">Intelligence-
    Ok, let's get this off the plate right away: you don't use weapons. 
   That's right, you don't really get to use them at all, if 
   intelligence is your master skill you get intelligence and a bit of 
   close combat. That doesn't mean that your character is weak, though, 
   the thing that makes your character one of the, if not the, most 
   crucial part to the story, is that, in one way or another you can 
   counter every single other major skill out there, or get the 
   opportunity to counter everyone. You can disarm bombs, find out where 
   snipers are, use security cameras and other smart methods to find out 
   if someone is infiltrating a building. But that isn't all, besides 
   countering you could help people, by doing things such as telling 
   your friends where snipers are, supply your buddies with weapons and 
   other things to help out their missions or help one of your 
   infiltrators by hacking into the system and watching the security 
   cameras to alert him of any approaching security guards or other 
   enemies. So as you can see, if you are an Intelligence guy, you may 
   not be in there on the action but you can sure help alot of people out.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">Ok, the 
   point of a master skill is you know it so well that you rarely do 
   something wrong, but this wouldn't be a very fun game if you could do 
   your master skill all the time. I like to force creativity, and 
   counters does just that. I am going in a few seconds, give you the 
   guidelines, but it is what you do with these guidelines that makes 
   the counters so much fun to use. Below I will list the Master Skills 
   and what other Master Skill can counter it. Here is the list of Counters</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">Ok, now 
   those are the counters. I guess that's it on master counters. Well I 
   will try to go a little bit more in depth. Here's a little example:</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">Lets say 
   that your master skill is infiltration. You are trying to sneak into 
   a building. There is one guy on the story message board that doesn't 
   want you to have this succeed for some reason. His Master Skill is 
   Intelligence. He could make up a story about how his character was in 
   the building's security system room. He sees the Infiltrator on the 
   security camera. Now the Intelligence guy could get some of his 
   friends to go into combat with the infiltrator.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">Now that 
   was an extremely simplified scenario, that could go for 25 threads 
   about how the Intelligence guy had trouble getting into the building 
   and lost a little health, but this brings up a topic:</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT COLOR="WHITE">Master-Counter
    Theorem #1</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">: If 
   someone makes something happen and the thing they made happen wasn't 
   brought up before it is engraved in history and cannot be changed.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT COLOR="WHITE">Corollary</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">:
    The person that makes this event happen cannot bring up things to 
   help his characters stats, only story related things.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">So what 
   this means is once the Intelligence Guy got to the security camera 
   place, no body can master-counter that action. The character should 
   not be punished for making a creative action that adds to the story. 
   But also they cannot reward themselves for this. (e.g. On my way to 
   the security room I found 24 AK-47's and am handing them out to so 
   and so) That can't happen. But if a person does come up with a good 
   idea they could very well be rewarded by the board moderator.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

   Weapons category. The battle you just won took 10 threads (messages

   formula you would take 2 times 10. That gives you 20 experience 
   points for your General Weapons experience points. This also 
   subtracts 20 experience points from your opponent. This can be all 
   from one skill's experience points or split up among different 
   skills' experience points. It doesn't really matter, as long as your 
   opponent looses 20 experience points. Also, once you have won the

   the battle system is you will probably think &quot;wow, that's 
   stupid, it's just so simple&quot; but basically, that's what I was

   you haven't heard me say anywhere else: Characters don't die in 
   battles. The only place a character can die is on the story board and 
   the only person that can kill a character is the person that controls 
   that character. Basically what that means is when you are sick of the 
   game you come up with a way for your character to die and put it in

    This is the easiest part, you post a message on the Story Board with 
   the subject being Battle Challenge. You find some way to relate the 
   story to you challanging someone to a battle. You can make this a 
   direct challange to a specific character or open ended. Or request an 
   NPC battle. If you want an NPC battle you must specify what NPC you 
   want to battle. One way or another, someone has to respond to your 
   post before you start the battle on the battle board. The response 
   doesn't need to be much, it could be a simple: I accept, or it could 
   be a more intricate way of saying I accept. The purpose of the 
   response is to let the person who started the battle know that you 
   know about the battle.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

    Then you are wondering, if you can't die in battles, then how do 
   battles end? Well the first person to run out of AP is the looser. 
   Nuff said. Well not quite enough. Ok, remember that Master Counter 
   thing from a while back? Well you know what I'm talking about but 
   don't know it exactly, well here it is again:</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

   that you did except is more limited. Your opponent needs to react on 
   your action, by using the table above. So instead of deciding what 
   skill your opponent would prefer to use, your opponent needs to go by 
   the counters above. Battle Step 2 is really important, your opponent 
   and you need to have a logical explaination for using the counter. 
   You can't just say &quot;I am using the General Weapons skill because 
   the table says I can counter with it.&quot; You need it to make 
   sense. Give an in depth story at how you did this, the more detailed 
   you are the less unneccesary aurguments there are about &quot;if that 
   was legal or not.&quot;</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
