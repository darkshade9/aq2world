   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">Well the 
   above really says it all...well not exactly. Ok, this is basically an 
   intro to the RPG game without the rules, so you can get a feel of 
   what this site is and what we do here. Well let's begin at the begginning.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">Basically, 
   I am sick of having to monitor my online rpg's constantly, and most 
   of my online rpg's have failed. But I tried over and over, to see all 
   of them fail. So what I did instead of taking a new idea and just 
   making a regular RPG for it I decided to step back and look at what 
   screwed up all the other rpgs. The main thing that ended up ruining 
   all my other rpgs was the fact no one could make it to chat rooms at 
   the same time. Then I tried to fix that with message boards, but that 
   was way to much work for me to do, and I had to limit the amount of 
   members, and alot of members didn't participate. So a while back I 
   thought, what if I could create the setting and let them do all of my 
   work? haha, no way. But then I was talking to someone on ICQ and I 
   figured it out.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">Basically 
   what you do is make your own webpage that has your character sheet on 
   it and instead of me doing all the work on your character info, you 
   do it. Then there are message boards, many of them. There are 5 
   boards for each topic. The reason for 5 boards per topic is for 
   levels, the higher experienced people get to go to better message 
   boards, where they can do more things.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">So then 
   there is the two main boards, the story boards and the battle boards, 
   the names pretty much explains them all. If you want to work with the 
   story you go to the story board of the level your character is at, 
   you roleplay with other people and you can use everyone's characters 
   in the story, but the rules and regulations of how you can use other 
   people's characters are explained more in the rules.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">Another 
   thing different about this kind of RPG is you can just jump in at any 
   time that you want to. All you need to do is go to the rules, read 
   them over and create a webpage for your character, something as 
   simple or elaborate as you want it to be. Once you have this page 
   done you go to the story board, see what's going on and hop in, 
   adding your personal touch to the story. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   <FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE="2">That's 
   pretty much it for the intro of Under Fire, now time to go to the 
   rules so you can learn how to play!</FONT></FONT></FONT>
