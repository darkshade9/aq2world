<p>I�ve spent quite a lot of time taking a look into the world of the cheat and anti-cheat groups, I hope you find this interesting!  Most of this column is entirely from my own perspective on cheating and cheats.
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Cheating On/Offline</span>
<br>
<br><span style="font-style:italic">Offline - Single Player</span>
<br>
<br>How many of us have cheated on offline games?  I&#39;d say 80% of us have tried some sort of offline single player cheat.  I not talking the full-blown wall and aim hacking experience, just the usual immunity, unlimited ammo or even the ways to skip through levels.
<br>
<br>Those of us with any quality will of course complete a game on skills alone and then perhaps mess about with invincible mode or such like cheat options (after all the game coders placed the cheats within the game!).
<br>
<br>Even if you considered this type of cheating bad/wrong the only person being cheated in single player is the player him/herself.
<br>
<br><span style="font-style:italic">Online - Multi Player</span>
<br>
<br>In my opinion any form on cheating while playing against other people while they don&#39;t know your cheating is completely wrong and reserved for the least
<br>intelligent and most attention deprived players, after all if you don&#39;t have the skills - why cheat?  Does it make you a better player?- No. Can you become a pr0 player? - No!
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">The Cheat0rz</span>
<br>
<br>I think you can slot cheaters into a few different categories, 
<br>
<br><span style="font-style:italic">The n00b cheat</span> - This is a total newbie or someone who just cant grasp the whole taking time to learn route, they run in a mad craze killing any thing
<br>that moves.
<br>
<br><span style="font-style:italic">The average cheat</span> - This Smuck cheat has played CS for a while but doesn�t have many skills, they are still obvious cheats (they can�t help but headshot
<br>everyone and look through the walls).
<br>
<br><span style="font-style:italic">The skilled cheat</span> - This is of course the most deadly and most annoying cheat, this could be one of your clan mates, your best mate, absolutely anyone!  This person has good CS skills and also the discipline to move in non-obvious ways, they don&#39;t use over the top headshots and aiming, the word subtle is a perfect description.
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">What is Cheating?</span>
<br>
<br>Now isn&#39;t that a good question.... After taking a look around through cheat forums, anti-cheat forums and asking people options on those forums I&#39;ve come up with the following:
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">0% Cheating</span>
<br>
<br><span style="font-style:italic">Utility Scripts:</span>
<br>
<br>Its seem most people do not regard this as a form of cheating just simply a lazy players tool, they can buy your weapons, warning if you about to throw a flash and perhaps give you team attack/defence instructions (Eg. ** Rush Site A! **)
<br>
<br></span>Normal Custom Models:</span>
<br>
<br>Usually regarded as a modification to how your game looks and in fact may even lag your game more and so putting you at a disadvantage.
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Grey Area Cheating?</span>
<br>
<br><span style="font-style:italic">Function Scripts:</span>
<br>
<br>This is perhaps a controversial area mainly because people&#39;s opinions are so deeply divided.  
<br>
<br>One group of players claim they are simply a more advanced Utility script for the lazy players. (Eg. Selected a HE grenade and throwing it at a touch of a
<br>button).
<br>
<br>The other group claim it&#39;s a form of automation at a functional level. (Eg. Press Key &quot;r&quot; and you do a double sommersault, turn 180 degree, strife left
<br>and aim at cheat level and burst fire for 5 seconds), and so is a form of cheating.
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">100% Cheating</span>
<br>
<br><span style="font-style:italic">Cheat Custom Models:</span>
<br>
<br>These models are some times used by cheats to make it easier to see you! (Eg. Dark maps like de_prodigy - they use bright white models so you can be seen in the shadows).
<br>
<br><span style="font-style:italic">Team Chat:</span>
<br>
<br>Probably one of the most used cheating methods where players think they aren&#39;t actually cheating!  This happens when a clan/group of players are all
<br>using a voice program such as Roger Wilco (url) to communicate with each other, which is fine until the dead team members start telling the living team members where the enemy players are, that&#39;s pretty much the same as wall hacking and often looks like wall hacking to a spectator!  The same applies to LAN players.
<br>
<br><span style="font-style:italic">Cheat Script:</span>
<br>
<br>Now were down to the nitty gritty, this is the real out right champion of cheats, a cheat script/add-on is usually a small download which is an easily installed to your pc and is designed for one sole purpose, to make losers seem like winners.
<br>
<br>These scripts offer a range of automated skills and unnatural powers, some of which are:
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Wall Hacks</span> � Give you ability to see through walls or see where other players are and what weapons they are using.
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Aim Hacks</span> � Lets you select which part of the body your bullets will hit without you aiming! It even offers auto aiming and random hit zones (Eg. 2 shots chest then 1 head).
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Server Exploits</span> � Help cheats gain access to rcon (server admin) or exploits that crash the server.
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Jump Hacks</span> � Allowing you to jump continually and higher/faster than anyone else.
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Speed Hack</span> � They can move anything up to 100 times faster than you!  If they used it openly you wouldn�t even see the enemy!
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Auto Shoot</span> � Automatically shoots you enemy as specified in the aim hack, you just walk and do nothing else!
<br>
<br>These are the main types of hacks available to anyone and people wonder why CS is filled with paranoid prone server admins and players?
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Why Cheat?</span>
<br>
<br>These are the voyages of the cheat team n00bie-prise our continuing mission to annoy strange new servers to seek own new victims and new communities to haunt, to boldly cheat where no one has cheated before.
<br>
<br>The answers are always simple with these small-minded people, they seem to want one of 3 things:
<br>
<br>1. People praise them and ask them to join their l33t clan, telling them what a great player they are.
<br>
<br>2. To annoy other people to laugh at them knowing they can�t kill them and can�t do anything to stop them.
<br>
<br>3. They actually believe that they don&#39;t really cheat they have real skill in fact the cheat doesn&#39;t really work and they are really quite good players after all look at their score!
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Make them STOP!</span>
<br>
<br>How can we defeat these cheats?  Perhaps the simplest answer is we cant :-( while there is someone willing to spend their time coding cheats they will
<br>always be around and no matter how many cheat detection systems we get, the cheat coders will always find a way around them.
<br>
<br><span style="font-style:italic">Valve Anti Cheat (VAC) - Valve Software (<a href="http://server.counter-strike.net/server.php?cmd=VAC" target="_BLANK" class="pagelink">http://server.counter-strike.net/server.php?cmd=VAC</a>)</span>
<br>
<br>Valve&#39;s attempt at ridding the world of cheats, although initially we all had high expectations VAC has been disappointing, the updates are not regular enough and cheat coders seem to easily code a by-pass.
<br>
<br><span style="font-style:italic">Cheating-Death (CD) - United Admins (<a href="http://www.unitedadmins.com/cdeath.php" target="_BLANK" class="pagelink">http://www.unitedadmins.com/cdeath.php</a>)</span>
<br>
<br>CD is currently regarded has the best cheat prevention/detection method, rather than focusing on detection they focus on disabling the ability to
<br>cheat, for example making wall hack in-effective.
<br>
<br><span style="font-style:italic">Half-Life Guard (HLG) - United Admins (<a href="http://www.unitedadmins.com/hlguard-dl.php" target="_BLANK" class="pagelink">http://www.unitedadmins.com/hlguard-dl.php</a>)</span>
<br>
<br>This little number is quite effective and has been around for probably longer than any of its peers, it started off as CSGuard originally coded my
<br>OLO. The only downsides to this method is it works in a similar way to VAC were it searches for specific cheats which makes it slightly easier to code
<br>around. Another downside is it uses lots of CPU - but overall its definitely a great tool and unlike VAC the Admins at UA&#39;s work very hard to keep it up
<br>to date and are continually improving it.
<br>
<br><span style="font-style:italic">Baseball Bat (BBB) - Pissed off Players (tm)</span>
<br>
<br>This method seems to be the only sure fire way to stop cheating but unfortunately its illegal in most civilised countries.  It involves a group of
<br> hard nut thugs visiting cheaters one at a time and giving them the well known knee breaking therapy which usually cures the cheats� anti social behaviour. 
<br>
<br>While there are many other cheat detection tools these are the 3 most popular but as all of them will tell you it�s an uphill struggle, the old Good V Evil scenario. 
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold"> Part II</span>
<br>
<br>In part II you can expect the results of my cheat experiment and my interview with the well known cheat coder Joolz.

<p>Here&#39;s the 2nd of my interviews!
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Interview 2 - OLO - Creator of AMX, CS-Guard and statsme to name but a few!</span>
<br>
<br>Quick Bio -
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Name:</span> Aleksander Naszko
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Sex:</span> Male
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Country:</span> Poland
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Web:</span> <a href="www.olo.counter-strike.pl" target="_BLANK" class="pagelink">www.olo.counter-strike.pl</a>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: So Mr OLO do you still play online games?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: Nowadays only Counter-Strike</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: What was your first online game?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: My first online game was QuakeWorld.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: What coding languages do you use?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: I write my mods for HL in C/C++. However I can code in many languages.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: When did you starting using small?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: When I wanted to show AdminMod community that StatsMe can be used with their favourite tool. I had to write some examples for them and this was the first time I have written plugins in small.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: What was the first thing you coded in the early days?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: This was PLBot for Counter-Strike. I found it very funny to do since it was touching AI, which always fascinated me.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: Do you code anything for games other than HL based?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: No I don&#39;t. I had neither chance nor time for more coding. Also to code something you must first find out what are a community needs.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: When did you first realise your software was becoming popular?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: I think that it was with first release of ClanMod. I received a nice feedback then. I got a good support from german community which helped me in future development.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: Do you love what you do?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: I used to <img src="https://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.actiongames.co.uk/actiongames/smilies/grin.gif" height="15" width="15" alt="">. I have just learned coding in C/C++ with HL. Every new program provided me some place to check my knowledge and improve my coding skill. Currently I&#39;m a bit bored with stuff I do. From ClanMod till AMX almost all based on the same scheme and all was written in C/C++. To change it recently I wrote CmdX which gave me some opportunity to learn perl basics.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: Do you ever get to work directly with valve - have they ever offered you a job?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: I&#39;ve never worked with valve and they have never offered me a job.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: Do you think we can ever eradicate the &quot;cheat&quot; from gaming?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: I don&#39;t think so. Writing cheats is like hacker job and there are always some people who like to do it and there is a lot of people who like to use cheats.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: You&#39;re currently working on amxmod <a href="www.amxmod.net" target="_BLANK" class="pagelink">www.amxmod.net</a>, how did it get started?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: Well, I thought about making StatsMe 3 with better scripting abilities, but finaly this idea became a tool for general modifications known as AMX. The choice for scripting language was pretty simple. This was Small because a lot of admins was already writing in it and Small SDK provided all needed examples for implementation.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: Whats been the best/worst times with it?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: Best times... Every day when people are happy with AMX Mod. I would like to thanks dJeyL without whose help AMX wouldn&#39;t have so big/great community. Worst times... Bugs in releases which have to be tracked and removed.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: Whens the next offcial release of amxmod?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: Generaly the final AMX Mod is ready. I have no more ideas for AMX Mod. There is a beta available on AMX Mod forum. I&#39;m waiting for some documentation from other people, because I lack in time and also documentation in english is not my best side.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: You are well known for many things, are there any projects that people don&#39;t know that you are involved in?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: There are no other projects.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: What project has been the most exciting to you? - and what do you do when you get de-motivated/bored?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: Most exciting were probably bots. When I get bored I often take 2 weeks without computer, after such period I&#39;m full of power. I look then around the community and read what are the people needs.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: Is there any advice you can give to people who would like to follow in your footsteps?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: Well, I like to be a productive person rather than a consumer. So if you have some ideas and know how to materialize them then share your work with our community.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: Thanks for you time OLO <img src="https://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.actiongames.co.uk/actiongames/smilies/smile.gif" height="16" width="16" alt=""> and now time for our quick fire questions!
<br>
<br>Fean0r: HL2 or DOOM3 
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: HL2</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: Athlon or Pentium
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: Pentium</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: Linux or Windows
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: Linux</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: Cheatz or Skillz
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">OLO: Skillz</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: CD or HLG

<table width="100%" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tr><td class="newsday">&nbsp;My interview with United-Admins (UA)</td></tr></table>

<p>I had decided to dedicate time every week to adding regular news to our site.  I was browsing through various well known CS sites and then like a flash of useless inspiration I thought it would be interesting to get a chat with some of the well known members of the CS community!
<br>
<br>Well this is the first in a series of interviews I have planned (and done ;))
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Interview 1 - Vampire - Chairman and PR Director of the United Admins Board</span>
<br>
<br>Quick Bio -
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Name:</span> Ben Wagner
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Nick:</span> Vampire
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Sex:</span> Male
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Country:</span> Born in England but have been living in Germany for the last the few years. 
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Web:</span> <a href="http://www.unitedadmins.com" target="_BLANK" class="pagelink">http://www.unitedadmins.com</a> <img src="https://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.actiongames.co.uk/actiongames/smilies/smile.gif" height="16" width="16" alt="">
<br>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: Lets start at the beginning, whats the first online game you ever played?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Vampire: I started playing Half-life online</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: Whats MOD&#39;s do/did you play?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Vampire: I started with TFC and moved to CS mainly for LANs. Also dabbled in most other mods available but mainly for testing purposes, of all mods I&#39;d have to say the old TFC is still my favourite.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: I have to agree with you there TFC has alway been my favourite.. Do you still play it as much?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Vampire: I don&#39;t really have time for online games these days.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: No TFC or CS!.. lol do you play any games offline?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Vampire: I like to play CM4 and Republic but have much time for that either!</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: I suppose all your time is invested in United Admins <img src="https://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.actiongames.co.uk/actiongames/smilies/grin.gif" height="15" width="15" alt="">
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Vampire: Pretty much</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: How did you get involved there?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Vampire: I started off as a translator and then moved to the PR team.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: What languages were you translating?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Vampire: I was doing English -&gt; German, German -&gt; English translation for a while and was later involved in running the translator team.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: UA seem to have gone from strength to strength where did it all begin?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Vampire: It was founded by HoundDawg and redphive at the end of March, 2002. We have since expanded as a community and an organisation to become what we are today.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: I know OLO was behind lots of your work in the early stages is he still involved these days?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Vampire: OLO hasn&#39;t been part of UA for a long time, although he recently showed an interest in rejoining the clanmod team at some point in the future.  We still talk regularly to discuss IP related issues.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: UA is perhaps best know for products such as Half-Life Guard (HLG) and Cheating-Death (CD), where do you think the future of cheat detection lies?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Vampire: Greater integration and cooperation with game developers, our work with PTERODON is just one example of this</span> 
<br>
<br>Fean0r: For the readers UA are in the process of developing a new Anti-Cheat product for VietCong. The new VietCong AC team will be working directly together with PTERODON, the developers of the VietCong game. (<a href="http://www.vietcong-game.com/" target="_BLANK" class="pagelink">http://www.vietcong-game.com/</a>)
<br>Fean0r: What about games like Half-Life 2 do you think it will be better guarded against cheats?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Vampire: That depends on to what extent game developers are prepared to work with specialised organisations and the community</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: Yea.. I suppose its difficult to keep pace with cheaters as they seem to be getting more and more advanced?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Vampire: Yes it has long been the case that you need individual teams to keep
<br>track of cheats and the cheat community..</span>

<br>
<br>Fean0r: Have your ever cheated yourself, other than in testing?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Vampire: Nope, I never really saw the point.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: Do you have any contact with known cheat coders?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Vampire: I&#39;ve personally spent quite a bit of time talking to Joolz lately, although never when he was part of UA. We talk about the gaming community in general and compare notes.</span>
<br>
<br>Fean0r: lol I&#39;d love to see some of those conversations, to finish off if someone has the time/money/skills to help UA what can they do?
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Vampire: People with the time and skills should definitely consider joining us. Beyond that we&#39;ve setup a page which lists ways to support UA: <a href="http://www.unitedadmins.com/about-support_ua.php" target="_BLANK" class="pagelink">http://www.unitedadmins.com/about-support_ua.php</a></span>
