<p style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:bold;">A little history..... By RobbieBoy</p>

<p>3 July 1999</p>

<p>The Newbies Niche goes live...</p>

<p>Back in July 1999 The Newbies Niche was born, and went online.  The project was not entirely planned.  A guy named David Blackburn worked for Planet Online (now Energis Squared), he posted in the POL (Planet Online) Quake2 NG, asking for help with a project.</p>

<p>Dave wanted to make a games portal for Quake, Quake2 and some other games that were out at the time, several people raised their hands and said they were interested, myself included.</p>

<p>A mailing list was set up for these people to bounce ideas around at each other, well, it didn't take long before that had all fallen to pieces, the guy who seemed to try and take charge got rather shirty with everyone, and stormed off in a huff.  After that just about everyone else dropped off too.  I said to Dave that I'd happily do something for him, but that I was no artist, and my webby skills were still in their infancy.</p>

<p>I tried to get Dave to 'tell' me what needed doing, but he really wanted me to come up with something, finally, after lots of emails, he said to me, why not write some guides for Action Quake2, as you play that a lot.</p>

<p>I took on his challenge!</p>

<p>POL already had a small site for AQ2, nothing flashy, just a few files, and a couple of links, nothing really to help anyone get started with the game.  I figured this would be a good place to start.  Within a few days I already had several pages of stuff done, a crappy logo (I did say I wasn't an artist), and some helpful bits and bobs.  I started asking in the Quake2 NG if anyone would care to help me with the project, as things were starting to take off, and people were already visiting the site.</p>

<p>The first person that worked for The Newbies Niche, other than myself was Tragedy Trousers (Erik), Erik really helped me out with getting some guides done, I had put a few things together, but he took those much further and really made them work.  The next member of staff, albeit rather casually (as he had his own site to work on), was Optrex (Mike), Mike was a great inspiration to me, and we soon became very good friends (although he wont admit it).  Mike put together the original LAN guides for us, which were a great addition to the site.</p>

<p>After this came -Robbie-, who offered to do our artwork for us.  After many, many emails from me to him, and him to me, we finalised what we wanted, and the artwork has been there ever since, buttons, logo's you name it, -Robbie- did it..</p>

<p>Things were really taking off now, within the first 3 months of the site being online we'd had just over 10'000 hits!  I couldn't believe how well things were going.</p>

<p>Things took a small turn for the worst now, I fell out with David Blackburn's right hand man, after we'd had some problems.  The site was still being hosted at POL, and when I needed things doing, they weren't getting done, I was told that it wasn't 'important', so, I got a little pissed off.  I'm probably well known for it to be honest, but I made a rash decision, and bought a domain!</p>

<p>I was in discussions with Mike for about 2 days trying to decide on a domain name for the site, we'd toyed with TNN.CO.UK and The-Newbies-Niche.Co.Uk, neither of which we really felt were quite right.  I decided that I didn't want the domain name too specific to just the one site, so, finally, actiongames.co.uk was born!</p>

<p>As soon as the account was set up, I emailed Dave and said my thank you's and my goodbyes, but not before transferring ALL of our pages, images, and downloads to the new domain :D</p>

<p>With the new domain set up, a few links were changed, NG's were informed, and once again the hits were rising.</p>

<p>A further addition to the site was the purchase of the UBB (Ultimate Bulletin Board), it wasn't cheap, but I felt it would be a good asset to the web site, allowing more interaction between the people using the site.  The originally Discussion Zone was born around the end of October 1999, and boy was it used!  Although there wasn't a huge some of members that registered on the Discussion Zone, the ones that did used it a lot!</p>

<p>At this point I was still into playing AQ2 quite regularly, and had joined a clan called MRE, the clan soon came to its end and joined with another clan called RAF, becoming MAF.  As fun as it was, I wasn't overly happy, and felt it best to leave.</p>

<p>I had been toying with the idea for sometime, and finally decided to form a new AQ2 clan related to the web site.  Clan TNN was born.  I wanted to create a clan that was not for the elitist AQ2 players, not necessarily for people with low pings, and good skills, but for the Joe Bloggs AQ2 player, the player who doesn't play so well, the player with the high ping, the player that needs to have some fun and meet some new people, and make some new friends.</p>

<p>Maybe my ambitions were aimed to high, I don't know, but it didn't take long before we were recruiting.  TNN had never been a 'you can join if you are good enough' clan, the idea behind it was to leave it as an open clan, probably one of the only clans to actually do this.</p>

<p>As our members grew, we tried to do several things to make playing organised games more easy.  The initial idea was to have smaller squads of around 5 players, who would then play other squads of 5 players within the clan.  The squads were supposed to be not made up of all good players and all players, but just a mixture of people to make games fair, and fun.</p>

<p>Not many people seemed to like the idea, and it was soon dropped - like a hot potato.  I think it was about this time that I lost a little interest in running the clan side of TNN, we were creeping slowly towards 30 members, and with everyone having their own opinions and views, it got increasingly difficult to keep things calm and organised.</p>

<p>Moonman (Warren) was the next member of the TNN crew to join. I had unfortunately run into some *big* Real Life problems, and I had to get them resolved, in doing so, I sold off the majority of my computer equipment, and had to stop working on the site for some 6 months.  Whilst I was away, Warren to charge of the site, and the clan, and indeed did a fantastic job. How Warren managed to find the time and energy to organise the TNN clan I'll never know, he was certainly the best man for the job, organising clan friendlies where he would literally just sit and watch the matches, taking the scores etc, whilst not playing himself.</p>

<p>After about 6 months I returned to the site, not really knowing what to do, I was still paying for the hosting of the site, and felt I'd like to do something still with it, but at the same time felt I would be stepping on Warren's toes by working here again, after he had kept things going so well.</p>

<p>I tried to contact Warren many times to work something out, but, as I'm sure you all know, something when you write emails to people, the things you say don't always come across the way you meant them, and I do believe I may have seriously pissed off Warren, for which I am truly sorry.  We kinda both realised it wasn't going to be possible for us both to work together on the same site, as one of us would change one thing, and the other one of us changed something else, which lead to complete confusion!  Warren agreed to stay on at the site and run the TNN clan solely, I agreed to run the Niche, and we worked well together and got things done.</p>

<p>Rincewind (Chris) also signed up for duty at Actiongames/The Newbies Niche, and became our resident Discussion Zone administrator, he had been taken on whilst I was away, and no doubt I trod on his toes too!  Sorry mate...(I'm really not as bad as I sound in this!)...Chris did/does a great job of a) calming me down, and trying to prevent me from posting sarcastic replies to people and b) ensuring the Discussion Zone runs smoothly, making archives and so forth..</p>

<p>GingerBloke (Stuart) was now also employed at Actiongames/The Newbies Niche, Stuart was running the downloads side of the site when I returned, and he was working on some automation code that would speed up the maintenance of the downloads section, adding new files and so on, again, another great asset to the site, and in fact he is now the proud owner of it.</p>

<p>Whilst all of this was going on, I was keen to get more games sites added to the main Actiongames portal.  The first of these sites was a Quake site, Peter started this for me, and I think aimed it to be along the same lines as The Newbies Niche, where the site was designed for people who were just picking the game up, and needed help.</p>

<p>Another site was added by another Mike, who created our Quake2 site...</p>

<p>Peter and Warren added the Unreal Tournament site to Actiongames, and thing were coming along nicely.</p>

<p>The problem I found was that we literally just didn't have enough people working for us, and as we have no financial backing, we couldn't afford to pay people.  Everything that was done at Actiongames/The Newbies Niche was done by volunteers, for which I am eternally grateful.  Since day one everyone who has had anything to do with Actiongames/The Newbies Niche has shown nothing but interest, and ideas for the site.  Many people have also contributed to the sites, whether it be buy working on them, creating images, guides, running sections of the sites, or helping with the general administration of it all, to you I owe you a lot - so heres a big thank you.. :)</p>

<p>Many things have happened during my time with Actiongames/The Newbies Niche, and I have now, as you all now, handed things over to Stuart, who I am sure will take things to the next level, and only make things better at Actiongames.  I will be around still in the background, and always open for a chat via email if you want to stop by, but for now, from me to you, its a goodbye, and farewell...Thank you to all of our visitors and supports...</p>

<p>Sincerely...</p>

<p style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:bold;">And of course the future. By G.Bloke</p>

<p>I've of course got plans for the future, but not all plans always work out. I want to pull together a decent set of sites that will be reguarly updated and will provide some of the best resources. I want players to come back week to week because they want to be part of the community here. The crux of this plan is visitor contributions, from suggestions to columns or even providing guides, files or information for the sites.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/actiongames/about/contact.shtml">Contact me</a> if you can think of a way you want to be involved. Or alternatively use the Discussion Zone to leave suggestions and ideas. If you like the site, then tell your friends because at the end of the day this was created for you.</p>
