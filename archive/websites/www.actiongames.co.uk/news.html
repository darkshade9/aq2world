the site up and looking so good. Lets hope the site is a great
success. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Upcoming on Actiongames is
the Quake site which is due to open shortly, and there are plans
for a Unreal Tournament site to be hosted here in the near
future. Check back here soon for more details. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">All is not lost...</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">A number of people have
risen to the challenge of running the actiongames.co.uk site in
the absence of RobbieBoy and now Optrex. The Action Quake site's
future has been secured, the Quake site is due to be launched
soon and having spoken to Mike I believe that his sites are still
going to hosted here. It has already been decided to split the
cost of the domain between a number of volunteers and so this
site is secure for at least another year from November.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Having said all that, we
still need volunteers to run/assist the sites here. Mike has
stated that he would keep the frontend of the entire group
together (the bit you are looking at now) but he may change his
mind yet.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">So if you want to help or
have anything to ask you can email Mike at:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Ok, hello all, I have
found out that Optrex is not going to be taking over
actiongames.co.uk site, so this site will be down eventually, so
if one day you find this site is down go to</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">http://gamersniche.cjb.net
(this site is not currently up, so do not try it)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have the money to
pay for a domain, but I will try to get a server to host us with
no pop up ads. I will scour the net looking for a place to host
us, but do not worry, since no body is taking the reigns of this
whole thing we have here, which I beleive could be something
great, I will take charge, but I am not willing to shell out alot
of money, as robbie was.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Also, we need more people
to work on sites, so if anyone is interested just email me at:</font></p>

<p><a href="mailto:PSX_Mike@hotmail.com"><font size="2"
face="Comic Sans MS">PSX_Mike@hotmail.com</font></a><font
size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">, or you can e-mail me at: </font><a
href="mailto:wixmmm@yahoo.com"><font size="2"
face="Comic Sans MS">wixmmm@yahoo.com</font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Also, my stuff is:<br>
Yahoo! ID: wixmmm<br>
AOL SN: wixmmm<br>
ICQ: 33605198</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Feel free to add me to
your list. Also, if you know nothing of HTML I can send you files
of the old Quake 2 site and the PSX site to use as templates
until you get more comforatable with HTML.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Also, I would like to
comment that I will no longer keep the name
&quot;actiongames.co.uk&quot; as our name, I have decided to go
with the 'niche' thing that Robbie had going. So for example, the
PSX site is Playstation gamers niche, and the Half-life site will
be the Half-Life Gamer's Niche and the whole site is called the
gamer's niche. I am working on getting someone to do a logo, if
you are interested, just do one and I will choose it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">I have also decided to
stop the Quake 2 site and leave it how it is until some one
decides to take the reigns of that one, you can use all the same
files, and I am more than willing to explain to anyone how to
upload files to the internet if you are interested in doing any
one of the sites. Also, if you have any ideas on how to make this
site any better e-mail me.</font></p>
