<p>Without them then there wouldn't be a site, that's right, computers.....no
I'm joking, this is my way of thanking everyone who has made it all possible. Most of all my thanks
goto the visitors. Everyone working at actiongames does so without pay and so their time is valued very highly.</p>

<span style="font-weight:bold">&nbsp;Rincewind&nbsp;</span>
<p>
Chris has before now been given the official title of my right-hand man, that might give a clue as how valuable
he is to Action Games. I value his opinions highly and often bounce ideas off him, thankfully not all of them
bounce back, saving the site from some of my half-baked ideas. He runs the Discussion Zone at Action Games and
does a brilliant job. Also a good friend.
</p>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">&nbsp;Smurphster&nbsp;</span>
<p>
Smurph is from the states and we met through the AQMD which he took over running a while back. Although his curent involvement is limited to news on TNN we have discussed several new AG site ideas including a DoD site which he will probably run.

<span style="font-weight:bold">&nbsp;RobbieBoy&nbsp;</span>
<p>
I really don't know where to begin praising Robb, he was the original founder and owner of actiongames.
I met him through the <a href="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/tnn">TNN</a> website which as an
ActionQuake player was my bible. When the <a href="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/tnn">TNN</a>
website needed a new home he purchased the Action Games domain and created the Action Games collection of sites.
Unfortunately, for a few months in early 2000, he was forced offline due to 'real life' issues which affected
the forward growth of Action Games, but it never died. Recently Robb decided to move on from Action Games so
that he could give more time to his new projects. As his successor his original ideas for the
<a href="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/tnn">TNN</a> site are what I hope to build upon in the
future for Action Games.<br><br>
I still consult him for ideas and opinions and to some extent he still works on the LTK Depot at
<a href="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/tnn">TNN</a>. I see Robb as a good friend and wish him
all the luck for the future.
</p>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">&nbsp;Ted (aka EvilTed, aka Tedium)&nbsp;</span>
<p>
Ted created the old logos and design for actiongames and I think you'll agree he did a good job. Hes is still responsible for some creative input and also nags me into getting work finished.
</p>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">&nbsp;Blitzkrieg&nbsp;</span>
<p>
Blitz approrached me to do work on the CS site and I was happy to have him. He left us for bigger things because I was too slow in getting the site upto speed. So sorry about that Blitz and have fun on your new site.
</p>

<p style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:bold;">And many, many more....</p>

<p>If I were to list every single person who had in some way contributed to Action Games
then the list would be pages long. I want to thank everyone who has contributed something, small or large towards
Action Games. In particular the following:<br>

<p style="font-weight:bold">
_Robbie_<br>
Optrex<br>
After_[8]<br>
Japes<br>
Moonman<br>
Flyboy<br>
Wixmmm<br>
