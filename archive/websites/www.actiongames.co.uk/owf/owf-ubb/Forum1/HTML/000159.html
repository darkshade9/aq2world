</FONT><HR>(The screen fades in to the sight of the outside of a bar.  A guy is thrown out into the parking lot he is really blasted.  You can tell he has no idea where he is.  Somebody helps him up off the ground to a nearby bench.  He lays down on it and goes to sleep.  The camera goes into the bar.  Music is playing loud and people are yelling.  Their is a fight in the middle of the room between two husky guys in flannel.  The camera goes back to a seat in the corner where Crag sits having a drink.  The woman from his house the other day is sitting beside him.  They appear to be having a good time as they are laughing at the drunken fighters. )<P>Crag:  You guys will go anywhere to get a story.  Good Work.  You should see about a raise from the Prez.  I supposes you want thoughts and such.  The fans have done it again, helping me out when I needed it most.  I said that it all would even out in the end and it did.  You gave me a good match Scotty and i have to respect you for that as a wrestler.  Now you get a chance to get back on track by attempting to beat the Russian again.   Enough about are northern neighbors.  Where do i go from here.<P>(He drinks from his mug of beer.)<P>Crag:  I've noticed a few new guys coming in to the OWF.  Talented to say the least.  I have noticed one guy  in particular whom I like.  He is a man much like myself.  His main goal is to get respect from his peers.   And most importantly he is 100% American.  In case you cant figure it out im talking about Trey Slim Stevenson.  I like the way you think and would like to step in the ring with you on the Surge Card next week.  Not for a match in which to hurt on another.  But to put on a good show for the fans, and all others.  By the end i will have your respect and you will have mine.  From what I have seen from you, I will have no problem getting a response from you.  Hopefully the response I will like which would be an acceptance for my challenge.<P>(He drinks a little more.)<P>Crag:  Unfortunately Slim is not the only new guy.  I man who particularly annoys me is frkizoid.  He just sounds dumb ive never seen him before and he already makes me want to choke him.  Jekel should get a purple heart when he beats up this first class idiot.  Who else particularly makes me want to choke them to death.  Kaos does this too,  he demands a title match because he one two matches.  People now a days don't understand that you have got to pay your dues to get to the top of this game.  What's next pretty soon we will have people making debut heavyweight title matches.   Hopefully some of the new guys coming in will have some sense.  Their are a few here now but not enough the future hopefully will bring some good workers to the OWF.  We got to go now so see you soon.   God bless America.<P>(Crag and his girl get up and exit the tavern.  Who is this woman, maybe we will find out soon.  The screen fades to black.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana">IP: 216.111.221.241</font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="90%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><P>All times are CT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000159&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000159&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
