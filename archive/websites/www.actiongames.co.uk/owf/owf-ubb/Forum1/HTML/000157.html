</FONT><HR>(((The camera fades into Angel's house... A chair is in the center of veiw.  Someone is sitting in it)))<P>???????: Well, thank you for visiting my new house.  I kind of like it.  Angel was a fool.  I told him exactly what he would receive if he joined me.  I told him that if he followed my directions all this would be his.  Is all this his?  Well it was.  It was up until about 5 minutes ago when I had to...do a little punishing to my former friend, and servent.  Look at him...it's pitiful.<P>(((The camera pans over and Angel is seen lying on a bed, bleeding with a halo cut into his stomach, deeper than the cut he used to have weeks ago)))<P>Don't get me wrong.  Angel deserved it.  He babbles on and on about how I am the madman...no no no, that would be him, if you only knew the problems this man has.  I have worked so hard to try to fix the problems, but when he left me I said "what's the point" and decided to show him just how stupid he was.  I don't know if Angel will survive this...he sure is loosing alot of blood over there...no one can save the crazy man now...too bad, he was a good student, he showed real promise...I guess that means I will need to undertake a new apprentice...someone who will do whatever I say and follow the eternal plan...the plan that will change everything, the plan that truly will control your lives.  <P>Angel, oh my dear Angel, why have you forsaken me?  You knew that I had more power than you would ever have, you knew I can see what you wouldn't, but the thing that really gets me is that you knew that in time you would have what I have.  I planned for us to be equals, you control me and I control you, and at the same time we can learn to control ourselves.  We have problems, Angel, we were supposed to get through them together, you were SUPPOSED to do as I said!  I am not a powerhungry man, not at all, but when I put everything I have out there, and share it with someone, and the person I put all my trust and faith in just walks out and leaves everything I have tought him, and on top of it says I have it wrong...well that is just sick of you, and you deserve everything that will happen to you.<P>Angel: (blood in his mouth...) Y-Y-Yo-You s-sound g-ga-gay.<P>???????: Angel, shut up, you have no idea how easy it would be to make that cut deeper.  Now Angel...why can't you just come back, you have one more chance, I will let you, I know you have made some mistakes, butif you just come back and follow me, we can finish the plan together.<P>Angel: Never, I will not join you, you lost the vision, you don't deserve the vision, you aren't what you think.<P>????????: No Angel, you really dissapoint me...that cut will be deeper, or better yet-<P>(((Bloodshed walks into the room, at first he doesn't see Angel lying on the bed, cut up)))<P>Bloodshed: Yo Angel, beotch, whadup, what we doin-  Holy shit man!  Who did that!<P>Angel: Bloodshed!  Leave, don't come back, it isn't safe, he's mad I tell you, mad!<P>Bloodshed: Hells no man!  I gosta help you!  You're my dog man, that's what we do, we help each other, let me go get some gaus man...holy fuck!<P>Angel: He's over there!  Don't go by the chair!  He'll do this to you also!<P>Bloodshed: Dude, there is no one in the chair!<P>Angel: FUCK!  He got away!  Ok, it's safe, now help me!<P>Bloodshed: Hold on, let me go get some stuff.<P>Angel: Hurry man, I'm loosing Blood!<P>(((Bloodshed walks out of the room...the camera goes black...minutes later the camera comes back on, Angel is gone...Bloodshed walks into the room)))<P>Bloodshed: Oh shit!  Angel!  Where the fuck are you man!  This ain't cool of you!  OH god damns...I gosta call someone on this!<P>-End-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana">IP: 148.233.111.232</font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="90%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><P>All times are CT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000157&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000157&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
