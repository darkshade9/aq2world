</FONT><HR>*As the fans settle down in their seats after viewing multiple performances and angle progressions, the lights fade to a blood red, as an instrumental version of Dreams in Digital, by Orgy begins to blare over the PA system. Fireballs then begin to erupt all over the arena, as streams of electricity follow closely behind them. The spectators leap to their feet, awaiting the arrival of an apparent new comer in the OWF. But as they wait their anticipations begin to overwhelm them, causing them to burst into cheers and applause. Finally, after what seems like hours of waiting, White letters form on the giant video screen. They read, “Your Savior is the light… I am, ultimately, the dark…” Those words then fade to red, and run off of the screen, like dripping blood. Then in their place appear the words; “I am the Prince of Darkness… You are my court… Revel before me…” After several seconds, those words run off of the screen in the same manner that the others did, yet no words take their place. All of a sudden, a pre-recorded track begins to play over the arena…*<P>Valek: My return is nigh, and my reign is inevitable… My stay shall be indefinite, but as long as I am here… You will call me Master… For I am the Prince of Darkness… I am Darkness incarnate… I shall not be denied of what is rightfully mine… The OWF…<P>*As the track begins to run, a large, lanky man appears from behind the curtain. He is clothed in a trenchcoat, as his long, wavy black hair covers is pale complexion. As he makes his way to the top of the ramp, two other huge men follow him. As the fans get a closer look, the tall front figure can be seen clearly. He is Valek, the Father of Anarchy, and the Prince of Darkness.  Why he has returned is beyond anyone’s guesses. The three men stand at the top of the ramp, with Valek a few feet in front of the other two. He then raises his arms up and throws them down quickly, causing flames to erupt all around the ring, stage, and ramp. The three men then make their way down to the ring in unison, as they then slide into the squared circle. Valek then grabs a mic, and tosses it to one of the other men. The man with the mic has long, white hair, and fairly tanned skin. He has a stern look on his face. He raises the mic to his mouth, and then begins to speak.*<P>Corinth: I am Corinth, alias Neo. My business here is undecided, yet I know that this is where I am supposed to be. For several weeks now, my brother’s presence, or mine has not been seen, for we quit this petty excuse of an entertainment business, searching for a better life. What we found was persecution and hardship. Those that persecuted us despised the fact that we had left our supposed “home”, and finding a job locally was not a simple task when you stand seven feet tall, weighing well over three-hundred pounds. What we did find though, was a place and feeling of refuge with our new Master.<P>*Corinth then hands the microphone to the other mysterious figure. The other man stands several inches taller than Corinth, and appears to be much more muscular. He has long red hair, with black highlights and a tattoo of a red star over his right eye. He slowly gazes around the arena, before speaking into the microphone.*<P>Ephesus: I am Ephesus, alias Darklander. As my brother stated, our business here is yet undecided. We shall go wherever the winds blow us, but as for now, we hail here in the OWF. I have a feeling, though, that the .ORG championship is in my near future… Marasmus… I shall deal with you in the days to come, but as for now… I shall turn this over to my Savior… Rescuer… And Master… Valek…<P>*Ephesus then hands the microphone to Valek, who then raises it to his lips, and smirks… He then begins to speak.*<P>Valek: Michael, I’m back. I wish to speak to you, so why don’t I cut the “dramatic” return, and make my way back to your office? I will, but first, I’d like to ask you a question. Do you remember these two? They don’t quite remember you, but once I show them what you’ve done to them, I’m sure it will jog their memory. So, Michael, you’d better have the papers ready when I arrive at your door, because if you don’t, there will be hell to pay.<P>*Valek then drops the microphone, and leaps the top rope. He walks up the ramp, as Corinth and Ephesus soon follow behind him. He leaves without any music, pyro, or electricity, which makes you wonder what he’s up to…*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana">IP: 194.164.6.82</font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="90%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><P>All times are CT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000183&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000183&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
