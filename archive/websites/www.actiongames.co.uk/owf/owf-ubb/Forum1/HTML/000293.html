</FONT><HR>(Crag is shown sitting in the hot tub at his house.  The hot tub is  underground, and he has a drink sitting on the ground beside him.  He has on black swim trunks which can be seen through the  bubbling water.  He looks very relaxed, but yet very intense.)<P><b>Crag:</b>  It seems that my popularity continuously grows with the fans yet the superstars still do not see the light and very few have the rocks to fight with me.  Most who do end up on the wrong end of a three count.  To this point in my OWF career i have beaten <i><b>Mr. Tokyo</i></b> the current hardcore champion.  I beat him twice and look where he is now.  And seems a bit backwards usually people beat someone and use them as a stepping stone but in this case i beat him and now he is a champion.  Fighting against me shows that people deserve where they are.  I've also beaten Scotty Hinton who no doubt has had opportunities since our  match.  Helping people is something i like to do.  But not these kind of people.  Tokyo is tough but he is not somebody i am proud to have made famous.  <i><b>Scotty Hinton</i></b> is just a whiny little bitch.  He walks around and calls himself impeccable constantly but yet i have beaten him one on one and in tag team matches.  Hinton is another guy I helped become famous and am not proud of it.  Lets see what i have done in the last week that is worth wow. On Saturday I beat <b><i>Jack Gambino</b></i> in a back lot brawl a match he will never forget.  That scar that represent the 50 states will be with him forever.  Every time he hears about the 50 states he will think of the ass beating i gave him.  When he has kids one day they will ask him where the big scar came from and he will have to tell them “Well kids your daddy got his ass beat by Crag the greatest wrestler to ever represent the United States.”.  His kids will possibly be proud of him because I will be a World Hero in the future.  I was really happy to hear that the OWF had signed the new deal to go World wide.  I cant wait to go to these European, and South American countries to showcase my great skills.<P>(He climbs out of the water and dries off with a towel that is near by.  Indigo enters the door from outside he kisses her, and she continues into another room.)<P><b>Crag:</b>  Last night I sat down in my study room where i go when i have a worthy opponent.  A room i have not used in sometime.  I thought to myself “what is next?”.  After hours of thinking i got a sudden urge.   I was sitting on the thinker relieving that sudden urge and  <b><i>Jake Keeton</i></b> came to my mind.  A man that claims to be “The Future”.  I say the future is now.  I am challenging you right now to a match on Saturday Surge,  i looked over your bio and seen that your style is amateur.  So i say ill not only give you the opportunity to fight me in a match where no punches or kicks are allowed but I will also not make it a match for your .COM champion.  That catch is that if i beat you then the next week on the same show Saturday Surge we fight for the title in a match of my choice.  Which means whatever i can come up with basically.  You still have the advantage in this match, because amateur is not my style and even if you lose you still do not lose your title.  Its kind of like a best of seven series and you already have 6 wins, I have to beat you twice in a row.  This is an offer you cant refuse.  Don't keep me waiting Mr. Future.<P>(He walks off into the other room, the cameras fades into a shot of an Eagle flying through the sky  then  the screen fades to black.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana">IP: 194.164.6.15</font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="90%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><P>All times are CT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000293&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000293&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
