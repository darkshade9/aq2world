</FONT><HR>[This what took placew last night, at the begining of the TNT show]<P>Barry Barlett – Well fans, we are just about to start off the show with a great match, this one is just….<P>[The lights dim out, and softly Night crawler by Judas Priest begins to play.]<P>Johnny No-Good – What is this…? He is not scheduled now… did I get the wrong notes again?<P>Barry Barlett – No, I don’t have him out here either… What’s the date today?<P>[The two announcers exchange papers to see if they got the same notes to follow today’s show.]<P>[Dream walks out from behind the curtains.  The crowd cheers a bit, but then remembers to boo her and Night crawler and so they do.  Dream looks at them in a funny way.  She looks behind her, and Night crawler appears from behind the curtains, Dream leads the way to the ring, while Night Crawler is closely behind.]<P>Barry Barlett – Well these are the right notes… Night crawler is just not on here… what the hell is this about?<P>Johnny No-Good – It better be good, we got a packed up show for tonight, and I don’t want to miss any action because Night Crawler hasn’t got around to cutting promos at his own time.<P>Barry Barlett – Well they are just about in the ring, damn that music is giving me the creeps!<P>[Dream climbs up the stairs to the ring, she enters the ring under the top rope.  Night Crawler stands in ringside, grabs the top rope, and steps up to the apron. He then steps over the top rope and enters the ring.<BR>Dream grabs the microphone from the ring announcer.  Night Crawler paces around the ring like a caged animal, Dream stands in the middle of the ring waiting for the crowd to calm down from their massive boos, and for the music to stop.  The lights bright up again, and she begins speaking.]<P>Dream – Saturday night.  Night Crawler has proved to the world, that when he means business, he means business.  And tonight will be no exception.  Saturday, Night Crawler beat, no cross that, Saturday night Night Crawler, DEFEATED, Angel.<P>[The crowd boos]<P>Dream – Oh you all know it.  The bottom line is this, you may have seen the last of Angel, this time for good.  Night Crawler did the job that should have been done, long time ago.  Angel, a few weeks ago, you pretended to be dead, well now:  Reality bites, you may just be that!<P>[The crowd boos]<P>Dream – You know it’s true!  Angel’s days in the OWF are over.  The proof is that he will not show today, tomorrow, next week or even next year.   Not as long as Night Crawler is around!<P>[The crowd does what it does best – BOO]<P>[Dream looks at the crowd disappointed]<P>Dream – You just don’t get it do you? Whatever nimrods…<P>[Before the crowd can even understand what she says, she keeps going]<P>Dream – the last thing you saw Saturday Night on Surge, was Night Crawler being the last man standing.  Well tonight, not only he is the first man out here, but he will indeed will be the last man standing tonight!<P>[off camera the commentators speak]<P>Barry Barlett – Once again… I don’t see him having a match tonight… is even in the card?<P>Johnny No-Good – I have no idea.<P>Dream – You see, After defeating Angel, Saturday Night, myself and Night Crawler came to the conclusion that something had to be done about wrestlers, who think they are high and mighty because they got a piece of tin around their waists.  They think since they have a title on their shoulder, they can be no shows.  Well all that is about to change.  We are here to show you, the moronic fans…<P>[The crowd boos]<P>Dream – Shut the hell up and let me speak<P>[The crowd screams out their boos, Dream waits for them to finish… but she keeps on waiting almost forever… She finally give s up and continues over their voices]<P>Dream – As I was saying, before you idiots in New York interrupted me…<P>[The crowd boos again, and Dream just looks frustrated]<P>Dream – You see…. [The crowd quiets down] … You see, looking at today’s upcoming matches, I see a three way match for the OWF “.COM championship”.  Well...  That match is set, and Night Crawler is nmot going to be a part of that. Oh no… While that match is slated to be later this evening.  We are going to treat you fans to a match for the .COM championship, right now!!!<P>[Off Camera]<P>Barry Barlett – what in the hell is she talking about?!<P>Johnny No Good – I think they are laying the challenge now…<P>Dream – You see, Crossbones [The crowd cheers].  Crossbones, you haven’t been around here lately, now I saw you coming into the arena tonight, and hell you have gained a few good pounds since we last saw you.  So Crossbones, Night Crawler is going to do you a favor tonight.  You see, Crossbones.  You have disappointed everyone by winning the .COM championship, so tonight.  This man [pointing at Night Crawler] is going to disappoint you.  Because right now, you are going to step out of the locker room, and you are going to make your way into the ring, and face the lord of darkness, you will face Night Crawler right here, right now!!!<P>[The crowd cheers, knowing very well Crossbones is a man of honor.  He will except the challenge and he will be out here any second]<P>Dream – oh and if I didn’t make myself clear, tonight, you will put the title on the line, right now, and after Night Crawler finishes you.  He will go and defend that title later tonight against Dread X and Lowell Dotcom.<P>[Off Camera]<BR>Berry Barlett – This is huge!!!  Night Crawler challenging Crossbones, right here right now!<P>Johnny No-Good – We got to take a commercial break now?!  What?  What the hell… we’ll be right back.<P>Berry Barlett – And hopefully will have a match at hand!<P>[Commercial break]<P>[The scene returns from a commercial break, seeing Night Crawler waiting in the ring and Dream beside him.  There is also a referee in the ring.  The crowd waits.  Crossbone’s music begins to play.<P>[The match begins]  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana">IP: 194.164.6.15</font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="90%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><P>All times are CT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000242&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000242&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
