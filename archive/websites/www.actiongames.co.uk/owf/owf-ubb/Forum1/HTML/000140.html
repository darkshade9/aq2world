</FONT><HR>((Bloodshed is punching a boxing bag, in the gym, training as hard as his body will allow.  Sweat drips down in a downfall, and the bag seems ready to burst.  He rests for a bit, and looks at the camara.))<P>Bloodshed:  Two days before SNS, and I dont have a match.  Odd for a man as my self,who likes to fight so much.  So i want a match for Saturday, and it'll be simple, a regular match, and I know my opponent already.  DirtyRussian. Why i chose u? ha. Because u said u were part of my robbery, part of the bank asault.  But why did u hid like a little bitch? Why didnt u come down and take the police like a man? Or are Russians used to being cowards? Dont get me wrong, i have nothing agaist Russians.  And i dont want no fucking money either.  I dont care about money, i care about beating humans to a pulp. About Bloood, and about making people shed it horribly, hence my damn name.  So DirtyRussian, before u accept, know this...All i wanna see is that if u are good, if u can make accusations like u have, and if u wont run up and hide in a fuckin vent like little pussy ass bitch that u seemed to be...So, accept or decline, i dont care, but this is for my trusting u.  <BR>And Hinton, u gay ass queer, I DO hate canada, that place aint even a fuckin country, but im adressing u now because i dont want u thinking shit like {in girly voice}"oh Bloodsheds cool, hes against the DirtyRussian, Bloodsheds my bestest buddy!"  Cause i aint and aint neva gonna be muthafucka! And im dissin the DrityRussina cause he talked some shit bout my past... So now that thats settled... <BR>Angel...u little muthafucking bitch...im gonna rip ur fucking head off and shove it down ur throat then im gonna....<BR>Just kidden man!!! WHUT UP brotha! how ya been angel, long time no see, no hear, no speak, no nothin.  No but seriously., whats gon on in ur hood, Angel? everything good? Aight, that what i like to hear bro.  But partner, when we's gonna really have a match together? u see how we brutally murdered team 2 on Survivor? damn muthatfuckas didnt stand a chancce gainst u an me...they just kept fallin to da...Angel and Bloodshed Duo? Fuck if i know what we called...Fuck if we even got a name...Dont matta...But anyways, we did good on Survivor, and we's gotta fight together sometime, get that damn Tag belt, u know pardner? But cant bee on SNS, i's got a match, DirtyRussian willing.  Unless i kick his ass in 2 seconds and i aint too tired, i coujld prob go for another match...but doubt hes gonna be just some pushover...<BR>Naw, shiat nigga, good to have ya back on my side, good to have ya back Angel...yo man i's got an idea! Hows about it u an me go to a strip joint to celebrate ur return? U know get some women, some dances, some booze, could invite the Prez and some other wrestlers too? Whatta say? well u get back to me on that one...But all in all, its great to have ya back bro!<P>((Bloodshed then gets serious, and he looks away form the camara, looking towards the side of the gym.))<P>Bloodshed:Saynt Saynt Saynt....whered u come up with that name,Jack? Is it a witness protection alliby given to u by the FB-fucking-I?  Well, good to see u've resurfaced...and loks like u have a twin, Marasmus...hes a good man, a lot better than his brother.  U know something, Jack? I've always wanted to ask u some questions ever since that last day at court.  Why d u do it? WHyd u sell out? u were my most trusted partner man, and u sold me out to the cops...Shows a lot about people these days...Did they give u millions? did they give u fame, fortune? what man what, what could they give u that made u sell out ur best friend? U a fucking disgrace, u inhumane worthless shithole of human life.  Jack...i got nothing more to say to u...all i know is that u havent seen the last of me, u dont know what the Alcatraz has made me into...locked up in a gray room, no steel bars, but a steel door.  I was never allowed any human contact for 10 years, except during luch hours, for 10 years.  I trained my mid, my soul, my fists, to be ready for u, to exact my revenge...And now, very soon, that time grows closer to u Jack, that time seems longer and longer to me, but it keeps getting closer...THe jail, the time i served seemed like an eternity, and that is what u are going to be feeling...nothing but eternal pain rushing through all the nerves in your meakly body.  But ur time will come Jack, Saynt, and i will wreak my vengence finally after so many years...<P>((His eyes glow an eerie red, and he returns to silently beating the hell out of the punching bag, as if it were the hanging soul of Saynt.  Slowly, the camar focuses on Bloodsheds reflection off a pane of glass as it goes balck a second later.))</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana">IP: 148.233.41.210</font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="90%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><P>All times are CT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000140&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000140&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
