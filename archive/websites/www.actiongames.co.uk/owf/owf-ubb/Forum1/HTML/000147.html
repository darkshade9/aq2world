</FONT><HR>(marasmus is in his locker room, and is just about to leave a house show, where he defeated a local jobber. as he is removing the tape from his wrists, the camera gets closer. he begins to talk, without lifting his head to look at the camera)<P>MaRaSmUs: well, for the past week or so, i have been a little bit on the quiet side. well, ive been healing my wounds, and right now im at about 75%. now, i notice the prez has given me a match for tomorrow, and its for my newest won title, the .Org title. and then there's the new VP. and he goes and decides to swing his weight around, and give kaos a title shot on TNT. hey, you know what? i dont have a problem with that. im a champ, and im supposed to defend my titles, like a fighting champ would do. so its totally ok that the VP seems to not have taken too much of a liking of me. he can go make all the matches, all the contenders, all the stipulations he wants. hell, ill accept EVERY single one...all i expect in return is MY fair title shots. i will represent the OWF proudly, and i will defend it against anyone from any fed. OWF is goin to the top, and imma be there to help guide it!<P>(he finishes with his wrists, and raises his head to the camera)<P>MaRaSmUs: and, now that mark blaze is out of this conversation, i can move on to other subjects. normally, if any of you pay attention to what i say, i dont bad mouth people to often. i often have alot of respect for everyone, and thats what i usually get back. but, when someone pulls something that is as heartless as faking a death, i HAVE to say something. while im not a big friend of angels, i dont want him dead. i dont know what kind of sick mind he has, but to me its just completely heartless to go out, in front of millions of fans, and fake a death; cause millions of people to be sad, some even cried. while i wasnt reduced to tears, a few were and i feel that is horrible. so angel, i just want you to know, what respect you had from me is gone. i dont think a match will solve anything, but if you want to get in there and mix it up with me, then fine, we can do that. but i no longer respects a man who has such little respect for others to pretend to die. just though you might wanna know that. <BR>Now, i move onto another subject, in the from of my brother. saynt, i see our tag-team match has been postponed, but worry not. we will get in there sooner or later. but not today, SNS or even TNT... it seems im gonna have to take care of some buisness on those dates, in the form of blaze and kaos. speaking of blaze, i havent heard a peep from him! i sure hope he decides to show up on SNS. so blaze, gear up man...you're gonna get your shot at this!
