</FONT><HR>[Shawn Matthews is seen sitting behind a desk writing on a piece of paper. In front of him on the desk is a name plate that says "OWF Matthew's World Champion Shawn Matthews" & beside that is another name plate that says "OWF President <S>Mike</S>", then written in marker underneath <S>Mike</S> is "Shawn Matthews". Shawn has on what appears to be an Armoni suit, and a rolex watch. Shawn looks up at the camera.]<P>Shawn:Hello, I am the OWF like it or not Matthew's World Champion Shawn Matthews. As OWF Matthew's World Champion it has come to me that our President is doing an awful job at his job. I mean booking wrestlers in horrible matches without any further warning. Making unkind remarks about his OWF Matthew's World Champion. Letting rookie wrestlers with big mouths run their big mouths with out any punishment what so ever. All these things tell me, probally the same thing all you fans are thinking right now. We need a new President. <P>[Shawn has his famous ear to ear grin on his face.]<P>Shawn:That's why I, your OWF Matthew's World Champion decided it is my duty & in your the fan's & wrestler's of the OWF best interest if I got us a new President. So I decided to find a new President for us. After thinking about it since last night after our worst Saturday Night show ever, I have came to a conclusion. The new President should be someone who is honest, pure, clean & has an Armoni suit. <P>[Shawn points to his suit.]<P>Shawn:So this is why I decided to elect, none other then our OWF Matthew's World Champion to be the new President.<P>[Shawn lifts up his name plate that states him as President.]<P>Shawn:Now as President I would like to take away some of the horrible things that happened as of late. I first have decided to sue both Marasmus & The New Model for harrasment to there new President. I am also going to strip The New Model of his title. Also because I like Mikey so much, I have decided to keep him here working in this federation for me as a janitor. Wait, I apologize. Mike you are now not a janitor, but a custodian. <P>[Shawn smiles & lifts a pair of coveralls from underneath his desk that have a name tag saying "Custodian Mike". He tosses them to the side.]<P>Shawn:Now Marasmus, don't think you'll be getting away so easy from punishment. Your not only going to have to face my lawyers, but you'll have to face me. Marasmus I want you Saturday night in the main event. Since that's obviously where I belong. Now Mars Bars, this match will not be hardcore, this match will not have an weapons or blood. This match Saturday will be yours & my favorite, a regular clean wrestling match, because there is no Hardcore in OWF. Now this is the part your gonna really like. Mars, I am going to put the one thing you want more then anything on the line. I am going to put up my, um...<P>[Shawn grabs a pen out of one of his drawers.]<P>Shawn:I am going to give you this $75 pen if you can beat me.<P>[Shawn has another ear to ear grin on his face, as he sets the pen down.]<P>Shawn:I sure hope you didn't think I would give you an OWF Matthew's World Championship shot. Your just not that good yet. Now New Model since you won that little hardcore match Saturday that I wasn't involved in, I will not punish you any further. Might I add I have went down to our Record Office & taken out all proof that says I was in that match. So it now states that it was a one on one Hardcore match with Marasmus loosing to New Model. <P>[Shawn smiles once again, but just a little smile.]<P>Shawn:Now there are two more things I must deal with. One being Flash. Flash your a mumbling, gimmick stealing, pathetic, worthless waste of this companies money. You can claim all the titles you want, & how long you have worked in this business. I can gauruntee you though, that I have held bigger & better titles, such as The OWF Matthew's World Championship. I have held titles in federations that had over 100 great wrestlers. You on the other hand have probally held 2nd ranked titles in federations that couldn't even make the FWLNET top 1000 federations. Plus, I am the current OWF Matthew's World Champion & last I checked the OWF is one of the biggest & best federations going. So I guess that makes me better then you. As for all your awards & titles you held in big federations like the CCW, well hahahhahahaa. The CCW, if that's the same federation I remember, & I'm sure it is if you were succesful. It was a WCW rip off, with the succesful wrestlers being friends of the President. Well here in the OWF, it never was like that. Since I'm the OWF Matthew's World Champion & I hate the Ex-President. Also for some odd reason, I think he feels mutual. Also now with me as President it's gonna stay that way. No ass kissing or **** sucking allowed. So I guess there goes all your hopes of becoming succesfull in this federation, since I hear you were pretty good at both of those. Mostly the second one though. So now as President of the OWF & as the guy who is gonna kick your drunk ass Tuesday, I am demanding you to start being sober or quit wasting good OWF TV time on worthless drunk statements such as the ones you have made directed to me. We can not allow people to waste OWF TV time on slurred speech, non understandable promos. We just can't allow it. Now you worthless drunk, I will have mercy on your pathetic body. I will let you go free without an ass kicking if you don't show up Tuesday & I highly suggest that. I am The OWF Matthew's World Champion & I didn't get that title by sitting on my ass & not wrestling. <P>[Shawn shuffles through some papers.]<P>Shawn:All of these are bills of TV time used for promos. We just can't allow drunks to use it up. Now onto my last problem I have to deal with. The cocky, arrogant Stewart Hick. Now Stew, lemme let you in on something. YOU SUCK! You walk around this federation opening your huge mouth and talking as if you were The OWF Matthew's World Champion. You dared to call me second rate. You opened your big mouth stating I don't defend my title enough. Well guess what Stew? I am not afraid to defend my title. I challenge you to the next Pay Per View for my OWF Matthew's World Champion. I think it's called Hell or Highwater, or something like that. Anyways, I'll change the name later to The Shawn Matthew's Extravaganza. So at the Shawn Matthew's Extravaganza I will fight your ass in a regular, clean wrestling match. Though, I will have 5 referees to make sure no one interferes. If someone does & takes out all 5 refs, I will just strip you of the title & give it back to myself. Now Stewart Hick, you cocky, little arrogant son of a bitch, what do you think of that? Now camera guy get out of my office!<P>[Shawn throws a pen at the camera. It shuts off after it gets hit. No it wasn't the same pen that is on the line against Marasmus. Wasting a good $75 pen like that would be stupid.]<P><BR>For all of you with time, please give me your honest oppinon. Don't just write down 1 because you hate me. <br><BR>How do you rank my e-wrestler? <br><BR><form action="http://www.fwlnet.com/cgi/ewrestler100/ranking.cgi" method="POST"><BR><select name="score"><BR><option value="10">10- The very best!<BR><option value="9">9<BR><option value="8">8<BR><option value="7">7<BR><option value="6">6<BR><option value="5">5- Not too bad<BR><option value="4">4<BR><option value="3">3<BR><option value="2">2<BR><option value="1">1- Terrible!<BR></select><BR><input type="hidden" name="member" value="206"><BR><input type="Submit" value="Vote!"><BR></form><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana">IP: 194.164.6.15</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#000000">
