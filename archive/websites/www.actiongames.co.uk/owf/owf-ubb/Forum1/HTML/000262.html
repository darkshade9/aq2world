</FONT><HR>[Shawn Matthews is seen in red surfer shorts, with his messed up hair & awsome tanned body & abs, walking down the shore of a Califonia beach on a sunny day. As the camera shows the usual head & shoulders view of Shawn, he starts to laugh & then starts to talk again.]<P>Shawn:Man, I've never got such a response. Our hypercrit president is mad at me, Marasmus isn't to happy with me & Flash, well he's just a rookie with a big mouth. Little Mikey, you think your a big shot with your little articles that put people to sleep & your big ideas that you always screw up. Mike your so scared that you have to hide behind some little skinny reporter named Jimmy Kage? Mike, how much are you paying this idiot to make you look good? To tell you the truth, he really is doing a horrible job. Saying I am a thorn in your ass. Well if that is the case, this thorn has been pushing your fat ass around & getting all your work done. This thorn is the only thing keeping this now horribly worsening federation a half ass federation, only so his OWF Matthew's World Title stays an honorable title. <P>[Shawn has a huge grin on his face from ear to ear as he says "OWF Matthew's World title".]<P>Shawn:Mentioning of the title you allowed me to name after our first & only World Champion, me. Johnny Cage, or what ever his name, said you were going to address my title. Well little Mikey, if you want your fed to stay decent, then the only thing you better say in your speech about my new title, is how your going to pay for a new belt since this one dosn't say Matthew's on it. That is just one thing that really has been bothering me. Anyways little Mikey, you better tell your little reporter Bobby, that I don't think I have more power then you. No, I know I have more power then you & you know so too. Also Donny, you over paid, horrible reporter. The title is called the OWF Matthew's World Championship. I currently hold it & am the only wrestler to ever hold it. Think you can remember that?<P>[The camera zooms out showing Shawn bending over & picking up a rock & skipping it into the ocean. The camera zooms back at his head & shoulders.]<P>Shawn:There goes one little rock, blocking my path of keeping my federation strong. Now onto addressing another road block, another thorn in MY ASS! Mars bars. No not the candy, the wrestler. Mars, are you really, really wasted? I mean you seem like you've smoked & drank a few to many. You try & put me down, as if you were better then me. <P>[Shawn laughs for a few seconds.]<P>Shawn:Sorry, just thinking about Mars being better then me is funny. Anyways, you wanna know why I don't defend my title every damn show. There's two reasons. One if you see to much of a good thing, it won't be good anymore. So we can't show to many matches of me, or I might start to get as boring as your promos & that's something we don't want. This second one you should pay attention to Mikey. You don't book Superstar main eventers against, how can I say this nicely? Not jobbers, no not loosers, but less talented wrestlers, who really don't deserve a shot at your champion, me. See there is no reason for me to face everyone in this federation, since most of them suck. Now if someone showed that they were a great wrestler & deserved a shot at the OWF Matthew's World Championship belt, I would gladly defend it against them. I just don't see anyone that has proven themself worthy of wrestling me for the OWF Matthew's World Championship. Not you Mars Bars, or this flunky rookie, Flash. Now Mars, don't go crying that you haven't had your chance to become big either. If you would have beaten me in our match, you could possibly be holding the OWF Matthew's World Championship. Though if I recall, you lost that match to me. See I then went on to beat even better wrestlers & eventually win the OWF Matthew's World Championship. Also don't call me a coward or say that I'm hiding from you, because that will get you a non title match with me & an ass kicking from me as well. See the reason I don't give you a title shot, is because like I said. Your technically the worst champion we have right now. Out of our 4 champions your ranked 4th. Plus I've already beaten you. So why should you deserve to face me? <P>[The camera zooms back showing Shawn's whole body walking on the beach & suprisingly, there is another rock laying in front of him. He throws this one, except it dosn't really skip. It just splashes & sinks. The camera zooms back to his head & shoulders view.]<P>Shawn:Another road block goes away. Now since the last thing I stated before my lovely splashing rock, was how Mars is a worthless wrestler. Now onto another worthless wrestler I get to face thanks to a worthless president who thinks he'll be funny & book me in the begining of a card. What an idiot. Anyways, onto Flash, who is truly a waste of my time. Ahh yes, Flash. He enters out with Enter Sandman & a can of beer. Hmmm, I know I've seen this done before. Then bores me to death like every other wrestler. DAMN YOU MIKEY! DAMN YOU! Mikey you will pay for booking me against this worthless wrestler who didn't even pay enough attention to my last promo to call my title by the correct name. Just to let Flash know, the title is now known as the OWF Matthew's World Championship. Now Flash, the President didn't know what he was doing when he booked our match in the opening of the card, since I don't belong there & your name dosn't belong beside mine. Now you Bad anale mother beeper, your not going to beat me & your not going to even wrestle me. What's probally gonna happen is you'll take a crap in your little rookie tights & be to scared to come out and wrestle me. So I will win by forfit. Now as much as I would love to comment on the rest of his lovely interview & usage of words & comments about a my female dog that I didn't know I had, I just really can't. I mean Mikey, you gotta forgive me. You gotta get me out of this match. I mean if I beat this guy up, it's gonna ruin my reputation. People are going to get the wrong impretion of me. I mean me fighting this guy is like a father fighting his 2 year old son. It's just not right or fair. This guy has no chance unless he tries to give another interview like that & bore me untill I fall over asleep. I just can't wrestle him, title or non, I just can't do it. <P>[The camera zooms back showing Shawn's whole body walking on the beach. He stops & starts looking for a rock to throw. Once he notices there is none around, he looks back up at the camera. The camera zooms in.]<P>Shawn:I swear I can't even get a good prop manager for my promos. Anyways, I have another great introduction for you. Yesterday I introduced the OWF Matthew's World Championship & tonight I will introduce the Champion's Corner. Also known as C.C. which will be a column by your OWF Matthew's World Champion, ME! I will talk about all the horrible things in this federation, such as Mikey, Mars & Flash, also the prop managers. I will also talk about the good things in the federation, such as me, my OWF Matthew's World Championship, me & that's about it. So look for the debute column soon on the OWF's official website. Which happens to have a picture of me you can all stare & drule at.<P>[The camera view goes black.
