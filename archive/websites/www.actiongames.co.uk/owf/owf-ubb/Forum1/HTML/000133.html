</FONT><HR>(((clips from newshows)))<P>"About 2 weeks ago, Angel, a wrestler in the world famous OWF, died...or so we thought...as it seems Angel has returned to the ring..."<P>"Angel, the wrestler killed someone else in order to make it appear as if he was dead..."<P>"Not much is known about the current things and if anyone is missing..."<P>"No one has heard of Angel since he was seen on Tuesday at an OWF show..."<P>"Angel, the wrestler, seems to have gone mad..."<P>..."we don't know what the police will do about the situation..."<P>"Which can only leave us with one question...who was thrown off the rafters?"<P>"...but the thinge everyone is wondering... does this man have a soul?"<P>(((Angel, sitting in a couch, at his house...it is a nice house and he is sitting on a leather couch.  Angel has just finished flipping through the channels)))<P>Angel: Well it looks like I am one of the most popular men on TV.  That's good to know...but do I want it?   No.  Do I need it?  No.  But anyways, I don't beleive I have ever introduced anyone into my house, you know, the kind of conditions I live in.  Based upon my character in the OWF, you guys would think I am straight ghetto...Well guess what...I am my character.  Everything you have seen me go through is real, Mike loves it, he thinks I am working some Angle that will blow everyone away, and in a way I am, I am working the Angle of my life.  I have control of my destiny, my angle.<P>Now, as you can see, I live nicely, nice house, yeah, that is 24 carrot gold up there on the ceiling.  Yes those are 10th century sculptures.  Ha.  I thought I wanted all this when I first got into this, but I don't, I don't want it at all.  All of this that you see is show.  It is what he promised me.  He does no how to keep his word you know, l could trust him, I could trust him with everything, everything but my life, but as it happens that was the one thing I trusted him with.<P>I remember seeing a newsreporter...Angel has gone mad... That gets me.  You know, we all hold the right to go a little nuts now and then, you know, to keep us from killing ourselves of the pressure, but mad...no, I am not a madman Mrs.  I am just a regular guy with a bitch that won't let go of me.  You know those wounds I had right before I died, check them out, as you can see those are REAL scars.  (((Angel shows his gash wounds all over his body from "him")))<P>Well he is the madman.  He lost it, his grand vision of a euphoria, all gone, anything resembling utopia, gone.  I knew he had lost sight of what once made him great, and that is why  I needed to step up and finish what he was meant to.  So that is what makes me the leader of my desitiny, and in a way, all of yours.<P>Now I would like to say, everyone, you all can pretty much observe that I don't exactly...how do I say, "interact" with everyone here too great.   I'm kind of a loner.  And Night Crawler, this isn't out of character, you think you are a rebel huh...well if you only knew who that was who was thrown off the rafters, you just might have thinken twice about it.  Night Crawler, I have seen your tapes, good stuff, my stuff.   You filled the void of no me when you were gone, mysterious, but Night Crawler (read: begin Angel picking on his past) you aren't as bad as you think you are.  You do everything in your power to convince yourself that you are a rebel, it's laughable really.  When I did my little trick on everyone I knew there would be someone like you, someone who doens't know how to take his hurt, the pain, the inner torment going on inside of you.<P>And Bloodshed, in your words: "whadup bro"  Yeah, we didn't really have a chance to converse much on Tuesday, and beleive me, it was tough not to reveal to you that I would be returning, but as I see it, that was our first time in the ring together, as a team, and I think we did well.  You deserve more credit for who you are, you are you, I think one of the few people in this federation besides me who really does portry their character as their character.  Mike, forgive me for the ooc comment, but when you and I, bloodshed, talk outside wrestling (which doesn't happen much) you are yourself, and that's why you are the only one I feel that is worthy of getting my trust.<P>Being in this federation teaches me something about my self all the time, it teaches me that I can deal with my emotions, express them, and no one will do shit about it, because we all (should) be mature individuals.  But then if I can learn, someone who doesn't really talk to much, to say what is REALLY on my mind, then why can't everyone else?<P>I am not without faults.  As much as I have improved in the feild of expressing myself, I am not good with people, I guess that can go back to the fact that I was always the follower, the one who was given orders, I liked that, being a leader is tough, especially on your soul.  <P>You think this roleplay might be odd for me, based on the fact I am not really being mysterious, but he does exist, and you people will learn who he is, in time, but it isn't as easy to say, there needs to be a time, some where where I can reveal who his is, and at that time, he will be standing before you, the man who thinks he is the judge, will undergo judgement from everyone.<P>Well later I'll take you all around my house, but I'm out for now.<P>***ooc: everything above is a roleplay, I am not really Angel's personality in real life, there was not one bit of OOC in the previous roleplay, it was all Angel talking.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana">IP: 200.36.49.75</font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="90%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><P>All times are CT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000133&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000133&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
