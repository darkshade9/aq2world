</FONT><HR>(((News Reporters)))<P>News Reporter: Once again Angel has dissapeared.  He was last seen somewhere in Miami after is show at Tuesday Night Taser, no one knows where he is.<P>News Reporter: The story of Angel is shrouded in mystery, frankly, no one knows anything about this madman.<P>News Reporter: The man is always gone, he never checks in with anyone, could care less about his job, but still this superstar manages to stay that--a superstar.<P>News Reporter: ...after all this, how can the fans love him as they do?  Is it just plain old fashoined pity?<P>News Reporter:  The fans love him because he is real...<P>News Paper Headline: GONE AGAIN??? WHERE IS ANGEL?  <P>(((there is a dark figure, the dark figure puts on a flashlight revealing it is angel, apparently hiding somewhere in the dark)))<P>Angel: (looking around and whispering)  Ok, this has gone way to far!  I thought he was mad before...boy was I wrong, he has lost it, any bit of sanity he once had or at least I beleived he has is absolutely diminished, he isn't the same, he used to be the caring father figure we all need, I was deprived of that...but then, then HE came, he filled the void, got me where I thought I wanted, but I am not there anymore, I don't want to be here, but no time for this mindless talk, I need to address two things before he finds me.<P>First off, Bloodshed, you are the only one whom I will allow to find me, and he will allow to rescue me.  If the cops come, they will have to die.  If anyone comes, they will have to die, it is not my decision, it is his, and the only one he will let come is you, so please bloodshed, I am putting my life in your hands, if you don't come to rescue me, I am as good as dead, and I won't make it until  Saturday, which brings me to my next topic.<P>Night Crawler, you want me in the ring?   You'd better do 8 promos a day if you want to survive against me.  I'll fight you, he encourages that I fight, why else do you think he brought me to TNT for the match and made me get out without talking to anyone?  Night Crawler, I think you will be my first real opponent.  I was among this first 3 people to join this federation, and I have yet to have a really good singles match.  I think I have only fought one and had two tag matches, this emphasising the fact I am not in this to wrestle, I am here to find spiritual awakening, I am here to get through my life, and I am here to rid him of me.<P>But I can't talk much longer, he knows where I am, he always knows, he can always here me, he sees what I see, but I am getting too close, all I can say is my suffering at his attempt of spiritual awakening isn't over yet, look at these: (Angel has halo's deeply carved around his joints: shoulders, elbows, and knees) These are the wounds of a warrior, someone who fights but looses.  The real warrior doesn't  posses the gold, the real warrior fights and learns to accept the truth: he can never win.  I know this, and for this I fight day in and out and loose, because that is how it was intended, I take pain for every wrestler who believes they cannot feel pain, and beleives they never will, I am their savior, I am here for them.  And to who I through over the rafters it was- oh shit, I got to go now, he's coming, I can...feel...it.<P>(((The lights go off and the camera falls to the ground, you can hear fighting going on in the back, you can here screaming of pain, you here slashing, then the fighting stops.  All of a sudden it stops.  You here a figure fall to the ground, complete silence.  Then, in the distance you here something, it is very quiet)))<P>?????: What is that?  The dripping...of blood.  It needs to happen.  all of these news lines, these reporters, they try so hard to dig deep into the mind of him, but they never will because they can't.   They say Angel has gone mad, I am mad, so is Angel, we are equally mad.  I was not ready to let angel tell you who was dropped from the rafters, if you think it was me you need to be kidding, I am here, in the flesh.  You have never seen me so I must reveal something, Angel doesn't get slaughtered in the fights, he actually puts up a good fight, I have many wounds, but in the end, Angel is the apprentice, and I didn't want to teach him this way.  He thought he could just leave me whenever, that just won't--it can't happen, whether Angel wants to or not, he will learn under me, because that is HOW IT NEEDS TO BE.<P>(((Silence.  All that can be heard is the dripping of blood)))<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana">IP: 194.164.6.82</font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="90%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><P>All times are CT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000180&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000180&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
