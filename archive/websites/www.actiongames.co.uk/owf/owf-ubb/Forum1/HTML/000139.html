</FONT><HR>( Ground Zero. The name was not simply a title ... it was a prediction. From the start, tempers flared, to the very end ... where a family was destroyed. Crossbones and his brother Skull fought in the most extreme Inferno Match in the history of the OWF 2000, where only one man could walk away. Ladders and tables and chairs were used in one, singular attempt to stop the other from attaining victory. There could be only one winner.  And that man ... was Skull. The first man to ever defeat Crossbones was his own flesh and blood, who was also the man to take his OWF 2000 .Com  Championship away. But almost anyone you talk to will tell you, that if not for the shocking revelation of Crossbones' father, Stryfe, the match ending would have favored Crossbones. Now, only a week after the hellacious main event, the fans have packed into the local arena to bare witness to what follows. In a flash of fire, haunting music begins, as the new OWF 2000 .Com champion makes his first appearence with the belt. Skull. With him, the man who sealed the fate of World championship contender, Stryfe. The fans boos nearly rock the arena off of its very foundation, as the slowly lurch toward the ring. Skull slid in, as Stryfe climbed in through the ropes, a mic in his hand.)<BR> <BR> Stryfe: I present to you, your new OWF 2000 .COM  Champion, and my beloved son  ... Skull!!<BR> <BR> ( Stryfe cackled to himself, as he let the mic drop to his side. The fans booed at the presentation, bringing an even louder laugh from his lips. Skull remained emotionless, as the fans boos grew to a mind blowing roar. Suddenly, the boos stopped, disenegrating into a chant. The fans chanted only one word ... one name: Crossbones! Stryfe's laugh ceased, as he soaked in all the noise, a scowl covering his face.)<BR> <BR> Stryfe: If that is the man whom you are looking for, look elsewhere, because I promise you ... he will not show up here tonight! Half of that very man rests back in Milwalkee. I believe that his blood still cakes the floors of that arena. Crossbones ... son ... the match that was hyped up for months ... the match between yourself and your brother ... will indeed go down in history. It will not go down as your great victory. It will not go down as the day you freed your brother from my grasp. It will, instead, go down ... as your final match!<P>  ( All over the arena, fans continued their onslaught of boos, drink holders and the like flying to ringside. The name of Crossbones rang out from their lips, as Stryfe continued to smile. Finally, the smile faded away into a grim look of despair.)<P>  Stryfe: Now, since you have all decided to spoil my perfect mood by bringing up that miscrent, I guess it's time for daddy dearest to explain himself. Why did I do it? Why did I take one child with perfect potential, and let him rot in the juices of this world ... and then take my other son, the weaker ... the handicapped ... and turn him into my perfect engine of destruction? It's simple ... because the handicapped are much more easy to mold. I attempted to bestow my gift on the smarter ... more gifted Crossbones, but his willpower wouldn't soccumb completely, as did Skull's. So I go to my son ... quivering in the dark, scared of his own shadow ... and make him a mindless drone, always in my service!!!<BR> <BR>  ( The fans broke out into a frenzy, the despicable actions of a father, causing hatred to go forth in the form of shouts and screams. Then, Stryfe continued the verbal assault, now turning to the tormented soul of his son.)<BR> <BR>  Stryfe: But you almost failed me, didn't you? You almost let your brother defeat you last night, and walk away victorious. It took my intervention ... my help for you to walk away as champion ... and that ... is unacceptable!<BR> <BR> ( Suddenly, he lurched back, heaved forward, and launched a wad of spit into the face of his son. Skull remained emotionless, not even reaching up to wipe it off. Stryfe smiled, as he repeated the action, again spitting on the face of his son. But as he went to repeat the action, Skull's arm shot out, his palm wrapping around the neck of his father, as his other arm went up to wipe the spit from his cheek. The fans exploded in cheers, as he began to choke the life from his father, causing him to drop to his knees, his teeth gritted. Skull began to yells omething at his father, tightening the vice around his neck, before his face once again went blank. His hand released him, Stryfe dropping on all fours to the ring mat. Skull had once again fallen under the seemingly inescapable trance, as Stryfe pulled himself up, picking the mic up also.)<BR> <BR> Stryfe: Don't you ever ... EVER ... try anything like that again ... or I swear, you won't live to see another day, boy!I have told you time and again that you are a fool! You are a nothing! You have been a disgrace since the day you formed in your mother's womb ... you pitiful piece of garbage! I swear that if you ever try that again ... I wi ...<BR> <BR> ( Whatever he had wished to state would have to wait until another day. He was cut off in midsentance by an explosion of fire, that shot the fans into a frenzy. As this action occured, all the lights in the arena faded, as the music of Crossbones kicked in. The crowd went berzerk, trying to get a closer look at the entranceway, hopimg for a glimpse at the former champion. But, instead of Crossbones, two monks cloaked in black appeared, rolling out two caskets. On each casket, a name was written. One said Skull, the other Stryfe. As they wheeled to the ring, a spotlight from the roof shone down on them, as they pulled the caskets toward the ring. When they reached it, they split, one going right, the other left. When the monks stopped, they motioned toward the caskets, moving away from them a few inches. Both Stryfe and Skull began to move, each heading for the casket with their name spray painted on the side. At the same time, they swung them open, revealing what was inside ... revealing ... nothing!? The caskets were empty. When they turned to the monks for questioning, they unmasked themselves, revealing ... Valek and an unknown figure! Under one of the hoods, the man known as Valek stood, appearing for only the third time in his OWF 2000 career! The fans cheered, some of them mediocre, not knowning how to respond to the man. The unknown man had brown hair, brought back into a small ponytail in the back, tied by a rawhide string. Under his left eye, a scar tore down his cheek. Across both arms, were snakes ... tattoed in strange allignment, coming together on his bare back. His pants were black, as well as his boots, which shone in the arena light. But, nevertheless, the team unleashed arrays of punches and boots, stunning them. Then, they each disrobed, revealing chairs hidden under the cloaks. Steadying the chairs, they each swung, knocking Stryfe and Skull to the arena floor. Then, using all their strength, the hoisted them into the caskets, slamming the lids closed. Then, again to the shock of the crowd, they pulled a cache of nails from their pockets, a hammer from the other. As they began to nail them closed, Crossbones' music began again, as another monk headed toward the ring, another casket in his clutches. Rolling it out, the monk stopped at the landing of the ramp, turning the casket sideways. The monk left the arena, leaving the casket alone. Then, in a flash of light, a lightning bolt struck the casket, causing it to catch on fire. As it slowly caught ablaze, a video came on the Titan-Tron, a voice narating in the backround.)<BR> <BR> Voice: As the sands of the hour glass slip by and by, counting the time until you die. As the flames envelope your body ... the question remains. Can you pull yourself from the flames ... can you rise, like the Pheonix, from the ashes!<BR> <BR> ( When the voice concluded, the casket lid flew open, as a body sat up from the flames, his head turning to the ring. Stepping from the box, he came into the light, revealing ... Crossbones! His body was badly burned, the flames having scorched his back. But the falmes came together, in almost a design, as he came into the veiw of the crowd. Other than that, he remained as he always had ... dark and emotionless. Then, he raised his arms, causing thick smoke to pour into the arena, completly enveloping him. When it finally cleared, he was gone, as was the casket. The crowd stared in complete amazement, as Valek and the unknown man walked from the ring, the unknown man stopping at the top. Suddenly ... he spoke.)<P> Man: The time is coming. He has been struck down. He has been risen. Now ... there are only two prophecies left to fufill. The first ... they must come. The first ... we must come. Death ... Plague ... War ... Famine ... these are the ones that shall usher him in. These are the ones that shall bring him forth from the hades. These are the ones that shall bring the apocalypse to earth. We are the ones ... who shall end this. Death stands here ... know this. The web has been woven ... but it is merely that. You must look past what you think you know ... into what WE know!<P> ( As soon as he had spoken, the strange man turned, leaving the crowd to think on what he had just said. Though confusing, they held an inner meaning that struck terror to those who heard.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana">IP: 63.27.116.143</font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="90%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><P>All times are CT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000139&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000139&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
