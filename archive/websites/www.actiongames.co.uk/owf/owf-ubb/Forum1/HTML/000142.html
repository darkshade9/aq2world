</FONT><HR>[Two guys are seen sitting at a wooden table in a small room surrounded by wooden walls. The guy on the right, appears to be Shawn Matthews in baggy blue jeans & a faded yellow t-shirt. Across from him sits a man with a beer gut, dressed in relaxed fit blue jeans & a black t-shirt. They're both drinking beers & seem to be speaking. The camera zooms up to them, listening to there conversation.]<P>Shawn:Yeah, those were the good old days. We would drive around from town to town sleeping outside of resturaunts in our cars, that were surrounded by semi trucks. We had no worries, we just wrestled for $25 a night. If we didn't have enough money, we would work at a resturaunt for a few days & leave with no one ever seeing us again. Jason, those were the good old days.<P>[The other guy, now identified as Jason, laughs a bit.]<P>Jason:Yeah, but now you've made it to the big time. You're the World Champion. You get to fly first class & sleep in fancy hotels instead of a $5,000 car. You have the life now, back then life was hard.<P>Shawn:Yeah, but it was so much more fun. In the independent shows, we wrestled against wrestlers. No one faked there death or did any dumb shit like that.<P>Jason:I can't believe Angel would do something so dumb. That in my opinion is a disgrace to this sport. I would almost say it's mocking some of the legends who have died like that.<P>Shawn:I almost want to fight him, as low as he is on the rankings, just to teach that worthless, over appreciated wrestler a lesson.<P>Jason:So what are you going to do about some of the wreslters that don't give up or realise that they suck. Such as Jack Flagg & Haze.<P>[Shawn laughs for a few seconds. Then he takes a drink of the can of Coors Light. He sets the beer down & begins to speak again.]<P>Shawn:Jack Flagg, that guy is a joke. He has interfered in almost everyone of my matches & every time he screws up & causes me to defeat my opponent much easier. I wouldn't be suprised to see him try & fail again Saturday. <P>Jason:True, Jack Flagg isn't the most dependable guy to help you win a match, but what about Haze. He lost to you & now he wants revenge.<P>Shawn:Haze sucks. He sucked at Back In Business & he still sucks. Haze, thinks I wouldn't have won that title without Jack Flagg screwing up again. Well then he obviously is that damn dumb, because there is no way I could have lost that match. I kicked his ass the whole match. He never really did have a chance. The belt is on the waist of the better man & if he thinks he's gonna stop me from being the best OWF World champion, well then he can think again. <P>Jason:Have you ever thought about being a politician?<P>Shawn:SHUT UP!<P>Jason:Sorry, but it was funny.<P>Shawn:Yeah, sure it was & you can drink more then 1/2 a can of beer.<P>[Jason grabs a cold beer out of a cooler beside there feet. He pops it open & chugs it down. He tosses the camera aside & goes back to enjoying his cold beer he was slowly drinking.]<P>Shawn:Is that suppose to impress me.<P>Jason:Nope, it's just proof. Anyways back to your career that you love so much, you have a match this Saturday. Shouldn't you be training?<P>[Shawn laughs for a while.]<P>Shawn:I am fighting Anarchy in a non-title match. This guy dosn't even deserve to shine my boots, let alone wrestle with me. Then again, now that I think of it, no one really has proven there self World Title contender material.<P>Jason:Hey, I know he is full of more shit then Al Gore or the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but you gotta remember he is over 7' tall. <P>Shawn:Yeah, so what. Is that suppose to impress me. Seeing him bump his head into everything he walks under dosn't impress me. His uncoordinated, skinny ass is one of the last things I have to worry about. He acts like he is some great talented wrestler who can do it all. He makes a big deal over how he was the Vice President. He says he's twisted & is a great technical wrestler. <P>[Jason breaks out laughing. He starts talking, yet he is still laughing.]<P>Jason:That tall freak, is a technical wrestler. He didn't say that, did he? He dosn't even know the difference between a hammer lock & a wrist lock. A 7 foot technical wrestler. That will be the day. I suppose he can do 360 moonsaults too. A technical wrestler who is a fake gang banger & tall side show freak. What a laugh.<P>Shawn:Yeah, this tall shit, dosn't realise that if he wants to go technical with a wrestler who's style is technical, then he is going to loose. If he get's technical with me, he will loose his height advantage. Now you freak of nature, you big pimp. You think I had it easy, well guess again. If I wanted to, I could have had a great & easy life, but I chose not to. I didn't like it. So now come Saturday, you'll realise that not only are you the dumbest wrestler in this federation, but your also the newest wrestler to have fallen to my unbelieveable, undefeated record. Saturday you will find out why I am the World Champion.<P>[Shawn & Jason laugh as the camera zooms out & cuts away.]<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana">IP: 205.198.1.129</font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="90%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><P>All times are CT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000142&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000142&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
