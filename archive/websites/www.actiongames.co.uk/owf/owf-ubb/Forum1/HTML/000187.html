</FONT><HR>(((Saynt is seen sitting in a leather chair reading a newspaper)))<P>Saynt: (looks up)  Ahh, I didn't even see you there, let me show you around my humble house where I hang my hat...or not.  Listen, I asked you guys here so I could tell someone something and that is what I am going to do...someone who needs to know this, and you, Marasmus, are that man.  <P>It seems kind of odd how you are the one everyone wants to pick on as soon as they get here, into this amazing federation the OWF 2000...this newspaper is an old issue, one of many in my collection beleive it or not.  This particular one is about Bloodshed, who does have a major part in my and your history.   The day bloodshed got here he decided to pick on you...and it seems like it was just a random thing, you know, "I want you in a hardcore match" but oh no, it started out with him wanting to get in bed with your chic, but it is SO much more than that, I know he knows, and I could care less, what I am saying is that he knows the truth and so do I.  <P>Trust me, Bloodshed hates me.  End of Story.  Then there are some other guys who wanted to get in fights with you, but get this...Mike wouldn't allow it!  I found this on scoopswrestling.com, you know that site where fans can see stuff that they don't get to on TV, it's a place for the hardcore fans, and a place where we as wrestlers should be checking to make sure we even know the truth, because you never know what kind of dirty secrets Mike has behind him.<P>But really Marasmus, Bloodshed hates me, and to my grave you will hate me.  You are the kind of guy that makes me sick, the one who doesn't think he has everything but when compared to someone like me you have it all.  Marasmus, any bit of complaining you will ever do will make me hate you more and more.  Anything you want--no request will make me hate you more and more, you, Marasmus are the personification of all that I hate.  You are what I should have been.  You have what should be mine, and because of that I will haunt you day in and day out until I receive that which is rightfully mine.<P>Why did I turn on you at TNT everyone is asking?  We had the opportunity to really make it in this fed as a tag team, but I didn't come to this federation for some brotherly love, I came for you, for revenge.  Marasmus, had you not been born, had I wedged myself through mother's womb sooner than you, I would be where you are now, everything you would have would have been mine.  Mom didn't care, I was the "second" she wanted one, and of course she is going to go for the one who was doing better...did I have a choice that you took more food from me in the womb and I came out smaller?  Mom didn't like me as much as you, why?  Because you got lucky.  You were the first one out.  You always seemed to get more food, it is because of luck and luck only you are better, but the thing that I will never forget is that it looked like Mom favored you before either of us was born!  It just isn't fair.  If I was born first everything you know would not be and everything you have would be mine, even you, Lizzy.<P>Do you see these muscles?  You were born stronger than me, for that I had to work for these, these are mine and mine alone, I worked and this is what payed off.  You, Marasmus got lucky, you got the good side of the gene pool.  It isn't fair.  You got lucky and that is the only reason you are where you are today.<P>Now do I sound like a whiner?  Maybe.  I don't care what anyone thinks of me, even you Marasmus, I just could care less.  But when it is all said and done and the day is over, I, not you, will end up with the better half, the half I deserved, the life I deserved, and that you robbed from me at such a young age.<P>Now get the hell out of my house...I got to do some reading.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana">IP: 194.164.6.82</font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="90%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><P>All times are CT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana"><A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000187&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/cgi-bin/owf/owfubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000187&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
