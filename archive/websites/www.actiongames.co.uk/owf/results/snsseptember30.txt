!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tonight, on Surge:
------------------
What many consider a New OWF is completely operational
again.  The wrestlers have been given a boost when it 
comes to almost every aspect of the sport and the fans 
couldn't be any excited.  Tonight, with 4 matches, on 
Saturday Night Surge, we have: 
--------------------------------------------------------
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


****************************************
(((The crowd, as usual, sold out, anxiously awaiting the show that is about
to happen, 4 of what will be crucial matches that lead up to the first ever
OWF Pay Per View, Back in Business.  When WrestleMania 1999 happened, there
were a few cable companies that couldn't handle the demand, Mike has 
personally made sure that every city has no trouble viewing the first ever
Pay Per View.  Finally the lights go out and Mike makes his way to the ring.

Mike: Well I would like to welcome you all.  You are all a very, very 
special audience...do you want to know why that is?  Because this is the
last SNS.

(((the crowd is shocked)))

Mike:...the last SNS before the most amazing spectacle that wrestling has
ever seen.  You guys have almost made it, the OWF has lasted about a month
and a half and no slowing down.  On Tuesday I will reveal to you something
that ewrestling has seen only once, something that will put a huge spin on
things, it will be a bonus for the fans and wrestlers, it can only affect 
the wrestlers if they let him, they can choose to let it matter or choose
to not let it matter, but either way, it will be quite something new.

Also, a week ago tonight, Crossbones hurt Mark Blaze seriously, and as the
result he has not been able talk all week, well tonight, hesitantly, Mark
Blaze has allowed for several of our camera men to come in and ask him a few
questions.  If you know Blaze you know that this is something big...so we'll
see what he has to say.  Well that's all for tonight, you didn't come here
to see me, you came to see some fights...and I think I have some for you...

(((Mike leaves the ring.)))

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 1: Genocide Vr. Shane Bishop
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barry: Well that was Mike folks...not the most...average prez...I don't 
think anyone knows how much that guy does...he runs this on his own...he 
gets wrestlers, keeps the facilities up, and gets these events all 
straightened out.  What Johnny, you gonna call me gay or something?

Johnny: Actually Barry, at the Pay Per View you and me have a serious match,
and when I used to be a wrestler, I respected my opponent, and now that you
are my opponent, I must respect you, so lets do some commentating, maybe a 
little color commentating...is that ok with you?

Barry: Uh...yeah, ok.   Hey, so this match is with Genocide and Shane
Bishop...the history behind this is a week or so ago Genocide had a chance
to earn he Tag Team Championship with Marasmus, but Shane screwed them over
more than once, although it wasn't Genocide that Bishop was after.

Johnny: Yeah, so lets get to the match!  Here comes Genocide now.

(((Genocide's music hits and he walks to the ring, nothing special, then 
Bishop's music hits and he goes to the ring normal too.  Mike doesn't really
push entrances too much...)))

Genocide stares at Bishop for a second then they charge each other, Genocide
blocks Bishop's first punch and then goes for a leg sweep.  Bishop jumps
over Genocide's leg and goes straight into a kick.  Genocide wobbles a bit
but Bishop takes advantage of that and throws him into the rope.  When
Genocide comes back around Bishop backs up a few steps then dives into him
hard with a flying Clothesline.  Genocide hits the ground, Bishop looks 
around for cheers, but the crowd boos.  Bishop walks around the ring, 
yelling for cheers, but when he turns around Genocide is gone.  Bishop 
looks around the ring, Genocide isn't there.  Bishop jumps outside the ring
then two hands come out from under the ring and hold Bishop's feet.  Bishop
starts stomping around.

Johnny: I wonder who that is...

Then from the other side of the ring Genocide gets out and runs to the top 
rope, Bishop totally unaware of what is going on.

Barry: What?  Genocide doesn't have any allies yet!  Who is that?

Bishop is still trying to get the hands loose and then sees Genocide above
him, right when Genocide jumps.   Bishop gives a shocked look, checks the
hand on his feet, and looks back up to be greeted with Genocide's forearm.
Bishop is down.

Johnny: Who is that?  

The person under the ring runs out and runs away, he is wearing a mask and
a loose treanch coat so no one can see his build.  Genocide gets up just a 
bit faster than Bishop...the ref starts the count- 1....2.....3......4
and Bishop punches Genocide and runs into the ring....6.....7....8....
and Genocide gets back in the ring, the count stops.  As Genocide enters 
Bishop lands a ddt hard on the mat.  Genocide gets back up.  Bishop goes for
another DDT but Genocide turns it into a awesome, harder, rock bottom move.

Barry: Great, great, reversal.

Genocide goes to the top rope and dives his elbow into the thigh of Bishop.
Bishop shows pain, Genocide gets up and stomps the leg a few times. 
Genocide goes for the pin: 1.....2.........3 and Genocide wins his revenge.

Barry: Nice...
And the Winner is:  Genocide

Match 2: Lightning Vr. Kirk Storm: for #1 contender of .ORG belt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny: During the commercial, you saw it, you know what it was, I don't 
need to remind you, the two wrestlers, Kirk Storm and Lightning made their
way to the ring.  This is a hardcore match for #1 contendership of the .ORG
title.

Barry: Johnny, they are almost on the verge of Jobbers, no one has heard 
from them in a long time.

Johnny: Yeah, I don't like t use the word Jobber though, because just the 
fact that they are wrestlers deserves credit, but if they ever want to get
some where, they shouldn't disappear like this.

Barry: Well here we go.

The bell rings and both wrestlers run to opposite sides of the ring, they
each grab a chair and charge each other, it is only a matter of timing to
see who hits the other person first, and the other one will have quite a 
bump to bring home for the family. Lightning swings the chair above his head
and Kirk Storm hits his chair into Lightning's, then jabs Lightning in the
stomach with it.  Lightning keels over to the ground.  Kirk Storm sets the
chair down on the back of Lightning, then does a flip onto the chair, it 
hurts Lightning but also Kirk Storm shows signs of pain.

Johnny: Some of these guys can just be stupid, he can get force if he wants
by kicking it with his foot, but instead he hurts himself to do a show offy
move.

Barry: I agree.

Kirk Storm gets up, lightning rolls under the ring and comes out with a 
baseball bat--you never know what kinds of stuff they'll have under that 
ring...Well anyways, Lightning swings it into the ankle of Kirk Storm and
Kirk Storm falls to the ground.  Lightning takes the bat and hits Kirk 
Storm in the back, he tries again, but Storm rolls out of the way, he 
grabs lightning's old chair and gets up fast and hits lightning over the 
head with it.  He sets up the chair over lightning.  He goes up to the 
top rope and jumps down right onto the chair, the chair collapses and 
Lightning spits out blood immediately.  

Johnny: That was much, much smarter.

Storm throws the chair out of the way and grabs the bat.  He hits Lighting
in the stomach with it and then hits him in the side.  Lightning is spitting
blood and is at risk at drowning over his own blood.  The ref urges Storm
to end the match all ready, for the sake of Lightning's life.  Storm 
complys and goes for the pin: 1..........2........3 and Kirk Storm is the 
#1 contender of the .ORG belt.
And the Winner is: Kirk Storm

Interview with Mark Blaze in the Hospital
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(((The camera man and a rookie OWF reporter walk into the hospital room of
Mark Blaze.  Blaze looks bad, but like he is definately recovering.)))

Reporter: Mr. Blaze, thank you for you time.

Blaze: (no response)

Reporter: Well anyways, what is your position on Crossbones now?

Blaze: (rolls his eyes and has no response)

Reporter: How do you think you can make an impact on th OWF?

Blaze: (no response)

Reporter: uhhh(Getting nervous)  What do you want your next event to be?

Blaze: (looks at the reporter, gives no response)

The reporter is sweating and looks to the camera and looks for help, he 
gets none, the camera man tells the reporter to not look at the camera man
for help.

Reporter: Well Mark Blaze is in serious physical and mental pain right now
(Blaze giggles) and cannot talk with us unfortunately.  Thank you for your
time Mr. Blaze and I hope you recover soon.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 3: Marasmus Vr. Mustafa Vr. Arch Angel
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(((the lights go out and then an eerie red light fills the ring and 
enterance way. the music plays and red mist fills up by the curtains leading 
from the backstage to the arena. a womanly figure step throught the mist and 
stops. when she stops, MaRaSmUs comes out in perfect tune with the music. 
they make their way to the ring, and MaRaSmUs goes between the ropes as lizzy 
uses the steps. MaRaSmUs then lifts the bottom rope for lizzy and she bends 
all the way over and under, much to the delight of the male audience.)))

Johnny: Not bad, not bad at all

(((As the intro of "What If" is played Arch Angel can be seen coming out of 
the back to look at the crowd. All of a sudden flashes of light are seen all 
around. Fireworks are seen from every direction. As they begin to end Arch 
steps out of the back and begins his way to the ring.)))

(((Sad but True" by Metallica starts to play, and the lights dim to a flicker. 
Then Pyros start exploding, and Mustafa comes out from behind the curtains. 
Mustafa stands at the top of the entrence, and a mixed crowd response of cheer's, 
and boo's. Mustaf then makes his way to the ring, and slides under the ropes. 
Mustafa then climbs a ring post, and does a Hitler salute.)))

The three wrestlers circle each other.  In this match all three are in the ring
at the same time and the first pin wins the belt, which puts the beltholder, 
Marasmus, at a huge disadvantage. Marasmus jumps at Mustafa.  Mustafa dodges,
turns around and goes for Marasmus.  Arch Angel grabs Mustafa by the back
and throws him out of the way and goes for a reverse suplex.  Arch Angel gets
up and Mustafa throws him out of the way and stomps on Marasmus.  Arch Angel
gets up and grabs Mustafa.  They lock up.  Arch Angel does a DDT on Mustafa.

Barry: Good stuff...

Mustafa gets up and exchanges punches with Arch Angel.  Meanwhile Lizzy is 
yelling for Marasmus to get up.  Marasmus gets up and has a little bit to rest.
Marasmus runs over to Mustafa and Arch Angels side of the ring and goes to 
the top rope.  He does a flip and clotheslines both wrestlers in mid air. 
Mustafa and Angel fall to the ring.  The ref goes to investigate Mustafa, who
looks like he got is worst.

Johnny: Uh oh...what is Lizzy doing?

Lizzy goes and grabs Marasmus' .NET belt and throws it in the ring to Marasmus,
while the ref is not watching.  Marasmus catches the belt and hits Arch Angel
in the head with it.  The ref didn't see it, Marasmus blows a kiss to Lizzy and
throws the belt back.  Lizzy grabs it and goes to put it where she got it from.
Mustafa gets up.  He sees that Arch Angel is out cold and dives for the pin:
1........2.......and Marasmus pulls Mustafa off Arch Angel.

Barry: I feel bad for Arch Angel, he just lays there while two other wrestlers
compete for him.

Marasmus goes for the pin, but Mustafa pulls him off.  Marasmus looks in his
eyes, flicks him off, kicks him in the stomach and lifts up Mustafa.  He lifts
Mustafa up on his shoulders and does a TKO type move into a Stunner(the Marasmic)
.  Marasmus goes for the pin on Mustafa, but Arch Angel got up and pulls Marasmus 
off Mustafa.  Marasmus does the Marasmic to Arch Angel, who is bleeding from the
forehead.  Marasmus puts them on top of each other and goes to the top rope.
He does a backflip and lands back first on both wrestlers.  Arch Angel, who looks
the worst, is put aside and Marasmus goes for the pin on Mustafa: 1.........2....
.........3  And Marasmus retains his .NET championship. 

Johnny: That was nice to Arch Angel and all, but really, really risky.  Oh well
He gets to keep his belt and that is all that matters.

And the Winner is:  Marasmus, The reigning .NET champion

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 4:  Bloodshed Vr. Shawn Matthews--
          For a shot at the WorldWW title at the PPV.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(((Smoke all over, jail bars open up and Bloodshed walks through he walks up to 
the stage, flicking off the booing crowd and spits in the middle of the ring 
then points upward for like 2 seconds.)))

Johnny: I don't exactly...understand this guy...

(((The arena goes black. Then on the screen above the entrance the word WARNING 
flashes in red. Firworks shoot straight up on each side of the entrance & Danger 
Zone starts to play. As the lights come on Shawn is standing looking straight at 
the entrance. He walks down the to the ring looking around the arena. He slides 
underneath the ropes & spreads his arms wide open & turns 360 degrees around 
looking at the whole entire arena.)))

Barry: Flashy...flashy...

Johnny: Ok, for those who don't know, this is a big match, we mean big here.
A while ago Angel (not Arch Angel, just plain Angel) Kidnapped Mike's sister
and demanded he be given a world title shot at the PPV.  Well Mike agreed and
got his sister back, but the Match was originally scheduled to be Angel Vr.
Valek, well Valek had to leave, so the match was left open ended.  Purple Haze
wants a shot at it, and so do Bloodshed and Shawn Matthews, and this match is  
to decide at least if Bloodshed or Matthews will take that position.

Barry: Yeah, so here we go.

Bloodshed goes right at Matthews with a hard spear.  Matthews gets up and Bloodshed
does a body slam on him.  Bloodshed jumps on Matthews over and over again, on about
the 4th jump Matthews grabs Bloodshed's ankle and twists it, Bloodshed looses 
balance and falls to the ground, grabbing his ankle.  Matthews puts Bloodshed in
a leglock while Bloodshed shows pain...but then he smiles, and with all his energy,
dives to the ropes, about a foot and a half from his arm.  He grabs the rope and
Matthews has to let go.

Johnny: Whoa, if Matthews didn't grab that ankle Bloodshed could have beat on him all
night.

Barry: Yeah, and if Bloodshed didn't get that rope Matthews could have held on to 
that leg forever.

Bloodshed gets up and is limping.  With his good leg he dives with all his power and
kicks Matthews in the face, Matthews falls to the ground while Bloodshed lands hard
on the ground, right on his shoulder.  Bloodshed gets up and walks over to Matthews.
Matthews, still on the ground.  Matthews uses his legs to grab Bloodshed's bad ankle
and pulls him to the ground.  Bloodshed looks like he is in Pain.  Matthews lifts him
up by the head and kicks Bloodshed in the gut. He then lifts him up for a standing 
suplex & drills his head into the mat. He then quickly hooks a leg & pins him. A.K.A. 
a Brain buster.

Johnny: That was Lights out...always a good move to see.

Bloodshed is almost out cold, Matthews goes for the pin, then Jack Flagg runs out, 
while the ref is inspecting Bloodshed.  Jack Flagg grabs Matthews from behind, 
and does the Hell Fire Driver on Matthews, then runs away fast.  The ref looks 
behind him and Bloodshed gets up and goes for the pin.  1........2..........3...
and Bloodshed is the #1 contender along with Angel for the WorldWW title.

Then Mike walks to the ring.

Mike: No no no no no!  Lets see about 2 minutes ago in the replays. (the camera
shows Jack Flagg runs out, when Matthews should have had the pin)  As you can 
see Bloodshed is out cold, if Flagg didn't come out Matthews would have one, s
that's why I award the match, and #1 contendership of the WorldWW title to
Shawn Matthews. 

And the Winner is: 
*******************************************************
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(((The camera shifts to the hospital, where the camera is shaking as if the
cameraman is running fast.  The cameraman opens the door of Mark Blazes room
to see nothing but smoke and fire, you can't see anything in there, the camera 
man backs up from the room.)))

Cameraman:  Did crossbones do this again?
