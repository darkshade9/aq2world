!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tonight, on Taser:
------------------
Shane Bishop will announce his requested match, no one has any idea of what
kind of match it will be and more importantly, who it will be against,
Although there is speculation it will be against Angel because he has
no match tonight.  
Then there is Marasmus and Genocide Vr. Ultimatum,  then Kirk Storm Vr. 
Crossbones Vr. Mark Blaze in a 3 way tag, where they can tag each other.  Of
course there will also be the Bloodshed Vr. Lightning match for the #1 
contender spt of the .ORG title, and finally, the main event, Terror Crew 
Vr. Purple Haze and Dallas Star, but not a regular match, for the #1 
contender position of Tag Team champions.
--------------------------------------------------------
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



****************************************
(((The crowd has been waiting for an hour now, there were people that have 
been outside for days hoping for a small chance that there will be a cheap 
scalper or any way of them getting into the arena.  The lucky crowd that
is inside is waiting, getting hyped up over the show that is about to
happen.  Finally the lights go out.   Who's it gonna be, who's it gonna 
be! Shane Bishop's music comes on and the crowd goes nuts.

Bishop: Haha, you guys all thought I left, well I didn't I am right here 
in front of you with a small...ok big announcment to make.  As you all 
know, a week ago today Mike approached me backstage and said I can have
a singles match againt anyone I want.  Well as you also know I have 
waited until tonight to announce exactly who that will be.  (Crowd is
cheering in anxioty about who it will be.) And the announcment is I will
not pick anyone to fight tonight.

(crowd is puzzled)

Bishop: instead I will be guest refereeing the Marasmus and Genocide Vr.
Ultimatum tag match.  (Crowd cheers crazily)  That's right, and I will
be as fair as possible.  Plus, the Tag Team belts are on the line!  Remember
though, I am not great friends with Ultimatum, but you guys know who I like
and who I don't, but you'll just have to wait till the match to see what I
do!  That's pretty much all I gotta say for now, I'm out.

(Fireworks go off and TNT begins.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 1: Bloodshed Vr. Lightning for #1 contender of .ORG title
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny-no-good: Well here we go.

Barry Barlett: Why didn't you read your cue card?

Johnny: Because it told me to say "here comes another great no-good night
for the OWF!"  How gay is that.

Barry: So, I always read my cue cards

Johnny: Yeah, I know, but you are forgetting, that's because you are gay.

(((The lights go out, everything turns to a red haze, Red lights start
flashing all over the place, Bloodshed's music comes on and he walks to the
ring.)))

Barry: Bloodshed used to be considered a rookie, but if you think about it,
now he is sort of sinking into the fed.

Johnny: Too easy, too easy.

(((Bloodshed waits in the middle of the ring, his veins starting to pop out
of his skin.  Then lightning strikes all 4 turnbuckles, most wrestlers, most
people for that matter would have at least flinched, but Bloodshed acted 
like he didn't even know it happened.  Spotlights fly around the audience
and Lightning walks to the ring.  As Lightning walks to the ring the 
announcers talk)))

Barry: Let me explain this match to you guys.

Johnny: Howabout we say damn that and I do it better.  Well listen, the 
match is for number one contender for the .ORG title, aka the winner gets 
to face Valek next, aside from the Angel-Valek match at the PPV, but that do
esn't count because it has been booked for a while.  This is a hardcore 
matchup, aka the ref is an ass and can't do shit.

Barry: God Johnny, this is live TV I don't think that was in the cue card.

Johnny: You know what...you know what...guess what...I don't fuckin care...
besides, the editing people are quick on their feet...er fingers...whatever.

Barry: Yeah, whatever, well I think the match is starting.  

Johnny: What the hell!

((( Someone throws a wooden plank to the ring. )))

Johnny: haha, that's a way to start it.

Lightning grabs the wooden plank and hits Bloodshed in the knee with it. He
then tries to do it again, but Bloodshed rolls out of the way, obviously in
a pain.  Bloodshed rolls right over a metal pole, this is a hardcore match, 
those things are there.  He takes the poll and hits Lightning in his knee.

Johnny: Hey, hey  Barry, read your cue.

Barry: Boy there, Bloodshed sure gave Lightning a bit of his own medicine.

Johnny: hahaha, who writes this shit?

Barry: hahaha, I have no clue.

Johnny: haha, yeah, hahaha, yeah...gay.

Barry: Listen Johnny, that was uncalled for. You had no reason, you say 
things just to try to insult me and get a laugh out of the home viewers.

Johnny: Dude, you said home viewers, you're so gay man.

Barry: (slams his hands down) I have had enough!

Johnny: What are you going to do about it...god calm down, you are messed up

Barry: No, you are messed up!

Johnny: ooooo, good comeback.

Barry: I'm leaving tonight, I don't care what the damn CEO's think.

Johnny: O, you are bad now!

Barry: Howabout this, you and me, Hell in a Cell, at the PPV, settle this 
like men.

Johnny: oh god, I would kill you, I don't think I will man, you will be 
destroyed.

Barry: I don't care, are you up to it?

Johnny: Whatever you want man...(barry walks out)  Well it's just me for
the rest of the night now...this is gonna suck, who will I rank on???

Meanwhile, Lightning and Bloodshed had lost their weapons and were 
exchanging minor moves.  Finally Bloodshed gains a bit of momentum and 
pushes Lightning out of the ring.  Bloodshed jumps out and looks for a 
weapon under the ring, which there always is.  Bloodshed grabs a pan and
"thumps Lightning in the back" (inside joke...heheheh Alec)  Then Bloodshed
hits lightning in the forehead with it.  

Johnny: right about now I would be making fun of Barry's cue...

Bloodshed looks under the ring again, and pulls out a table, and sets it up.
He then takes Lightning back into the ring and brings him to the top rope.
Bloodshed prepares for a suplex all the way down onto the table, very, very
dangerous.  Then Lightning gets stronger again and pushes, Bloodshed down
to the table, and then very very shortly after Lightning falls, not jumps, 
on Bloodshed.

Johnny: That was pretty sloppy, no wrestling there, but it did it's job...I 
never thought I would say it, but honestly, I do miss Barry...it's just so
easy to make fun of him...

They lay there and the ref starts the KO count. 1....2....3....4...5....6
finally, at the same time, Lightning and Bloodshed pop up, not get up slowly
but pop up in the air.  Bloodshed has tons of new energy and rips a leg of
the table off and starts mercessly bashing Lightning with it, both men are
bleading.

Johnny: Oh my god, look at what Barry would have said "I'll bet they have
alot of splinters now!" good god, this is sick.

Finally Lightning passes out from blood loss and Bloodshed passes out of
fatigue, right on Lightning, both men are uncounsious, the ref does the
count- 1......2.................3

And the Winner is:  Bloodshed 
********************************************************

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 2: Marasmus and Genocide Vr. Ultimatum (Neo and Darklander)
	 with the special guest referee: Shane Bishop! 
	 FOR THE TAG CHAMPIONSHIP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny: That match was really good I think, but if Barry were here, 
I would have to tell him how stupid he is.  Anyways, you have heard about
this match from Shane Bishop earlier, he is reffing it, and this is a big
deal because there is a highly coveted title on the line, I can think of
about 12 people who really want this title...god this isn't the same 
without Barry...Well anyway, here comes Ultimatum.

(((Ultimatum's music comes on.  Green code shines on all of the audience.
Neo and Darklander walk out.  They pause for several seconds, look at the
view of the audience green code.  Neo smiles.  Darklander leads to the ring.
They get there, Neo is happy, looking around, Darklander tells Neo to calm
down and then Neo gets his "Darklander" Face on and awaits his opponents.)))

Johnny: Well here we go, one man who had never fought in this fed, and 
Marasmus,  I wonder how this is going to go, they didn't have barely any
prepping time...

(((A rough remix of Marasmus and Genocide's music comes on and they walk to
the ring, no big entrance, no time to figure out what they plan on doing, 
so none the less time to make a respectable entrance.)))

Johnny: Marasmus is the one who can be sort of angry at this match, he is
trusting someone else to help him hold onto his gold...hey marasmus!
Sucks to be you! (Marasmus doesn't hear...Lizzy makes her way to the ring)
That's what I'm talkin about!  

Neo and Genocide start in the ring and Marasmus and Darklander make their 
ways to opposite corners of the ring.  Neo starts out with a Spear, it 
knocks the wind of of Genocide for a few milliseconds, but doesn't really
hurt him.  Genocide hits Neo on the back a few times to get Neo loose.  
Genocide knees Neo in the face and Neo drops to the ground.  Darklander 
chants to Neo to get up, Neo doesn't get up.  Genocide does a few elbow
drops and Darklander runs to the ring and starts punching Genocide.  Shane
Bishop sees it and pushes Darklander back to his corner, they argue, Marasmus
runs in and starts kicking Neo, still on the ground.

Johnny: oh someone fire these people! "What goes around comes around" Mike,
man, where did you get these guys!  5th grade! 

Marasmus runs back to his corner and Shane never saw it, although he is
suspicious that both wrestlers are on the ground...Neo and Genocide try to
get to their partners, Genocide gets there first.  Marasmus runs in and 
picks up Neo and does a powerbomb.  Marasmus goes for the pin- no count from 
Shone.  and Neo jumps out, tags Darklander and Darklander runs in.  Darklander
starts punching Marasmus, Bishop then runs over and assists Darklander.  
Marasmus falls to the mat.  Darklander runs to the top rope, Shane holds Marasmus
on the ground.  Darklander jumps doing a flying leg drop.  He lands it, but not 
smoothly, it looks like he landed on his butt bone (Ed. Note-Is there such a 
thing...)

Johnny: Ouch...god come back Barry!!!  I have been using the word God too 
much!!! I need something else to say!!!  Shane...he's such a sly guy...
I swear, these cue cards are going to make me kill myself.

Marasmus and Darklander are laying in the middle of the ring.  Darklander
gets up, and sort of does a "falling" elbow onto Marasmus, he goes for the
pin- (fast count) 1..2..Marasmus Barely jumps out.  Shane Bishop rolls his 
eyes, he looks kind of agitated.  Darklander looks to Neo, but
Neo is still out of it.  Darklander then gets up and does a flip onto
Marasmus' chest.  Bishop claps. Darklander then jabs his elbow into Marasmus' 
chest, Marasmus can't breath....he looks to the ref for help...Shane just 
laughs and does nothing about the onslaught occuring.Darklander gets up and 
stomps Marasmus hard on the chest, Shane joins in.  Marasmus starts coughing 
trickles of blood.

Johnny: Whoa, this is real blood folks, I mean, true blood, not scrapes
that cause lots of blood, but a real injury, but that's how it is in this
game...

Darklander jumps on Marasmus and goes for the pin immidiately- 1..2..3--
And there are two new OWF Tag Team Champions!  With a bit of help from
Shane Bishop...

And the Winner is: Ultimatum--The new Tag Champions!
********************************************************

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 3: Kirk Storm Vr. Crossbones Vr. Mark Blaze for the .COM title
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny: well that last match was decent, but would have been way better if 
I had Barry here to yell at.  Well any ways, this next match is a .COM 
championship match between Crossbones, the defending champ, Kirk Storm, and 
Mark Blaze.  It's a three way tag match which means there are only 2 guys 
fighting at a time and anyone can tag the person out.  It's a weird match, 
but odds are that it'll be good.

(((The lights go out.  Crossbones' music comes on.  All spotlights fly around 
the arena and settle on Crossbones.  They follow Crossbones to the ring.  Get 
gets to the ring, rolls his pupils to the back of his eyes and concentrates 
hard on the upcoming fight)))

Johnny: He's a … special … boy… We need to go to commercial, I won't tell you 
who are sponsors are because 1.  I don't care and 2. You'll see in about 30 
seconds.

Johnny:  During the commercial Kirk Storm came to the ring. We are just 
waiting for a newcomer, former IWF world Champion, Mark Blaze.

(((The lights go out and Mark Blaze's Music comes on, he runs to the ring, 
he is a newcomer and is ready to take full advantage of this title shot 
opportunity.  He runs to the ring, shoves Kirk Storm out of the way and goes 
straight at Crossbones with a flying clothesline.)))

Kirk Storm looks angry that he doesn't get to start the match out, he is the 
one who challenged Crossbones first anyway.  Crossbones shakes a bit and gets 
up.  He runs at Mark Blaze and starts punching him a bit.  Kirk Storm is 
screaming to get called in.  Crossbones does a few left hand punches and then 
a leg sweep.  He grabs Mark Blaze's chin, spins him around on the ground with 
it, and turns it into a "Steiner Recliner" type of move.  Mark Blaze looks 
shocked, and in Pain.

Johnny: Mark Blaze is probably surprised that Crossbones could do that, I 
had a chance to talk with this guy earlier, and he told me how he has been 
studying Crossbones tapes.  Crossbones isn't a submission wrestler to say 
the least.   God I am becoming lame without Barry.  I even use God too much! 
God Dammit! God I did it again!  No!  Whyyyyyyyy!!!

Mark Blaze uses his foot and kicks Crossbones in the face, thus making 
Crossbones let go.  Mark Blaze gets up and does a roundhouse kick to the 
right cheek of Crossbones, another thing not expected in this type of match.  
Kirk Storm is still screaming to get in.  Crossbones gets a small cut on the 
side of his mouth and gives a grin, nods to Mark Blaze and continues with the 
fight.  Just as Mark Blaze charges Crossbones, Crossbones tags Kirk Storm, 
all the time never stop looking in the eyes of Mark Blaze.  Crossbones dives 
out of the way and throws Kirk Storm in the way, the momentum of Blaze pushes 
Storm to the turnbuckle, hard.  Storm is dazed, Blaze runs and dives into 
Storm with the sides of his legs really hard.  Storm weakly pulls himself up.  
Then Storm quickly jumps straight to the top rope, and does a spinning kick 
right off the top rope, catching Mark Blaze off guard.  Storm gets up and runs 
over and does a double elbow drop.  Storm tries to get up but Blaze throws 
Storm to the ground and does a double knee drop, hard onto Storms "private parts"  
the ref didn't see.  Blaze kicks Storm yet again in the balls without the ref 
seeing.  Storm goes for the pin. 1...2....3.  Storm is out, Crossbones is back in.

Johnny: There goes Storm, he'll get more chances for the title, although he wanted 
it now.no duh. god these cue people suck, I really want to meet them sometime.

Crossbones runs in and shoves Blaze to ground and does a 360 leg drop to the neck of 
Mark Blaze.  Crossbones gets up and kicks Blaze hard in the chin, Blaze spits out 
blood and a small piece of his tongue.  Blaze keeps his mouth shut for a little and 
spits the blood right in Crossbones' eyes.  He jumps up and kicks Crossbones in 
the face, causing Blaze's blood and a bit of Crossbones' blood to trickle down to the 
mat.  

Johnny: Blood, who doesn't love it.

Crossbones tries to wipe off his eyes, but Blaze does a reverse roundhouse and 
kicks Crossbones in the back of the head, causing Crossbones to fall straight on 
his nose.  Blaze jumps with his whole body on Crossbones' back and rolls him over 
for the pin, all the time kneeing Crossbones in the side.  1....2...3...and Mark 
Blaze is the new .COM champion.

And the Winner is: Mark Blaze
****************************************************************
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 4: Terror Crew Vr. Purple Haze and Dallas Star--CAREER MATCH!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Johhny: Our last fight was quite a fight, all blood and fighting. Just the 
type of fight that they all should be. But on to o next match, which will 
probably be as good or even better than the first, because careers are on the 
line here! And, we will see a rare happening, as Dallas Star, normally a 
manager will fight as partner of Purple Hayes. So lets see how this one goes, 
but know this, its gonna be a killer fight...And here comes the first tag team, 
the ones with their careers on the line, the self proclaimed bad asses of the 
OWF, the Terror Crew! 

(Engine 9 by Deftones starts playing at a deafening volume over the speakers, 
and on the Bigscreen, Terror Crew appears in menacing letters. Mad Dog runs 
out, followed by Lunatic and Soviet Kid. They slide under the bottom rope 
while the crowd cheers on loudly, and the Terror Crew, all juiced up for the 
fight, are each standing on a turnbuckle while lifting their arms in self 
praise.)

Johnny: Looks like they are all ready to kick ass, but lets see if they will 
be able to, even though the odds are three to two, favor on Terror Crew's side. 
They are fighting the beautiful and talented Dallas Star, but you wouldn't 
care much about that, right Barry? Damn! I forgot he ain't here! Here comes 
Purple Hays and Dallas Star now!

(The arena darkens and purple lights start to fill the arena. Take me Down 
by ICP starts to roar throughout the arena, and from the smoke appearing at 
the ramp entranceway, Purple Hayes appears, followed by Dallas Star, who was 
used to following wrestlers due to her manager position. They walk casually 
and calmly towards the arena, Purple Hayes grabbing his wrists and loosening 
his muscles. The crowd cheers loudly. Dallas Star, close behind, wearing a 
silver two piece bathing suit, with a small tight shorts as the bottom, with 
a star on her ass. All the cheering is replaced by whistling and yelling of 
men at her beauty and revealing outfit. She is only pumped up by this and 
smiles as she climbs under the bottom rope into the ring, where Purple Hayes 
is waiting. )

Johnny: Well both teams are now in the arena and we are ready to go, and Damn, 
I wouldn't be able to wrestle if I were wrestling Dallas! But this is gonna be 
a great match, and here we go lets get ready for the start.

All of a sudden, Mad Dog hits Purple Hayes in the back of the head as he is 
discussing with Dallas about who's gonna fight first. The other two members 
of the Terror Crew jump out as well as Dallas Star.  

Johnny: what a way to start the way.looks like we are underway.
Purple haze and Mad Dog are circling each other in the ring, being a menace to 
each other, looking right in the eyes, then Purple Haze spears Mad Dog all the 
way to the opposite turnbuckle cracking his back like a little plastic toy.  
Mad Dog is on the floor sprawling in pain while Purple Haze punches him in the 
kidneys without mercy.  

Johnny: Purple Haze executes the spear perfect let's see what he'll do-god I 
miss Barry. not in a gay way-like Barry.

Mad Dog then kicks Purple Haze in the "you know where" and Purple Haze falls 
back in pain.

Johnny: Oh shit, oh  shit, Mad Dog just hit Purple Haze hard in the.

Peanut Salesman: Nuts!  Get your nuts!

Johnny: That's got to hurt no matter who you are.

Purple Haze falls down in pain as the weakened and blood spitting Mad Dog 
tags Lunatic to come into the ring.  While Purple Haze is still grimacing in 
pain Lunatic climbs up on a turnbuckle and does an elbow drop.  Pruple Haze 
moves just in time and Lunatic lands straight on his elbow.  Purple Haze, 
still obviously weak, reaches over and makes a tag to Dallas.  She slides under 
the ropes and runs at Lunatic as he is getting up.  He sees her coming and 
picks her up by the waist and does a back body drop.  

Johnny: lunatic executed the back body drop perfectly, looks like Dallas is 
in a bit of pain after this incident….. Lunatic is going to tag Soviet Kid 
now.

Lunatic tags Soviet Kid and then they run back to Dallas and throw her over 
to the ropes and stand, arms locked, in a clothesline waiting for her to come 
back from the ropes, but instead she runs under them rebounds off the opposite 
ropes  and drop kicks them in the back, 1 foot per person.

Johnny: What a move by dallas star, GIVE ME SOME OF THAT SPREAD EAGLE BABY 
YEAH!!!

Soviet Kid rolls out of the ring and Dallas Star drops an elbow to the back of 
Lunatic.  She gets on top of him for the pin- 1........2...but Lunatic breaks 
free and throws her on the floor.  Then he picks her up and bodyslams her onto 
the floor.  He grabs her by the hair and repeatedly smashes her face into the 
floor.  Purple Haze, who is on the sideline is about to go crazy.   He jumps in 
and kicks Lunatic in the face.  Mad Dog and Soviet Kid then run in after seeing 
Purple Haze run in.  Mad Dog grabs Haze in a armlock and Soviet Kid starts punching 
Haze in the face.  Haze then moves his head just in time and Soviet Kid Punches Mad 
Dog, which makes Purple Haze free.  Purple haze then turns around and grabs Mad Dog 
and throws him into Soviet Kid.   He runs to them, seeing that Soviet Kid and Mad 
Dog are dazed a bit.  He runs to them and bashes their heads into each other.  Mean 
hile, Dallas and Lunatic are trading blow by blow to the face.  Lunatic then goes 
for a punch to the chest--obviously forgetting Dallas Star is a girl.

Johnny: Boy I would love to be Lunatic.

Dallas Star looks shocked and gives Lunatic a slap to the nuts, Lunatic is in so 
much pain.

Johnny: Ok, well I would have liked to be Lunatic a few seconds ago.

Lunatic now more angry than pain attempts to do the "Lunatic's Temptation" on 
Dallas, but fails horribly, so horribly that he hurts himself in the process, 
Dallas Star had kicked him in the balls yet again.  

Johnny: Good god! Have mercy child!

Now on the Other side of the ring Purple Haze is dealing with Mad Dog and Soviet Kid 
at the same time.  He karate chops Mad Dog in the Adam's apple and then jumps and 
kicks Soviet Kid in the nose.  Soviet Kid falls down through the ropes and onto the 
ground, noticibly out of it completely.  Then Purple Haze picks up Mad Dog and does 
the Purple Driver, a merciless piledriver.  

Johnny: I think that was a perfect purple pop but I was too busy watching Dallas Star's 
ass.

Dallas runs over and goes for the pin against Mad Dog- 1......2........3.

Johnny:  Well that's it Terror Crew, you guys are gone, good thing to, I don't wanna 
see Dallas Star leave..damn!

Terror Crew: What the hell!

(((Mike walks out)))

Mike: Terror Crew, you have lost the match and your lifespan in this federation.  
You have consitantly broken key rules in the fed, you have been hateful against 
religions, but when you ostrasize someone because of their gender, no one in this fed 
can accept that.  You even said it in a type of OOC comment, which is worsebecause it 
shows your true morals.  I am sorry, but you are expelled from the OWF for life.  
Now get the hell out.

And the Winner is:  Purple Haze and Dallas Star
