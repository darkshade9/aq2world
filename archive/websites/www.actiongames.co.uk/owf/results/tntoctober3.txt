!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tonight, on Taser
Four matches encompass the card tonight, another #1 contendership match for
the .ORG title between Kirk Storm, the current holder, and Mark Blaze, then
there is a regular match with Jack Flagg and Shawn Matthews, although nothing
is ever regular when we are talking OWF, and we have a Hell in a Cell match
with Jekel and Kaos, plus, the main event, the one everyone is talking about,
a Heavens match with Angel and Arch Angel, where they fight 200 feet above the
ring without any ropes at all, a life threatening match, and that one will
be wild...So lets get it on!
****************************************
(((As the fans await what truly will be a groundbreaking event, they can only
imagine what the Pay Per View will be like this sunday, they can hardly 
contain themselves, betweent he PPV, Mike's announcement, and the first ever
dangerous Heavens match they can only wait...finally Mike makes his way to
the ring, the crowd goes apeshit.)))

Mike: Ok, first off, the "mystery match" has sort of been let out the bag, 
and it's Jekel and Kaos in a Hell in a Cell...now onto more news.  Well this
sunday I will be debating the new VP, Hank was fired and I have done basically
everything, I cannot think of one thing Hank has ever done.  Well the new VP
will show up this Sunday at the PPV, so be ready, this guy will help, I can 
tell.

But now, something that will interest tons of you, especially those of you 
who want the World title, we will, tonight, on our webpage be debating OWF 
Survivor, the rules and predetermined by me teams will be on this page, and
this will bring an entirely new element to the sport of wrestling.  In a 
nutshell it consists of 2 teams that have nothing to do with friends or not,
and they have a match against each other every tuesday, then they get to
vote one person out every saturday, much like the hit CBS show.  But the page
will have all the rules and details, I assure you this will bring efeds to 
new heights, FWO did it, and it was ok, but we are making a newer, better
system. 

Cya.
(((Mike walks away, the fans all go nuts.)))
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 1: Kirk Storm Vr. Mark Blaze for #1 Contendership of .ORG title
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny: Well those announcements were interesting, I can't wait to see what 
Mike has to say this Sunday at Back in Busines!

Barry: Yeah..Back In Business will be a great night, there is another match 
I am looking forward to also…

Johnny: Barry…you promised.

Barry: Yeah yeah yeah.  Well our first match is kind of the low part of the 
card, Storm, who is retiring if he looses this match, and Blaze, whom NO ONE 
has heard from.  But it is for £1 contendership of the coveted .ORG title, so 
for that it is a TNT quality match, plus Mike wouldn't have signed them if 
they can't wrestle.

Johnny: Yeah, well here they come.

(((Generic wrestling music comes on and Mark Blaze walks to the ring, no effects, 
nothing special)))

Johnny: Blaze needs to get around to telling the people in charge what he wants 
his entrance to be like!

(((The lights go dim and red strobe lights flash on the entrance way as "last 
Resort" by Papa Roach plays over the p.a. Kirk Storm walks out and stops in 
the middle of the aisle. Slowly, he begins to make his way to the ring....)))

Johnny: At least Storm bothers to get his entrance straight.

The wrestlers do the usual stare off.  Blaze goes for the first lunge, he 
misses.  They circle each other for a little bit.  Storm dives at Blaze, 
Blaze gets out of the way.  Storm gets back up, fakes a dive, and jumps for 
Blaze's leg.  He twists it and brings Blaze down to a leglock.  Blaze shows pain, 
but gets out of the hold.  He gets up and grabs Storm's head.  He turns it into a 
DDT.  Storm looks like he is in pain and blood trickles from his forehead.

Johnny: yawn.  It'll get better.

Blaze gets up and kicks Storm in the forehead, causing more blood to come out of 
the open wound.  Kirk Storm shows pain but gets up, because if he doesn't want to 
loose way more blood he needs to get up.  Mark Blaze charges Storm, Storm did not 
have his feet planted and was not ready for the clothesline, and he flys out of 
the ring.

Johnny: I told you it would get better, did you see that hangtime!

Barry: tight.

The count is at 6 and the Kirk Storm hasn't moved yet.  Blaze sees this opportunity
 and does a frog splash from the top rope.  With all of Storm's momentum he has he 
lifts up his knee to block Blaze's approaching chest.  It worked great.  Blaze 
might have broken a bone.

Johnny: Ouch!  I think that was a broken bone right there, that is deadly!
for the .ORG title will be given to neither of these men until one of them 
wins a future match.  

The count goes to 8 and Blaze pops up, the crowd is shocked.  He hits his chest a 
few times, smiles and jumps back in the ring then jumps back out to ringside, 
restarting the count.  He grabs Kirk Storm and throws him in the ring, then gets 
in himself.  He sets up Kirk Storm in the middle of the ring and then stomps on 
his chest a few times.  He goes to the top rope and does Blazen Glory, a 450 
backflip into a frog splash, and lands it perfectly.  He spits on Kirk Storm and 
goes for the pin. 1........2......3.  And Blaze gets the .ORG contendership.

Barry: Sucks to be Storm.  For one, he is getting pulled out on a stretcher 
now, and for two this was his last match, and he didn't just loose it, he lost 
it and got spit on.  I'll bet this isn't how he wanted it to end.  

And the Winner is: Mark Blaze
********************************************************

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 2: Jekel Vr. Kaos: Hell in a Cell
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barry: Well, our last match was great, no less of a suspenseful thrill 
ride than the rest. Our next match is between Kaos and Jekel, and im 
sure will be just as entertaining, right Johnny?

Johnny: Sure is, and these new wrestlers who have just joined the OWF 
will be fighting for the first time against each other, lets see how 
this one goes.  Its in a cage, except the cage is all caged up.  It even 
has a roof on it so there is no possible way of escaping...Here comes 
the first wrestler!

((The lights go out and on the PA System blares 4..3..2..1..0 and The 
way I am by EMINEM hits. The strobe lights flicker and from the entry 
way walks a figure. He gets to the ring through the caged door goes to 
the corner and raises his hands.  The crowd cheers in approval, and he 
walks around the ring, waiting for his opponent.  Then all the lights in 
the arena dim.  All of a sudden it is bathed in a dark purple light. 
Jekel walks out of the wrestlers entryway, and walks through the entrance 
door of the cage, and spins around slowly with his arms extended and 
his hands open))

Johnny: And our two wrestlers are now here, just waiting for the 
bell...

((The ref, outside of the cage, rings the bell and the fight starts.
Jekel turns around to face Kaos, but is greeted by a fist in his face.  
He stumbles back, then retaliates with a spear to Kaos's stomach.  
Right before he hits, Kaos grabs Jekels shoulder, stoppping dead in his 
tracks, lifts him up by the wasit and piledrives him into the ground, 
hitting Jekels head hard into the floor [Remember lunch, Mike? inside joke]  
Kaos backs away, laughing.  He turns and looks to the crowd for their 
support.))

Johnny: Damn that musta hurt! Looks like Kaos is sooping up the crowd, 
but wait, Jekel is getting up...

((Jekel gats up, and kicks Kaos in the back hard.  Kaos grabs his back 
in pain, and Jekel takes one of Kaos' hands and throws him into the 
"ropes". Kaos hits the mesh lining hard, and Jekel runs at him and does a 
flying drop kick on Kaos's chest.  Kaos falls down in pain.  Jekel goes 
down for the pin...1....2.....and Kaos shakes him off.))

Barry: Kaos almost got pinned down there, but the fight continues...

((Kaos gets up and him and Jekel trade blow for blow to the face and 
stomach for about one minute straight.  Then Kaos grabs Jekel and kness 
him in the stomach.  He the clasps him hands together and double fisted, 
hits Jekel in the back of the neck, knocking Jekel down hard.  Jekel is 
on the floor, barely concous, and Kaos, taking notice, starts to walk 
towards the wall of the cage to climb it.  Jekel, though, formulates 
enough strength to grab Kaos's leg and trip him har flat on his face.  
Kaos uses his other leg to kick Jekel in the face, making Jekel let go.))

Johnny: Koas is climbing the cage, whats he gonna do?

Barry: I dunno, I just dont know...

Johnny: It was a rhetorical question man.

((Kaos climbs the cage while a tired Jekel lays on the floor. Many 
wonder why Kaos does not go for the pin, but are anxouis to see what he has 
in store.  Jekel starts slowly to get up, and he is on his knees, 
spitting a bit of blood.  Kaos in now at the highest point and begins to 
climb the roof upside down, like spider man))

Johnny: Excuse the language, but, WHAT THE FUCK??

Barry: Kaos is 15 ft up on the roof, and hanging upside down by his 
hands and feet...what the hell is he plannig?

((Jekel, still on his knees, feels a spit fall on his head and looks 
up.  Kaos then lets go of his grasp on the roof and drops right on the 
kneeing Jekel, with an elbow hard to Jekels neck.  Jekel is out cold, and 
Kaos barley able to move his badly hurting body somewhat on top of 
Jekel. Once Kaos is on top of the unconcious Jekel, the ref 
counts...1......2......3.... and the winner is Kaos!  Paramedics come to remove 
them both on strecheres as they are not able to walk back out of the stage...

Johhny: Well for starter, that was quite an exciting match dont u think 
Barry?

Barry: Hell yeah it was...Very good indeed.

And the Winner is:  Kaos
********************************************************

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 3: Jack Flagg Vr. Shawn Matthews
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny: Well our next match is between Jack Flagg and Shawn Matthews!

Barry: Damn straight it is.  But anyways, here comes Jack Flagg!

(((Flagg wals out and as he walks toward the ring, he passes by two devices on 
either side of him, that shoot up flames as he walks by. The line the aisle 2/3 
if the way down to the ring.)))

Johnny: And here comes his opponent, Shawn Matthews!

(((The arena goes black. Then on the screen above the entrance the word WARNING 
flashes in red. Firworks shoot straight up on each side of the entrance & Danger 
Zone starts to play. As the lights come on Shawn is standing looking straight 
at the entrance. He walks down the to the ring looking around the arena. He 
slides underneath the ropes & spreads his arms wide open & turns 360 degrees 
around looking at the whole entire arena.)))

Johnny: Well  a little bit of history, during the match last Saturday to see 
who would become the opponent of Angel at the PPV, Jack Flagg ran in and tried 
to give the match to Bloodshed by landing his sweet finisher on Matthews, and 
it almost worked, but Mike caught it and wouldn't let that go down, so he took 
away the spot of Bloodshed at the PPV and gave it to Matthews.

The match starts and Matthews goes for a lock up.  They lock up and Matthews 
tries a suplex, but instead Flagg gets it.  Flagg gets up and jumps on Matthews' 
chest.  Matthews uses his grab the ankle move and gets Flagg to the ground.  
He looks for applause from the audience but receives none.  He spits out at 
them and continues his onslaught on Flagg.  Flagg uses Matthews' commonly 
used move, the ankle grab, to get Matthews off of him.

Johnny: That ankle grab…I don't think it is official, but it works none the 
less.

Flagg goes to the top rope and attempts a flip, but lands on his back.  Matthews 
tries a flip but Flagg gets out of the way and Matthews lands on his back.  
Matthews gets up at about the same time as Flagg.  The both run into the ropes, 
when they meet Flagg goes for the clothesline, but Matthews ducks under it and 
does a back back suplex on Flagg.  Flagg's back bounces a foot off the mat.

Barry: Great reversal, real technique there.

Shawn Matthew goes for the pin: 1.........2.. and Flagg give's Matthews a low 
blow, obviously making Matthews get up.

(((Backstage, Bloodshed and Mustafa are watching the match)))

Bloodshed: Hells no bitch!  That shit ain't gonna go down like dat!

Mustafa: uh ok.

Mustafa runs to the ring distracting the ref, a few seconds later Bloodshed 
runs out and nails Jack Flagg in the knees. 

Bloodshed: (to Flagg)  Nothing against you, but I can handle my own matches, you 
made me loose my match, a big match, and even though you didn't mean to you 
fucked me over.  (Matthews laughs)  Shut the hell up bitch. (Bloodshed shoves 
Matthews and runs off…Mustafa stops arguing and walks away.) 

Matthews kicks Jack Flagg in the knees some more and then goes to a top rope and 
does a moonsault and a half (landing back first) to knock out Flagg.  Matthews 
goes for the pin: 1........2........3  and Matthews is the winner.

And the Winner is: Shawn Matthews
********************************************************

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 4: Angel Vr. Arch Angel -- Heavens Match (in the rafters above the ring)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny: This is the one I am looking forward to.  Look back at the greats, Mick 
Foley, his hell in a cell match, but more recently, look at the death of Owen 
Hart, both intertwine in the fact that they both fell.  Owen fell from about half 
way down from the rafters, while these guys are fighting from the top of the 
rafters, with no ropes.  Anything can happen, and I can gauruntee you Angel will 
surprise us.

Barry: Yeah, falling…sucks…

(((The lights flash really bright, then they go back to normal and Angel is in 
the ring)))

Johnny: Not a big entrance guy is he.

(((As the intro of "What If" is played Arch Angel can be seen coming out of the 
back to look at the crowd. All of a sudden flashes of light are seen all around. 
Fireworks are seen from every direction. As they begin to end Arch steps out of 
the back and begins his way to the ring.)))

Johnny: Ok, now they will be raised to the rafters by ropes, which they will cut 
with scissors that were given to them once they get up there, they must throw 
the scissors down when they cut the rope.

The ropes come down, there is no harness, they just need to use their muscles to 
hold on.  Arch Angel looks angry, while Angel looks in pain but at peace he rolls 
his eyes back and let the ropes pull him up as he holds on with his hands, while 
Arch Angel holds on with his arms, and feet.  At about 1/4 the way up, when they 
are about 50 feet up, Angel starts swinging.  The refs yell for him to stop, he 
swings back and fourth, inching closer to Arch Angel…Arch Angel gets more angry 
and starts screaming profanitys.  Angel climbs up the rope more as he is swinging.  
Finally he swings right above Arch Angel, he jerks the rope and lets go, about 
75 feet up, and kicks Arch Angel in the face, grabs the bottom of Arch Angel's 
rope, and jumps to his own rope.  Angel say something to Arch Angel, Arch Angel gets 
even more mad.  Angel smiles and jumps down, falls about 15 feet, then grabs on the 
ropes again, laughing, evily but the crowd loves it.  The whole time they are 
chanting Angel, with no sign of Arch.  

Barry: Don't you think it is weird as of late at how the fans have embraced Angel 
through his hard times?  He isn't exactly a face, but as we can see, he isn't a heel.

Johnny: Yeah, Angel has to be one of my favorite wrestlers out here, basically 
cause he keeps me guessing, I have no clue where he is taking everything, and that's 
what I like, you can tell the guy is in it for the long run.

Finally they get to the top and Angel pulls himself up to the rafters, the rafters 
are about 4 feet wide.  Arch Angel slowly pulls himself up, as any sane person 
would.  They are about 10 feet from each other, with 1 rafter between them.  
Arch Angel looks around to choose his path, logically, but Angel jumps to the
 rafter between them.  Now there is just a gap, Arch tries to get the long way, 
but Angel dives through the gap, but can't quite make it.  He grabs with his 
fingers on the edge, and smiles,  the camera men look nervous, you can tell by 
how the camera is shaking.
(((cut to awesome far away shot of the arena, with the tiny body of Angel hanging 
on the very top so you can see how high he really is)))

Angel throws himeself back up, they stare at each other.

Johnny: This is the coolest match I have ever seen in my life.

Arch Angel does a Vertical Suplex, and holds Angel in the air for a little, he 
starts to loose his balance…they both start to fall.  Angel sees a pole connected 
to the ceiling and grabs it with his feet, right as Arch Angel and him fall off 
the rafter.  Arch Angel falls, but grabs Angel's leg.  Angel is holding on to the
 pole by the feet, while Arch Angel is holding onto Angel's neck, while they are 200 
feet above the ground…this is a life or death situation.  Angel uses his momentum 
and throws Arch Angel off of him, Arch Angel flys and grabs a rafter, and slowly pulls 
himself up.

(((cut to cool camera angle of Angel 200 feet above, and you see the roof, and 
the floor, with Angle hanging on top, while Arch Angel watches)))

Angel is still holding on by his feet, but then lets go, but not before pulling up.  
For a bit less than a second no part of his body is touching anything, but he 
swings himself up, and grabs the pole with his hands to have a firmer grip.  
Arch Angel is amazed.  Angel grins and throws himself over to Arch Angel, he 
tackles Arch Angel and Arch Angel falls over the edge, but Angel grabs Arch
 Angel's  hand.  Arch Angel looks up at Angel, begging for mercy and not let him 
drop, Angel smiles, and uses all of his weight to pull up Arch Angel, but in the 
process he fell over the opposite side of the rafter, now Arch Angel is grabbing 
on to Angel, keeping Angel from plumeting.

Barry: Whoa…I am speechless…I just don't know what to say, this match is the most 
unique and dangerous match I have ever seen in my life.

Angel pulls himself up and grabs Arch Angel by the head with his feet, but slips 
and now is hanging onto Arch Angel's head, only with his feet.  

(((cut to cool camera angle)))

Johnny: Ok, I have seen enough, someone stop this madness!  Someone is going to 
die!  

Angel grabs onto the rafter and pulls himself up.  Both wrestlers are so exausted 
that they can't move, they just lay there on the rafters.  The fans start 
shouting for Angel.  Angel gets up and starts walking away, weakly, but Arch 
Angel grabs Angel's foot, to keep him near, but Angel wasn't expecting that.  

(((cut to cool camera angle.)))

Barry: ahhh come on, we can't even see the wrestlers with this angle this time!  
Wait a minute, oh my god, I see Angel!

You see the tiny figure of Angel fall all the way from the rafters, and land face 
first onto the mat, forming  a bloody, mutilated, indistinguishable carcass of the 
dead Angel, with cuts his chest and back and all from his previous encounters with 
him who is known only as he.

Johnny: oh my god. Folks, I am so sorry, this was not part of the script, Angel was 
supposed to be ready for Arch Angel to grab is ankle, I have no clue what went wrong.  
Oh my god.

Barry: Yes folks, out of character and all, this is not right.  I never agreed with the 
idea of this match, but Angel wanted it, and folks, no one should ever have to see 
what we all just did, we can smell the dead body.

(((Mike runs out to the arena with a white blanket, and throws it over Angel's
 body, kneels down and says a prayer.)))

Mike: Ladies and Gentleman, this was not supposed to happen, and I am so sorry 
for this.  You see, Angel and I never were too good friends, we didn't despise 
each other as our characters did, but we weren't exactly friends…but none the 
less, I did respect this man more than you could imagine.  He never let me down. 
 He always put 100% effort into anything he needed to do.  If I booked a match 
for him, he would be there, if I told him he needed to make a public appearance- 
(Mike sniffs a bit and a tear falls down his cheek)  - Well you see, he would 
always be there.  Angel was a good man, he had problems, but he never made them 
anyone elses.  Now I hate to have to talk about this, but on the Pay Per View 
there was supposed to be a match between Angel and Shawn Matthews for the World 
title. (starts crying a little bit more) -well, but…Well you see, obviously 
that won't happen, so I think I will give it to Purple Haze, who has been in 
this since the beginning, a rarity, infact, Angel was with us since the beginning, 
and well he wants it a lot and has been asking for it, so Haze, you get what 
you want…although I wanted to wait till Hell or Highwater (next PPV) to give you 
what you wanted…Now I would like to have a minute of silence for Angel as the 
EMT's carry his body away....................................................
.......... .................................................(crying now) 
 Angel, I am sorry for allowing you to have this match, I know you wanted it, 
but I also knew that it was wrong, I should have stopped it, I could have 
stopped it.  I am sorry. (Mike walks out, crying with his hands over his eyes 
to wipe off the tears)

Johnny : My cue card says me to say  "well it looks like we will never know 
who he was" but that is just sadistic at a time like this.

And the Winner is: Arch Angel
