!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(((The lights dim as the entire crowd sits, and waits in Miami Florida for 
their chance to see the OWF Live.  The crowd can't wait the night that is 
approaching.  Last Saturday Bungalow Bill made history by being the first man 
to be banished from the OWF Survivor pool.  Now, tonight, a new challenge is 
set forth, a challenge of trust, where both teams must choose who they want 
to represent them.  Finally Mike's music comes on, and the event has begun 
THX proudly presents: [Logo animation] OWF TUESDAY NIGHT TASER)))

Mike:  It is quite a gratification and a relief to come here every Tuesday, 
to come here and see that it is a full house.  I have really progressed ever 
since I was a teenager.  I have moved up, I'm happy with my life.  But I 
didn't come here to tell you all about how I enjoy my life…I came here to 
introduce the event.  Tonight we have a few matches for you.  5 to be exact.

Voice: 6.

Mike: uh no, 5 I should know, I booked the event myself.

Voice: No, 6, and trust me, I know.

Mike: Saynt is that you?

Voice: Saynt?  Hells no beotch.

Mike: come on out Bloodshed.

(((Bloodshed's music comes on and he walks to the ring)))

Bloodshed: Yo Mike, you forgot a match.

Mike: No I didn't.

Bloodshed: Yes you did, why ain'ts you been putting me in matches lately?

Mike: Never got a request from you.

Bloodshed: Just shut the fuck up.  I'm going to have a match tonight 
whether you like it or not, it's going to be me vr. Dirty Russian, got it?

Mike: uh ok.  Fine, it'll be later, is that ok.

Bloodshed: uh yeah, I didn't be expectin you to go along wit this like that.  
Oh well I gots my match, I'm out.

Mike: Yeah, you go out.

(((Bloodshed gives Mike an angry look as he walks away.)))

Mike: But anyways, we got a great show for you tonight!  SIX matches!  And 
of course, the Survivor match!  Who will win immunity?  Who works best as a 
team?  Oh well, here we go [Logo Animation: OWF TUESDAY NIGHT TASER]

(((Mike leaves and the event begins)))
=============================================================================
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 1: Bungalow Bill Vr. Dread X Vr. Jack Gambino
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Johnny: Mike's pretty prompt to say something he wants to say.

Barry: Damn straight-fag.

Johnny: That's it man, I promised myself if you gave me shit I wouldn't take 
it today.

Barry: Ohhhhh--too bad for you, Mr. "I'm afraid because Barry kicked my ass"  
You suck man, I don't know how you wrestled back in the 80's it probably wasn't 
even wrestling, it was gay homosexual activities

Johnny: That's it, I'm out

Barry: What the hell is that supposed to mean

Johnny: I'm out I'm going to do what I call a Barry.

(((Johnny walks out of the arena, obviously referencing the time Barry lost 
it and couldn't take constantly being made fun of by Johnny, well this time 
it is switched around and Johnny is leaving)))

Barry: Hey Johnny, where the hell do you think you are going??? (((Johnny 
keeps walking))) Do you want me to kick your ass or something like at the 
Pay Per View??? (((Johnny doesn't come back))) Well this shit sucks, I won't 
do this shit alone…sorry Mike, but you're without commentators for the 
night…blame it on Barry.

(((All of a sudden, Break Stuff by Limp Bizkit blares over the PA system, 
volting the fans to their seats. They all await the arrival of Dread X, 
a new up-and-coming superstar in the OWF, who will wrestle his first 
match in just a few short moments. During the chorus of the song, fireworks 
begin to burst all around the arena as Dread X appears from behind the
curtain. He runs to the top of the ramp and pours a bottle of water onto his 
head, drenching his upper body. The fans cheer at the display, as he then runs 
down to the ramp and slides into the ring. He rises to his feet, and makes 
his way over to one of the turnbuckles, lowering his head onto the semi-soft
surface.)))

(((Just then, the lights go out, as gold jacks begin to spin in the middle 
of the entranceway. Gold and black fireworks explode on the stage, revealing
the giant Jack Gambino standing in center. He raises his arms to reveal his 
massive arms))) 

But just as he gets them up Bungalow Bill rushes him from behind, knocking him 
to the floor with a steel briefcase! Gambino quickly recovers from the cheap 
shot, and turns to face Bill, attempting to intimidate his not-so-small opponent. 
The two then begin to duke it out, pitting tact versus raw power. Of course, 
after a few punches, Bill decides to kick Gambino in the stomach, knocking the 
wind out of him. He then grabs him by the head, and DDT's him onto the 
unforgiving supports, giving him the upper hand. 

Just then the bell rings, showing that the match has officially begun, as the 
referee begins to administer the ten count. Bill hears the chant, and picks 
Gambino up from the ground, guiding him down to the ring by his head. He picks him 
up onto his shoulder, and attempts to ram his head into the ringpost, only to be 
reversed and shoved into it. He falls to the floor, as Gambino grabs him by the 
sides of his head and pulls him up.

Just then, Dread X performs a perfect baseball slide into his two adversaries, 
knocking them to the floor. He quickly grabs Bill and rolls him into the ring. He 
follows in after him, and quickly pulls him to his feet. He then begins to punch Bill 
into the corner, adminstering a swift beating to the "x" salesman. Just than, Ace 
Gambino runs in from the back, and heads
toward Jack. He hands him something, and jumps onto the ring apron, and after 
schemingly distracting the referee, Jack slides into the ring, and runs toward Dread X.
 X sees him, and quickly dismounts Bill, causing 

Jack to slam his fist into Bills face. Bill slowly pulls himself off of the mat, 
revealing the blood pouring from his forehead. Gambino looks down at Bill, and then at 
X, who by that *time was already right next to him. X kicks Gambino in the gut, and 
picks him up in a Powerbomb position. He runs foreward, and slams Jack into the mat, 
just as the referee turns around to see X on top of Gambino for the pin. He slides 
down to his stomach, and slaps the mat three times, pitting Dread X the winner over 
this match!*

And the Winner is: Dread X

Match 2: Night Crawler Vr. Johnny No Where- Hardcore
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Shortly after the last match, the Titan Tron lights
up, showing the Hardcore match scheduled for tonight and shows Johnny No Where 
and Night Crawler outside.*

Johnny No Where and Nightcrawler are locked up, fighting each other.  No Where 
wins it and throws Night Crawler into the trash can.   Night Crawler hits the 
floor, No Where goes over and lifts up the can, he lifts it over his head and 
smashes it into the head of Night Crawler. Night Crawler shows pain as a few 
trickles of blood go down his forehead.  Night Crawler gets up and sweeps Johnny 
No Where in the legs, causing No Where to hit the ground hard.  No Where hits 
the back of his head on the pavement, Nightcrawler gets up, he looks towards 
the traffic buzzing by where they are fighting.  He smiles.

He lifts up No Where and does a suplex, getting Night Crawler ever closer to the 
dangerous traffic.  The camera shifts around to the side of the traffic so you
 cannot see what or how much traffic is going by.  Nightcrawler gets up and grabs 
No Where.  He punches No Where several times and with all of his momentum he 
throws No Where into the traffic.  

The camera shakes as he gets out of the way of the approaching Johnny No Where, 
the camera turns to show the traffic only to see a bus had been parked right 
behind the camera and was picking up people.  No Where goes right onto the bus 
and Night Crawler follows, but just as No Where gets on the bus the driver closes 
the door.  The bus starts to pull out, all this time No Where is sitting in the 
chair, getting his energy back.  Night Crawler backs up and breaks the door of 
the bus and walks in, shortly after the camera man walks in too.

Night Crawler walks up the steps, but he doesn't see Johnny. Night Crawler 
cautiously walks down the isle, waiting for No Where to jump out of no where.  
Night Crawler even asks the camera man if he saw where he went.  Night Crawler 
goes all the way down the isle and no one is in the last seat, all of a sudden 
there is a wind gust as Night Crawler sees the legs of Johnny No Where going 
up the fire escape to the top of the bus.  Night Crawler turns around, pushes 
the camera man aside and tries to grab No Where's legs, but he couldn't get 
there in time, he goes up to the top of the bus, No Where greets him with a 
shot to the head.

As Nightcrawler and Johnny No Where are battling it out on top of a bus Night 
Crawler delivers a strong thrust kick to the chest of No Where, knocking him 
senseless. No Where falls off of the bus, and lands on a pile of boxes, 
cushioning his fall. The mammoth Night Crawler than looms over his adversary, 
perched atop the bus.

He gazes down at No Where, until finally diving off, delivering a giant elbow 
to his now near unconcious opponent. He then grabs him by the head, lifts him up
off of the ground, and throws him farther down the parking lot, causing No Where 
to roll a ways down the concrete surface. Night Crawler than yells for No Where 
to get up, but to no avail. He finally just lifts him up, and delivers the Nine 
Hells, rendering No Where unconcious. The referee than administers the three count, 
as several officials flock No Where, checking his condition. Night Crawler appears 
to be one the dominant forces here in the OWF. Quite impressive indeed.*


And the Winner is:  Night Crawler

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 3: Marasmus Vr. Kaos--.ORG title
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(((Speaking of impressive... As the fans begin to settle down from the last 
match the lights fade to black, as an eerie red light begins to flash around the 
arena. It settles on the entranceway, as Lizzy Borden appears from the back. 
Just as the music hits, Marasmus makes his way through the curtain, as Lizzy 
begins to accompany him down to the ring. Marasmus slides under the bottem rope, 
stands up, and holds the ropes for Lizzy. As she climbs in, she makes sure to 
flash her
ass and breasts at the audience by bending all of the way over. The male fans 
explode with cheers, as Marasmus cracks a small smile.)))

(((After he has been introduced as the .ORG Champion, Kaos appears at the top of 
the ramp. Mic in hand, he raises it to his mouth and begins to speak.)))

Kaos: Marasmus, this is our match. It's Hardcore. We can do whatever we want. 
And right now, I want you to make your way back here, and fight me... in the 
Boiler Room! See you later, pal...

(((Marasmus gazes at Kaos, before flinging himself from the ring to the floor. 
He begins to walk up the ramp, in hot pursuit of his adversary. The fans seem to 
be growing louder by the second, urging the two men to beat the Hell out of 
each other. Both men are sure that that will happen, but who shall give first, 
is yet to be decided... )))

As Marasmus makes his way through the curtain, he breaks into a light jog, not 
wanting to waste any time. After several minutes, he finally finds the boiler room. 
He opens the two steel doors, and enters the "arena", hoping to find Kaos before 
Kaos finds him. 

After he rounds the first set of tanks, he finds Kaos. Laying in a heap on the 
floor, he appears to have been beaten badly. He slowly edges his way over to his 
downed opponent, and rolls him onto his back... Mistake... As he does, Kaos 
spits warm liguid all over Marasmus' face, temporarily blinding him. Kaos leaps to 
his feet, and grabs Marasmus' head, making sure to ram it into every hard 
substance he can find. He finally grabs a lead pipe from the barrage of items 
flooding the room, and swings it at Marasmus, only to miss. 

Marasmus ducks the attack, and heads to the southern hemosphere of Kaos, as Kaos 
lets out a loud cry of agony. Marasmus then executes a Pump Handle Drop to Kaos, 
sprawling him out on the floor. He sees a ladder, and retrievesit from its current 
position.  He sets it up just in time to be strong clotheslined from behind by 
Kaos, knocking both men to the floor for the time being.

Marasmus gets up just a split second before Kaos, giving him time to deliver a 
strong punch to Kaos' temple, and then an axe-kick to the back of his head, knocking 
him to the floor. Marasmus then begins to climb the ladder. He makes it about 
halfway up, turns around, and performs a guillotine leg-drop onto Kaos. Marasmus than 
goes for the pin, but to no avail. Kaos kicks out at the two count, and apparently gets 
a little boost of energy. He rises up, and drop-kicks Marasmus, then begins to ascend 
the ladder.  But, so does Marasmus. Both men scaling opposite sides of the steel 
structure, Kaos arrives at the top first. He then delivers several strong blows to 
Marasmus, reeling the champion. Just as it appears Marasmus is going to fall, Kaos 
throws a shot that is ducked by Marasmus, and turned into a superplex. He then lifts 
Kaos off of the ladder, and flings him through the air, making sure that he stays 
mounted onto the ladder. As Kaos collides with the concrete floor, Marasmus performs 
a revised version of Jeff Hardy's Swanton Bomb, but instead, he turns it into a 450.

When he lands, he bounces off of Kaos, and roles a ways away. Both men lay motionless 
for several minutes, before Marasmus pulls himself up, and lifts Kaos off of the 
ground. He then sets him up for the Marasmic, but as opportunity knocks, Kaos answers 
with an eye couge. He then delivers the Kaotic, sending Marasmus through a pile of 
wodden crates. He falls down, trying to buy himself some time to recover before getting 
the pin. He wastes almost no time in the long run, and goes for the pin on Marasmus, 
but as he does, Lizzy jumps on top of him, and starts smacking the back of hid head. 
He than rises up, and throws her through the air. He begins shouting profanitys at her, 
and walks closer and closer to her with every word. As he comes within arms length, 
Lizzy begins to run backward, before stopping at a wall.

Kaos then flips her off, and turns around... Only to meet Marasmus unforgiving steel 
pipe to the gut. Marasmus than executes the Marasmic, knocking Kaos into a state of 
unconciousness. He then covers his opponent, 1... 2... 3! Marasmus retains his belt, 
as Lizzy accompanies him back to the locker rooms.*

And the Winner is: Marasmus, the reigning .ORG Champion

Match 4: Bloodshed Vr. Dirty Russian
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(((Mike comes to the empty commentator table)))

Mike: Here's the story:  We don't have anyone to be a commentator and you 
guys at home deserve one, so here I am...giving you the play by play, or
whatever the hell I want to talk about.  

(((BLOODSHED ENTRANCE)))

Mike: Ok, here's some of the story between me and Bloodshed: The dude is
tough, I thik we all know that.  But what you don't know is exactly how he
got in jail, and to my knowledge, Dirty Russian doesn't have anything to do
with it, but someone else in the fed does, I don't even know the story, you
see Bloodshed isn't the most...how should I put it...socially friendly guy
out there, so I don't get much out of him, he wants something, and the guy
demandsd I give it to him, but the funny part of it is, he acts like he is 
demanding something I would never give him, but if he didn't demand the 
stuff I would still give it to him...and now for the second opponent-

(((DIRTY RUSSIAN ENTRANCE)))

Mike: I don't know much about this guy except-wait, Dirty Russian isn't 
going to waste any time!

Dirty Russian was walking slowly from the ramp and all of a sudden sprints
to the ring, charging a not ready Bloodshed with a spear, except Bloodshed
held his ground and instead of falling right away he just was pushed back
to the turnbuckle, where Dirty Russian climbs to the top ropes and starts 
punching Bloodshed: 1.....2...........3.........4......5....and before the
sixth punch Bloodshed grabs Dirty Russian's ankles and does a huge powerbomb
on Dirty Russian from the top ropes.  Dirty Russian looks dazed and
Bloodshed grabs his ankle.  He twists Dirty Russian's legs around into a 
boston crab.  Dirty Russian screams for mercy, but doesn't give.  Dirty 
Russian starts trying to over power Bloodshed's massive arms, and Bloodshed
shows, for once, signs of fatigue in a submission. 

Mike: Wow, not many people can get Bloodshed to let go without getting to 
the ropes...Dirty Russian could be one to do it...

Bloodshed starts to sweat a little as Dirty Russian screams louder and uses
more power to get out of the submission, finally, Dirty Russian flips 
Bloodshed to the ground with his legs and jumps onto Bloodshed's shoulder
with his knees.  Bloodshed grabs his shoulder in pain, and Dirty Russian
runs into the ropes.  As he approaches Bloodshed, Bloodshed snaps his body
up and jumps at Dirty Russian with a solid clothesline, knocking Dirty 
Russian right to the floor, Dirty Russian's head snapping hard as it hits 
the ground.  Bloodshed looks around, he doesn't get much of a response from
the audience.  Dirty Russian grabs something from his pants and it appears
to be some kind of wrench.  Then Angel runs to the ring and the crowd goes
wild.  Angel dives in to the ring and grabs the wrench, without touching 
either Bloodshed nor Dirty Russian, he gives the wrench to the ref and the 
ref shows a sign of gratitude.  The ref can't call anything because Dirty
Russian didn't do anything with the wrench and the match continues.  Angel
walks away as the crowd goes wild at one of their favorite superstars.

Mike: Angel...that guy...the crowd loves him, I am not sure why, he never 
once asked for them to like him, they just sort of adopted him without him
doing anything about it.

Dirty Russian slides under Bloodshed's legs and does a suplex from behind.
Bloodshed looks dazed and Dirty Russian gets up.  He goes to the top rope
and does a senton splash and immidiatly gets back up and goes for a senton
bomb-and lands it.  Bloodshed starts coughing, not blood, just coughing.
Dirty Russian gets some momentum and runs into the ropes and comes back with
a bulldog right on Bloodshed's face.  Dirty Russian drags Bloodshed closer
to the ropes and then does a backwards rope spring (a back flip when using 
the ropes to get height)  He lands it nicely and goes for the pin: 1......2
...........and Bloodshed barely kicks out in the nick of time.  Bloodshed
punches Dirty Russian in the face, closed fisted, the ref missed it, and 
throws his head into the ropes.  Dirty Russian falls into the ropes, the
two ropes wrap around his neck and he can't breathe.

Mike: Uh oh...the Prez would stop all this...the Prez would be like, come on
this isn't fair.  Too bad we only have 1 commentator and no prez tonight.

Bloodshed runs into the opposite side of the ring's ropes and come back, he
throws his body into Dirty Russian's stomach, Dirty Russian shows pain but
the ropes are set free and he gasps for air.  Bloodshed bends down just a
little to get withing punching range but Dirty Russian, with everything he 
has, grabs Bloodshed's head with his feet and does a head scissors, planting
Bloodshed's head into the mat.  Dirty Russian meanders over to the top rope
and sort of falls off of it--right onto Bloodshed--elbows first.  Bloodshed
jumps off the ground right after the shot, but falls back down immidiately.
Dirty Russian crawls over to Bloodshed and goes for the pin: 1.........2....
................3.  And Dirty Russian wins it.

And the winner is: Dirty Russian

Match 5: Marasmus and ?????????? Vr. Lowell DotCom and ?????????????
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(((the lights go out and then an eerie red light fills the ring and enterance 
way. the music plays and red mist fills up by the curtains leading from the 
backstage to the arena. a womanly figure step throught the mist and stops. when 
she stops, MaRaSmUs comes out in perfect tune with the music. they make their 
way to the ring, and MaRaSmUs goes between the ropes as lizzy uses the steps. 
MaRaSmUs then lifts the bottom rope for lizzy and she bends all the way over 
and under, much to the delight of the male audience.)))

Marasmus: Yo Mike, I don't got a partner, hook me up.

Mike: (at the commentator table) I don't think I can do that man, I mean I am 
just a commentator

Marasmus: Giggles, yeah, whatever, just get me a partner.

Mike: Uhhhhhh ok.  Let's see howabout Yo!  Purple Haze, get that violet but 
violent ass of yours out here!

(((The Arena goes black, all of the sudden there is an explosion where the 
wrestlers enter from. A single beam of purple light focuses on the entryway and 
Purple Hazeblares over the PA system, Purple Hayes walks out, and a multitude of 
psychadelic colors flash over the crowd, he looks around, then runs full bore to 
the ring, slides under the ropes, runs over to the corners (all four of them, in 
turn) and jumps up to the second turnbuckle and raises his arms out to the side 
with his hands open. He then gets out in the middle of the ring and moons Mike, 
proving infact that his ass is not purple, he grins and the audience laughs, but 
turns away…)))

Mike: Well that was unexpect, and remind me to warn Purple Haze to NEVER do that 
again.

(((The lights in the arena go out, leaving the fans wondering what's coming next. 
Out of nowhere, "Hello Time Bomb" begins to blast over the speakers at the same 
time there's 4 huge blue colored explosions on the stage where Lowell makes his 
enterence. Lowell walks down to the ring, he stands in the middle and throws his 
fist up in the air which is followed byblue flames coming up from each of the four 
turnbuckles.)))

Lowell: Well, unlike my unorginized friend here Marasmus (looks over and grins at 
Marasmus) I do have a partner lined up, he's actually a long time friend of mine, 
his name, Chris Naveed, Chris, come on down!

(((Chris Naveed comes out and walks to the ring)))

Chris: (Sarcastically) So Lowell, you promised me I would get to open up a can of
 whoop ass, when do I get my can of whoop ass Lowell?

Lowell: No Chris, you don't get the can, you just open it on someone, if I were to 
give you one I would have to kick your ass, one day I will teach you how to make 
a can of whoop ass, one day

Chris: Aight, cool.

Lowell DotCom and Marasmus start out in the ring.  Marasmus goes for a spear, but
Lowell gets out of the way.  Lowell runs into the ropes and goes for a diving 
clothesline, but Marasmus dives right under Lowell and rolls up quickly.  Marasmus 
approaches Lowell Dotcom and locks up.  Marasmus goes for the Powerbomb, but in mid 
air Lowell is close enough to Naveeds hand and tags in Naveed, Naveed jumps in 
and goes for a spear to the stomach of Marasmus as Marasmus is holding Lowell for 
a  powerbomb.  Marasmus falls backwards, leaving Lowell Dotcom on top of Marasmus.  
Lowell gets off a few punches to the face and Purple Haze runs in and gets Lowell 
off Marasmus.  Marasmus tags Purple Haze and Purple Haze punches Lowell in the 
face several times.  Purple Haze and goes for an Atomic Drop.  Lowell hits the mat
hard, Chris Naveed runs in and punches Haze several times.  Naveed runs out of 
the ring after the ref warns him.

Haze is on the ground, Lowell goes to the top ropes and sets up, he get's
prepared and turns around on the top rope, he bends his knees and goes for a 
double Moonsault.  He does it but doesn't get it all around and lands backwards
on his feet.  He turns around to be greeted by Haze and Marasmus.  They hit him
with a double clothesline and Lowell falls to the floor.  

Mike: Is that leagal?  Oh well, I don't know, I am the prez--I mean I am the
commentator that thinks that the prez would beleive that that is allowed, you 
know what I mean...don't you ???

Lowell falls to the ground and Marasmus picks him up.  Lowell kicks Marasmus
in the stomach. Marasmus grabs his stomach and Lowell does a knee to Marasmus'
face.  Marasmus hits the ground.  Lowell picks him up and throws him into
the ropes.  Marasmus comes back and Lowell does a back body drop.  Marasmus 
tags in Haze.  Haze charges Lowell but Lowell ducks under the spear and flips
Haze over his head. Marasmus goes to the top ropes once more and turns around
backwards, he bends his knees slowly to keep balance and then with all of his
force he does a double moonsault, and this time makes it all the way around 
twice and lands right on Haze's chest.  He goes for the pin: Marasmus runs
in but Naveed spears him in the side, Marasmus unexpecting it hits the 
ground: 1.......2........3 and Lowell DotCom and Chris Naveed win!

And the Winner is: Lowell DotCom and Chris Naveed

Match 6: OWF SURVIVOR! A Tag Team Match fought for immunity-each team has, 
         or should have, chosen their team.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mike: Ok, time to go into "Prez Mode" 

(((Mike gets out of his commentator chair and goes to the ring.)))

Mike: Ladies and Gentleman, now it is time for the weekly immunity challenge
for OWF Survivor.  This is a tag team match where each team has chosen their
tag team that will be representing them.  This is a chance for these two 
people to shine and become a prized person of the team, and this is also
a chance for people to screw things up for themselves.  The looser of this
match will have to, with the rest of their team, vote one person off the 
team.  Now it is time to announce the Tag Teams that will be representing, 
if you don't know who they are already: For team 1: Saynt and Angel, and for
team 2: Arch Angel and Crag.  By coincidence we have 3 heavenly figures in
this match...and a Crag.  Let's get it on!  Now it is time for me to go back
and be a little happy commentator...shit.

(((Mike walks back to his commentator seat.)))

Mike: Well here comes team 1:

(((Saynt's music comes on, and following shortly after it, Angel's:
Saynt's:
Angel's:  )))

Mike: And team 2...god I hate this job...probably because I suck at it.  I
really need to help straighten out Johnny and Barry's relationship so I 
don't have to do this on a regular basis.

(((Arch Angel's music comes on, shortly afterwards, Crag's comes on:
Arch Angel's:
Crag's: ))) 

The two people starting in the ring are Arch Angel and Saynt.  They both get
ready and circle each other several times.  They lock up.  Saynt gets the 
first move by getting Arch Angel into a half assed head lock.  Saynt lets
go and kicks Arch Angel in the stomach.  He quickly proceeds to do a solid
double arm DDT on Arch Angel, throwing all of his weight into it, at one
point Saynt isn't even touching the mat with ANY part of his body.  Arch
Angel pops up quickly like he isn't hurt, but all at once the pain hits him
and he grabs his forhead and limps around the ring, Saynt charges him with 
a spear and makes Arch Angel go right to the ground.  Saynt goes to the top
ropes and attempts something, but before he can Arch Angel gets up and runs
to the top rope and grabs Saynt and throws him off.  Arch Angel goes to the
top rope himself and goes for a elbow drop to the leg of Saynt, he lands it
right into Saynt's thigh.  Arch Angel does a little flip onto Saynt and gets
up, walks over and tags in Crag, who is anxious to get in, Crag jumps over
the top rope and the minute his two feet touch the mat the crowd goes wild.

Mike: That's you're american hero for you, Miami Florida, like all of the US
loves the guy.  My commentary sucks, that's basically because I am reading
from the cue cards--I know I know, I said I would fire them, but I never got
around to it, sue me.

Crag has tons of momentum going for him, while Saynt has a bit left, but 
that bit is barely enough to get him to tag in Angel.  Saynt knows he won't
make it to Angel in time, so he gets up and Crag goes for a punch, but 
Saynt, with great skill and not much energy blocks it with his wrist.  Crag
goes for another punch, but Saynt blocks it.  Crag goes for a third punch,
rejected, the crowd gets interested in the look of calmness and relaxation
in the eyes of Saynt, he isn't fighting, he is defending himself. Finally
Crag breaks the pattern and goes for a kick.  Saynt grabs Crags ankle and 
twists it, making Crag spin and fall over to the ground. Saynt take a big
breath and runs over to Angel, tagging him in.  The minute Saynts gets out
of the ring he looses all energy he had used and falls over, using the ropes
as leverage from falling all the way down on his back.

Mike: WOW!  Did you see what Saynt did!  That ruled, he one minute was 
really tired, but then focused and defended himself with very little energy,
that, my friends, is skill wrestling right there, he knew he couldn't take
him with power move, and he knew he couldn't take many more shots, so he 
focused on defending himself, and it worked great.

As Angel gets into the ring the crowd also goes nuts.  It is two of their 
favorite wrestlers in the ring, the crowd gets abnormilally silent, probably
because they don't know exactly who they will be rooting for, they just 
watch the match. Angel looks to the crowd, he shakes his head and smiles.
Angel charges Crag and locks up.  Angel wins the tie up and does an arm wrench.
Crag shows a little pain, but kicks Angel in the gut and Angel lets go.  Crag
does a roundhouse kick to Angel's face and goes for a Armbar takedown.  

Mike: Nice, Nice.

As Angel gets back up Crag does an Arabian Facebuster very cleanly.  Crag get up
and goes to the top rope, Arch Angel runs over to the corner and Crag tags him, 
Crag then goes for an Asian Moonsault as Arch Angel runs in and holds Angel 
down, you can tell that Arch Angel doesn't like it, because he is on the good
side of Angel, but Arch Angel does it anyways and Crag lands the Moonsault 
nicely.  Crag leaves the ring and waits to get tagged in again.  Arch Angel goes
for the pin: 1........2.....and Angel jumps out.  Angel does a backwards 
round house onto Arch Angel and runs over to the side and tags Saynt.  Angel
and Saynt grab hands and run right at Arch Angel who is just getting up, but 
Arch Angel ducks under it and gets up quickly and dropkicks Angel from the back.
As he is on the ground he does a leg sweep to Saynt and Saynt hits the ground.
Arch Angel does a knee drop onto Saynt and runs out and tags Crag.  Crag runs
in but Arch Angel isn't done yet.  

Mike: This is it, I SENSE it--as a commentator of course, not the prez.

Crag and Arch Angel do a double elbow drop both right to Saynt's stomach and 
the force of it makes Saynt jump a foot off the mat and go straight back down,
coughing hard.  Arch Angel runs out of the ring and Crag goes for the pin:
1.........2..........3 and Team 2 wins immunity!

And the Winner is: Team 2
*******************************************************

***OOC: I did not make Team 2 win because Team 1 won last week, it is because
I was extremely impressed with how they actually organized their tag team on
the OOC board while Team 1 sort of...well didn't.  I go with the team that I
beleive has been the most active for one, and two, if they actually do work as
a team, and Team 2 really impressed me in this feild.
