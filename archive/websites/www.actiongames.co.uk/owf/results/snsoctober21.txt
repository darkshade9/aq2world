          ---------------------------------------------------
OOC: Sorry for the later results (by like an hour and a half) it's just
today was VERY busy, with SAT's and all in the morning to chilling with 
my friends (yes Prez's chill with their friends too...)

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
****************************************

(((The fans are sitting in their seats, apperently the weather caused many
people, including Mike to arrive late, and of course there cannot be any 
card without Mike, but finally Mike arrived and Surge will be on Saturday 
as always.)))

Mike: Whoa, crazy ride here, (OOC truth- SAT's and got home late) Thanks to 
the help of alot of people this event is made possible (OOC truth- I had
help from people short notice for the matches, thanks guys, you know who
you are.)  But I am here to do one thing, and that is announce who is off
the survivor pool, and it is -

(((Scotty Hinton's music comes on, Hinton walks to ringside)))

Hinton: Listen up Mike, I wanted a match against Trey Stevenson and Crag, 
but it seems I didn't get that, and I wanted it TONGIHT! 

Mike: Yo, why is it I always get inturrupted before I read off the person
voted off Survivor!

Hinton: I don't know, dramatic effect, suspense, whatever.

Mike: Good point.

Hinton: But answer my question!  Why don't I have my match.

Mike: Golly, you are one crazy Canuk!  But anyways, BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE
A TAG PARTNER!

Hinton: Well...I'm sure there is other people out there who would want to
fight with me against these stupid americans, if anyone backstage there 
wants to do it, come out NOW!

(((No response for 30 seconds, then Mr. Tokyo's music comes on and Hinton
looks very suprised)))

Hinton: TOKYO!  NO WAY MAN!  WILL YOU DO ME THE HONOR OF FIGHTING WITH ME
TONIGHT!

Mr. Tokyo: OOOOOOOF course man, we need to show up these Americans, see us
we are of different nationalities, but we are both not american and we can
get along, I don't see why Americans can't get along with other people, are 
they too good for us or something?

Hinton: EXACTLY!

Mike: Well I am american and I'll do you guys a favor, ok, tonight, match, you
two versus Crag and Trey, now go away, plan strategies or something.

(((They both leave.)))

Mike: Ok, and for Survivor, with 1 vote: Hinton and Angel with 2 votes, Scotty
Hintman, and the one who is voted off, with a total of 3 votes...Crossbones!
That was a shocker to me, and hopefully someone tells Crossbones when he arrives,
he hasn't gotten here yet... But Team 1, I don't think it's fair that since Blaze
was fired you guys are out a member and a weaker team, so Tim Star will be taking
Blaze's place, ok? 

Mike: And Tuesday there will be a Royale Rumble and whoever is the winner of that
wins immunity for their entire team, how you like them apples!  Well prepare for
that and Cya guys later!

(((Mike leaves the arena...but then slowly turns around)))

Mike: You know something, Valek has helped me a HELL of alot with matches, 
so, Blade, you are now commish, because that fits your job description better
and Valek, you are VP.  I think this will progress more on the RP board, so
I will leave it for that.

(((Mike Leaves the arena)))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 1: Jekel Vr. Frikizoid--Last Chnace match
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(((The wrestlers walk to the ring)))

The two wrestlers stare each other out.  They charge each other, they both
go for a spear but hit each other in the head, Frikizoid hits the ground 
first and Jekel falls on top of him, both are knocked out. 1.......2......
3 and Jekel wins.

Johnny: Uh oh.

Barry: Yep, I think we know what is coming next...

(((Mike walks to the ring)))

Barry: Yep, just as I thought.

Mike: Ok, well guys, how do I say this...oh I know, I said it about 6 times
last week....Frikizoid!...you are fired.  And for Jekel, you are still in
but better watch it, I am not afraid to fire people, now cya!

(((Shawn Matthews music starts to play. After a few seconds, Shawn's voice is 
heard over the speakers.)))

Matthews: "You two wrestlers are a waste of these fans hard earned money.
Many of them worked over a month to earn the nose bleed seats. Many of them 
worked doing hard, physical, dirty labor & made only 25 cents an hour. Now 
you two enter the ring & try to act as if you people want to see you." 
Shawn then starts to laugh. As he is heard laughing on the speakers he 
sneaks up behind both wrestlers, coming through the fans & under the 
ropes & knocks them both out with a steel chair shot each. Shawn picks 
Jeckel up & delivers light's out to him & then to Frikizoid. Shawn grabs 
a mic out of his pocket. His laughing on the speakers stops. He then 
begins to speak again. This is the OWF 2000 & I am your World Champion. 
You can be damned if you think I am going to let horrible athletes & 
wrestlers live long in my federation. If you don't want to face the same 
punishment as these two, every one of you wrestlers in the back better 
start working your asses off or quit now. This is my federation & none 
of you deserve to be in it, untill you show lots of improvement. I, your 
hero & champion am leading this federation through it's hard times 
right now. I am now 2 up on the virus in this federation, that we'll call 
lack of talent." Shawn then walks back to the locker room while his 
music plays again.


And the winner is: Jekel
***************************************************************************
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 2: Dread X Vr. Crag
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(((Scotty Hinton's voice comes on and he is shown on the Online-Tron)))

Scotty Hinton:  Gag, it is a total shame that I cannot be in that ring 
tonight WHIPPING your ass from post to a-post.  You see The Impecable One 
can't get it out of his mind that I'm the better man.  We've seen that 
I'm the better man.  I've plain out-wrestled you in our match.  If you 
line up our mic skills side by side, I win again due to your totally 
boring America is so great schpeil.  If you line up our looks, I 
DEFINATELY win.  Chicks dig the locks, eh.  So it's plain to see that Scotty 
Hinton will ALWAYS out wrestle you, out talk you, and DEFINATELY out 
class you.  And as far as you piddly little match with Dead X, and believe 
me he wrestles and talks like he's dead, I hope that you have a nice, 
easy match to help you with your jitters about getting into the ring 
with me again.

Johnny: well I think that is the only firing we are going to see tonight...

Barry: At least I hope so....wait, here comes Crag.

(((A little bit of pyro goes off then water rockets shoot off into the crowd 
getting people close buy soaked.)))

Johnny: Yep, and here comes his opponent, Dread X!

(((After Break Stuff hits Dread X walks out and red pyros shoot out of the 
stage. Dread X pours water over his head and walks down top the ring. 
Finisher)))

The bell sounds but neither wrestler moves.  This isn't wrestling; both 
wrestlers are just staring at each other.  Just as that is said Dread X 
lifts his hand to play mercy.  Crag gives a small smile then raises his hand 
to play too.  Just then Dread X hits Crag in the stomach, and as Crag is 
bent over Dread X knees him in the face.  Crag falls to the mat, and cups 
his nose.  Dread walks over the Crag and begins to kick him in the ribs, 
but backs off and makes his way towards the corner.  Crag gets up in pain 
just as Dread is climbing the ropes.  Dread jumps.....and lands a beautiful 
jumping clothesline to Crag.  

Barry: Hey, look Johnny, wouldn't you want to do that, think about it, your
body, Crags body, touching...

Johnny: I really think you are sick man.

Barry: Did I say anything about me?  I was talking about you.

Johnny: and why!!! What did I do!?!?!?

Barry: Oh I don't know, maybe when YOU MADE FUN OF ME!

Johnny: But you kicked my ass.

Barry: And never forget that, now back to the match.

Suddenly the crowd begins to yell.  AAAASSSSS HOOOLLLLEEE, AAAASSSS 
HOOOLLLEEE.  Dread gets furious and begins looking around the shouting 
curses to the audience.  But that was just what Crag needed to regain some 
energy.  Crag slowly gets to his feet and as Dread is on the ropes yelling at 
the audience Crag taps him on the shoulder then boots him in the face.  
Dread hits the mat in just a matter of milliseconds.  Crag then grabs the 
ropes and starts choking Dread with his boot.  The ref counts to 5 and Crag 
lets up and lets Dread get back to his feet.  Crag squares him up and gives 
Dread a punch to the face, another, and another, and another, the with a loud 
CRACK Crag gives Dread an uppercut.  Then Crag goes for the Point of No Return.  

Barry: Can he do it, can he do it, can he do it.

Johnny: That sounds really dumb man.

Barry: Look, do you want another hell in a cell?

Johnny: No.

Barry: Of course you don't, so shut the hell up.

Dread hit the mat hard once again, but this time it's like he can see 
Crag going to the top rope.  Crag jumps but somehow Dread moves out of the 
way.  Crag hits his head on the mat and can barely move.  AAAAASSSSSSSSS 
HHHOOOLLLLLL¦.all around the ring can be heard, but Dread isn't 
phased.  Suddenly Dread pulls Crag to his feet and starts on his X Bomb!  
BOOOMMM  the bomb has worked Crag isn't moving, Dread goes for the count 
1.....2..........3.   THE MATCH IS OVER DREAD WINS!  

Johnny: Both put alot of effort into this match, one person had to come out
on top though.

Barry: Ok, I agree, yes, both men worked their asses off for this one, and
both deserved to win, this time it just happened to go to Dread X though.

And the Winner is: Dread X  
*******************************************************
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 3:  Trey Stevenson and Crag Vr. Scotty Hinton and Mr. Tokyo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny: I am not speaking to you this match.

Barry: Why is that? 

Johnny: Because they got me to come here and commentate for 5 matches, this one
was not planned and I refuse to talk and be made fun of during a match that I 
am not on contract to do, So I just am not talking.

Barry: Well ok...then I'm not talking either...

(((As the fans settle down after what has just taken place, the chorus to 
Country Grammar can be heard over the PA system, as two huge towers of pyro 
erupt near the entryway. Trey Stevenson then makes his way out of the back, 
and makes his way down the ramp slapping every hand in sight. When he comes to 
the ring, he leaps onto the arpon and winks to the crowd))) 

((just as more pyro shoots around the arena. Hydro rockets then begin to explode 
into the crowd, as water splashes some of the spectators. Crag then makes his way 
out from behind the curtain and down to the ring, sliding in several feet away 
from Stevenson, as both both men nod at each other.)))

(((All of a sudden, "Land of the Rising Son" begins to play over the PA system, 
but just as the song begins to get louder, it screeches into "Fight Fire With Fire". 
Mr. Tokyo then walks out from behind the curtain, as pyro shoots off around him. 
He stands at the top of the ramp, awaiting the arrival of his partner.)))

(((After Mr. Tokyo's intro slowly comes to an end, Scotty Hinton comes out... 
But not to his music. He comes out to the music of Trey Stevenson, making sure 
that everything is right. The pyro erupts exactly when it's supposed to, and the
music begins when it's supposed to. Right when Scotty walks out from behind the 
curtain, he begins to blink excessively, making sure that everyone... Including
Stevenson... See it. Both Mr. Tokyo and Hinton begin to make their way down to 
the ring, as Hinton begins to stumble down the ramp, trying to over-emphasize his
impression of Stevenson.)))

Wasting no time, Stevenson and Crag both dive out of the ring, and charge Hinton
and Tokyo, knocking both men to the ground. They begin to pumble their opponents 
into the ground, but just then, Mr. Tokyo flips Crag off of him, and onto his
back. Tokyo then mounts Crag, and begins to pumble him. The four men brawl outside 
the ring for a few minutes, until finally the referee gains control of the four 
men. He sends Tokyo to one corner, and Stevenson to another corner, leaving Crag 
and Hinton in the ring to battle it out. Crag begins on the offensive with a quick 
shot to the head of Hinton, and then a quick short clothesline. He quickly pulls
Hinton up from the mat, and executes a perfect DDT, causing Hinton to bounce off 
of the mat, and land several feet away from Crag. 

Crag then lifts him back up, as Hinton delivers a low-blow, reeling his opponent. 
He then throws Crag to the ropes, and attempts to leap-frog him, only to find 
himself in a powerbomb position. Just then, Stevenson launches himself from the top 
rope, drop-kicking Hinton in the chest, causing Crag to powerbomb him twice as hard.

Mr. Tokyo runs in the ring, only to be stopped by the official, as Stevenson and Crag 
then execute a revised version of the 3-D, knocking Hinton down for a while. The referee 
gets Tokyo out, only to see Crag outside of the ring getting a table, and Stevenson 
choking Hinton. Crag quickly slides the table into the ring, and sets it up. Stevenson 
then goes to help his partner postiion the table, as Mr. Tokyo runs to the referee from 
behind, and knocks him unconcious with a powerful clothelsine. He then jumps onto the table,
and dives toward Stevenson, performing a perfect Heurricanrana. 

Stevenson falls to the outside of the ring, but just as he begins to get back up, Bloodshed
rushes him from behind and hits him in the back of the head with a steel chair. He 
then falls on top of him, and goes for a pin, as everyone assumes Trey vs. Bloodshed is 
underway. The other referee goes for the count, but all of a sudden the lights in the arena
fade to pitch black. They stay out for several minutes, and then come back on, only to see 
every man down. As the referee for the Tag match gets up and looks around, he sees that no 
one is standing so he then begins to administer the ten count. He reaches seven, but just 
then, the lights fade to a blood red... "You Spin Me Round" by Dope begins to blare
over the PA system, as two men, Corinth and Ephesus, appear at the top of the ramp. 
Ephesus then raises a microphone to his mouth, and begins to speak.*

Ephesus: This is a message to every man in the OWF. It is our turn to reign supreme, and 
every man that considers himself Hardcore will feel the effects of our wrath. We are the 
epitome of all that is dark, and soon you shall understand what the dark really is. A
feeling of pain and hatred... Loneliness and fear... We are the evil that you feel inside 
of you when you know that you are performing an evil act. We know all, see all, and feel 
all... We are all... So let us issue a challenge. Any man that wishes to test our ways,
step forth, and prepare to be cleansed. But until then , know that we will always be 
there... We are superior to all of you, so let it known... October 21st, 2000... Our reign 
has begun. Will it last forever... On this day, Armageddon has begun... You are our crops, 
and we are here to harvest every last one of you...

And The Winner Is: Trey Slim Stevenson and Crag
***********************************************

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 4: Trey Slim Stevenson Vr. Bloodshed--Hardcore
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At that, the two men turn around, and walk through teh curtain, as everyone in the arena 
stands shaken by the words that have just been spoken... After the short speech, Crag 
had made his way over to Mr. Tokyo, lifted him off of the ground, and performed the Point
of No Return, right through the table. The referee,who didn't know what to think, saw 
the act, and without any thought, began the long three count. After three slaps of the 
canvas, Crag and Trey Stevenson were declared the winners. Outside of the ring, Trey
and Bloodshed slowly made it to their feet, and began to duke it out with each other, 
only to give Bloodshed the slight upperhand. He then began to beat Trey to the ground, 
but as he turned around, Crag nailed him in the face with the steel chair, knocking 
Bloodshed to the ground. Trey then crawled on top of Bloodshed, and received the 
1... 2... 3!

Barry: HAHAHA!  That was short, sucks to you Bloodshed!

Johnny: You are going to get your ass kicked.

Barry: Nah, no problem, I'll just blame it on you.

Johnny: h-

Barry: just shut up.

And the Winner is: Trey

OOC: This match isn't long... 1) because Trey just had a match and 2) because
Bloodshed said he didn't need a long match because he is moving and doens't 
deserve to win, or have a good match none the less. and 3) because it molded
in well with the previous match.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 5: Crossbones Vr. Stryfe.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mike: Well these guys aren't in the arena tonight and their cell phones are off,
if anyone has any information on these people please contact me. 

OOC: Truth?  Well someone specifically was chosen by Crossbones to write this
match and I didn't get it and havne't seen Crossbones on line for a while, so
Crossbones won't, can't be mad that he doesn't get his match.

Mike: But this match SHOULD be on for Tuesday, god willing these guys show.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 6: Night Crawler Vr. Angel
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny: well our next match is between Night Crawler and Angel...this is a big
match, alot of controversy behind it.

Barry: Shut up, here comes Angel.

(((The lights flash really bright, then they go back to normal and Angel is in 
the ring, nothing more, nothing less.)))

Johnny: And here comes his opponent, Night Crawler:

(((The lights dim. The crowd looks towards the entranceway. They begin to boo 
knowing very well NightCrawler is about to come out. Red explosions shoot out 
from the entranceway and "NightCrawler" by Judas Priest begins to play. Dream 
walks out, and right behind her Night Crawler walks out. They make their way 
to the ring. )))

Angel attacks Night Crawler before the bell rings with a plancha over the top 
rope, that knocks Night Crawler backwards.  Angel with a few stiff shots to 
Night Crawler's jaw, that do nothing more than momentarily stun the big man.  
Night Crawler fires back with one good shot that knocks Angel back a few steps.  
Angel charges again and meets a hellacious clothesline from Night Crawler.  
Night Crawler pulls him to his feet and rams his head off of the guardrail.  
He then gives Angle a knee lift to the sternum and knocks him back down.  
Night Crawler picks up Angel and rolls him into the ring.  

Johnny: Nice...

Barry: What...nice ass?  you are sick man.

Johnny: I am really getting tired of you.

Night Crawler comes rolls in right behind Angle gets to his feet and stomps him 
into the mat.  Night Crawler pulls Angel up by his ears, and the irish whips him 
into the turnbuckle.  Night Crawler approaches to irish whip again but Angel 
repeatedly  kicks him in the knee.  Angel dropkicks Night Crawler in the knee and 
takes him  down to a kneeling position.  Angel quickly jumps to the second rope 
and dropkicks Night Crawler in the head knocking him onto his back.  Angle gets 
leverage  using the ropes and stands on the throat of Night Crawler.  Angel breaks 
the hold and backs off as Night Crawler gets to one knee Angel dropkicks it out 
and sends him back to the mat.  

Barry: decent move...Angel doens't get into singles matches much.

Angel again stand on his throat and this time doesent look like he will release him.  
Dream gets in the ring ang attacks Angle from behind, she rams her fingernails into his 
eye sockets.  Angel screams in pain and falls backwards onto the mat.  Dream helps 
Night Crawler to his feet and she gets back out of the ring.  Night Crawler drops 
a huge knee to the midsection of Angle and  then pulls him to his feet.  He chokeslams 
Angel hard to the mat, and nearly breaks his back.  He pulls him to his feet and 
chokeslams again.  He pulls Angle to his feet irish whips him and pulls off a 
devastating powerslam.  

Johnny: Night Crawler definately keeping up with Angel, and Angel not keeping up
with Night Crawler.

Night Crawler goes up top for some odd reason, and attempts a frog splash.  Angel 
rolls clear and Night Crawler bounces hard off of the mat.  Both men are trying to 
get up but neither has enough energy to do it on their first attempt.  They both 
get up on their second try and Night Crawler irish whips Angel to the corner.  
Angel slides under the ropes he grabs Night Crawler by the legs and pulls him 
groin first into the ringpost.  Dream comes running up from behind Angle again.  

Barry: I don't think Dream is too hot...

This time he sees her coming and drop toe holds her face first into the ringsteps.  
Dream looks to be knocked out cold.  Angel grabs a chair and rams into Night 
Crawlers knee crushing it against the ringpost.  He throws the chair to the ground 
and climbs back onto the apron. 
 
Johnny: Angel picking up the pace...

He jumps over the top rope and land with a leg drop accrossed Night Crawlers throat.  
Angel climbs up top and waits for Night Crawelr to get to his feet.  When he does 
Angel takes him right back down with a top rope spinning heel kick.  Angel attacks 
the knee yet again by applying a figure four.  Night Crawler escapes the hold by 
getting to the edge of the ring and rolling off of the apron.  Angel slides outside 
of the ring and kicks Night Crawelr in the head five or six times.  He then kicks 
him in the same knee he has been working on all match.  He gets him to his feet and 
pushes him onto the announce table Angle raps the camera wires around Night Crawlers 
neck and chokes him.  Angel finally takes the cord from his throat but lets him 
on the table.  He rolls into the ring and goes up top.  Angel FROM THE HEAVENS, 
destroys the table and his opponent.  Referee with the count 1..2.. he kicks out.  
Angel is stunned he's thrown his best at him and still cant get the pin.  Both 
appear to be out of gas at this point.  Angel rolls out of the wreckage, and gets 
back to his feet.  Seconds later Night Crawler rolls out of the mess.  

Barry: They are really keeping up with each other...I'll bet you'd like to be between
them Johnny...huh?  huh?

Johnny: No.

Angel attacks immediately but his punches dont effect Night Crawler.  Night Crawler with a 
shot to Angels jaw and knocks him down to the ground.  Angel gets up quickly but is 
shoved backwards into the ringpost.  Night Crawler charges him and clotheslines him 
to the ground.  He pulls up Angel by his hair and whips him into the guardrail next 
to the entrance ramp.  Angel falls to the ground Night Crawler follows him slowly.  
Night Crawler gets to the ringpost and Angel comes around the corner with chair shot 
that suprises Night Crawler but only slows him down.  Angel with a kick to the knee.  
Night Crawler just keeps coming at him Angle picks up the chair again and backs up 
the entrance ramp a couple feet.  He charges Night Crawler and knocks him down to 
the ground with a chairshot to the head.  Angel climbs into the ring.  Night Crawler 
gets to one knee and then back to his feet.  Angel attempts a springboard hurricanrana 
to teh outside but Night Crawler reverses it into THE NINE HELLS bouncing the head of 
Angel off of the steel entrance ramp.  The ref counts 1...2...3.  Night Crawler pushes
 Angel off of him and lays back.  Blood trickles out from behind Angels head.  Dream 
comes over to tend to Night Crawler.

Johnny: DAMN!  what a match!

Barry: we all know what you are REALLY thinking.

Johnny: How many times have you used that one tonight?  huh?

Barry: just shut up and go home.

And the winner is: Night Crawler
***************************************************************************

OOC: I want to say determining the winners of a match is a very very hard 
thing to do, alot of you do so well and are also against people who do so
well, it really is a hard thing for me to decide who wins, and if you give
me the chance, I normally will make up for you loosing if you have lost, but
wait it out, if you loose 4 times in a row I think you should talk to me, but
for real, this is really hard for me to do, I work my ass off writing these 
cards with no one elses help, so please don't overreact if you lost, we are
just here to have fun.

this goes for everyone, not just some people.

Cya,
Mike, Prez of OWF 2000
