Intro
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
(((The lights go out, Mike walks to the ring, the crowd goes wild as their
favorite president, Mike Wycklendt himself struts to the ring with the smile
on his face at what his federation has become.  He looks around the entire
arena to see row upon row of cheering fan, waiting for Mike to make his 
always-legendary announcement.  Mike, looks around and grabs the microphone,
brings it up to his mouth, opens his mouth as if  he is about to say 
something but then puts the microphone down and closes his mouth to get one
last awe at the entire arena.  They all cheer for him to begin the
announcement, Mike nods and finally, quickly raises the microphone to his
hand.)))

Mike: (Looks down at the Microphone, the crowd goes silent, Mike smiles) You
know, alot of people call this little contraption a Mike.  No no no, I am
"The Mike" not this little voice enhancer.  But did you all come here to 
hear me speak about the microphone?  (waits for reacation...silence...Mike
laughs a little)  Well come on...did you?  (The crowd doesn't know what to
say so they just scream...Mike laughs at their choice of words, if you even
want to call it that.)  Well of course you didn't.  Well this past week in
the OWF there has been QUITE a few new things happening, but none so 
important as our World Champion, whether I like it or not, (lowers his voice
and speaks very quickly) Shawn Matthews (gets back normal voice)

Well this guy, well he thinks that because he has the biggest peice of gold
in this federation he can do whatever.  Haha, they guy EVEN thinks he is 
more powerful than me.  He stated that: "I can't handle the job at president
of the oWf anymore"  If you think that is a shit comment I want to hear you
scream...just scream, and make it loud (The crowd goes absolutely nuts)  Ha,
well I guess you got your answer there Matthews.  Oh yeah, hey Anaheim, I 
got a big decision and the choice is ALL up to you really, I am putting this
into your hands.  You see, Matthews has said that he has renamed the World
title to Matthews blah blah blah blah blah, it's that Matthews part that 
gets me if you know what I mean.  Now if you would like to have the title
stay the WorldWW title and nothing more, especially with anything Matthews 
in it, scream louder than last time (Mike grabs onto the ropes mockingly 
because the response is so huge)  Whoa! I guess I know the answer to that 
one, thanks Anaheim, sorry Matthews.  And you know what...you think you can
not defend your title for A FRIGGING MONTH!  Come on, who do you think you 
are...who am I? (Mike grabs his ear) What's that...what's that I hear? Oh
yeah, I am the prez of this fed and I can make you defend it however and
whenever I please, so really, don't mess with me Matthews, you won't defend
it Tuesday, but you WILL FIGHT YOUR ASS OFF tonight and Tuesday in non-title
matches, why non title?  I don't know, because I feel people deserve chances
in life to get things right, unfortunately you just used your chance, so any
I guess that means next time you f-up...well, you are in deep shit with me
and this entire fed...because face it Matthews, no one likes you, plain and
simple.  Punto Final.

(((The Crowd cheers like crazy a Mike drops the microphone and walks out of
the arena, grinning...Mike has verbally defeated Matthews, well at least for
now.  He goes under the ropes to leave, but then all of a sudden New Model 
comes out to the ring to his usual entrance except with a very cocky demeanor 
about himself)))

New Model:(looking to where ever Mike is) Well "Pez", it looks like 
your little plan backfired. Not only did I beat the crap out of four other 
guys, but, I feel, I have earned....no, no, no, I DESERVE a one on one 
match with Marasmus for his .ORG title! You see, Marasmus, you accused 
me of something untrue, and that my freind, IS WRONG! Not only did you 
insult my promos, which by the way, already hold records for ratings,

Barry: Ha!  What a bunch of crap. 

but you insult my wrestling ability. Marasmus, I can understand how you 
would put down my techniques, I mean, this federation has put out more 
crap and less wrestling, than WWF in April of 2000, and that's hard to 
top!Personally, I don't care if you're already defending another title, 
if you were any kind of a champion, you'd be able to do that, get your 
ass beat by me, and make it home in time to have Lizzy set out your 
Pooh Bear jammies. Now, Mar, I feel that not only have I earned the right 
to talk however I see fit, but I have also earned the right to win your 
.ORG title, right here, TONIGHT!! And incase anyone needs to be 
reminded why, I've preparred a little video to refreach your memories. roll 
the tape.

(( New Model's music starts and a video appears on the entrance screen 
showing over, and over, and over The New Model pinning Marasmus from 
different angles at TNT. During the video, Marasmus' music and video 
interject and the .ORG champion comes out.))

MaRaSmUs: model....so you have a victory over me--not a thing to brag about! 
you have beat me, but it wasnt one-on-one! when you beat me one-on-one, then
you can play the footage all you want. so, tonight....you can get that shot. 
me you, in a .Org match. harcore, or whatever you wanna call it. Hardcore is 
my favorite. even though deathmatches are better, a hardcore one will do.  
Model, you arent as bad as I originally though. I did what I hate, and I
underestimated you. I just hope that I dont OVER estimate you, but i doubt that. 
so tonight, you and me, hardcore, me vs. you. im gonna make you bleed.

(((New Model and Marasmus exit from opposite sides of the arena.  Leaving
Mike the only one, standing in the middle, looking both ways to where the
past two wrestlers just left.  He shrugs his shoulders and picks back up the
microphone.)))

Mike: Did anyone else notice how I had absolutely nothing to do with that?  I
mean come on...this is my federation...is it not?  Well you know, Matthews is
the man on my mind right now...so you

Scotty Hinton Interview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sid Phillips is standing inside of Scotty Hinton's locker 
room looking for an interview with him.  Hinton is standing beside him 
and Phillips begins.*

Sid Phillips:  Mr. Hinton, you no doubt know by now that you and 
Stewart Hix are set to fight this coming Tuesday in Anaheim?  Any comments on 
this newbie here in the OWF?

*Hinton looks into the camera and the boos are heard reverberating 
throughout the arena.  He gives it his trademark grin and starts his 
diatribe.*

Hinton:  Do I have any comments for Stewy Hix?  Why yes, yes I do.  
Stewart Hix wants to come into my federation and act like he's top dog 
when he's nothing but a little puppy here in the OWF.  Stewart Hix wants 
to drop vaguely homosexual references about "lighting up your ass" and 
"smoking" it.  Stewart Hix wants to proclaim himself as the ultimate 
heel.  Sorry, taken.  Stewart Hix wants to come in and proclaim to be a 
game and a franchise.  Stewart Hix is the perverbial thorn in the 
Impecable One's paw.  Do you think that you impress anyone or scare anyone 
with your claims of being insane?  Do you think that you impress or scare 
anyone with your constant pot-smoking?  You do nothing but sicken and 
disgut The Impecable One.  But when this Tuesday comes and our match 
ensues, you will realize what you've gotten into.  You will realize that 
you are in the ring with The Impecable One, a perfect specimen of 
everything wrestling embodies.  And when you are down on your back counting 
the lights in your dazed state and saying, "Please, Mr. Hinton.  No 
more!  You've won.  You are better than I!', I will look down on you and 
laugh in your face as I slap on the most painful and awe-inspiring move 
in the world of wrestling...yes, I'm talking about The Canadian Maple 
Leaf.  So smoke all the pot you need to to get into a state of mind where 
you'll feel no pain, because I assure you that when I slap the move on, 
you'll need all the pain killer in the world to keep from tapping out 
like the little bitch that you are.  Now smoke THAT, chuckles.

*Hinton throws one of his t-shirts over the face of Phillips and walks 
off.*

when she stops, MaRaSmUs comes out in perfect tune with the music. they make

it away to a fan at every entrance. he gives out high fives and such. then he 
gets to the ring and dances. he goes to the turnbuckle and puts his hands in 
the air to make a M and a A, to stand for Mac Attack. The place goes dark and 
the crowd starts to buzz.))) 

(((Smoke fills the entrance way. The beginning of "The House of the Rising Sun" 
starts but is scratched off and "Fight Fire with Fire" starts pumping over the 
speakers. Mr. Tokyo's entrance video plays over the Jumbotron. Mr. Tokyo walks 
through the smoke and to the ring with a deadly serious look on his face.))) 

He waists no time rolling into the ring. He takes a vial from his tights and

Ding Ding Ding! Mac Daddy and Mr. Tokyo start out by punching one another. Mac 
Daddy falls to the ground. Mr. Tokyo gets him up and gives him a big bulldog.

Match 4: Lowell DotCom Vr. Chris Naveed Vr. Purple Haze and Jekel - Tag Champ
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Johnny: Whoa!  That was a pretty bad verbal lashing on Mike's part towards
Matthews.

Barry: Yeah, and I heard this wild rumor, well considering what it is about
it isn't that wild.

Johnny: Oh really?  What would that be?

Barry: That you are a gay and have "feelings" for Matthews.

Johnny: oh yes...those.

Barry: Aha!  It is true!

Johnny: It's called sarcasm.  Learn it.

Barry: It's called I whooped your ass in a hell in a cell, stay away.

Johnny: You know I thought that maybe since we had off on Tuesday you could
cool down and realize your verbal "lashings" aren't worth much.

Barry: Ah that's where you are totally wrong my friend, that means I have 
double these "lashings" for you tonight, I have all this unused material 
that I worked hard on and won't let go to waste.

Johnny: Only you could work for hours on jokes that revolve around "u're 
gay" 

Barry: Just shut up, here comes our first tag team.

((( The lights in the arena go out, leaving the fans wondering what's coming next. 
Out of nowhere, "Hello Time Bomb" begins to blast over the speakers at the same
time there's 4 huge blue colored explosions on the stage where Lowell makes his 
enterence. Lowell walks down to the ring, he stands in the middle and throws his 
fist up in the air which is followed by blue flames coming up from each of the 
four turnbuckles.  Then right after Chris Naveed runs out, apparently still 
putting on his wrestling clothes, and Lowell Rolls his eyes as Naveed gives him
a hopeless 2 thumbs up.)))

Johnny: Op, and here comes the defending champions, Purple Haze and Jekel!

((( The Arena goes black, all of the sudden there is an explosion where the 
wrestlers enter from. A single beam of purple light focuses on the entryway 
and Purple Hazeblares over the PA system, Purple Hayes walks out, and a multitude 
of psychadelic colors flash over the crowd, he looks around, then runs full bore 
to the ring, slides under the ropes, runs over to the corners (all four of them, 
in turn) and jumps up to the second turnbuckle and raises his arms out to the 
side with his hands open. (at each corner) Jekel then comes out behind him
running to catch up, Purple Haze looks angry. )))

Barry: I heard you have feelings for them too.

Johnny: Just shut it ok?

Barry: Oh, you're gonna get it bad one day man, real bad.

Lowell DotCom and Purple Haze start out in the ring.  Lowell Charges Haze
with a spear and gets Haze all the way to the corner turnbuckle.  Lowell 
backs up and does  running clothesline right into Haze.  He backs up and 
tries for it agai but Haze falls over from the previous hit and Lowell runs
hard into the turnbuckle.  Lowell falls backwards and Haze gets up, he walks
over to Jekel who seems to be looking out at the crowd.  Haze sticks his 
hand out again but doesn't get Jekel's attention.  Haze finally grabs Jekel
by the shoulders and flips him in the ring backwards and goes out himself. 
By this time Lowell has made it to his feet.  Jekel runs in and goes for a 
headlock but Lowell easily gets out of it and puts Jekel in an arm wrench
and throws him to the ground.  Lowell looks down at him and rolls his eyes.

Barry: Wow, as a superstar pro wrestler myself I know that if I were Haze I 
would be PISSED OFF!

Lowell goes to the side and tags an eager Chris Naveed and he runs into the
ring.  Jekel slowly gets up and is greeted with a fast clothesline by Naveed
and Jekel falls down again.  Naveed turns around to Lowell and gives him a 
good two thumbs up.  Lowell grabs his forehead in embarrassment.  Naveed is
still doing the two thumbs up when Lowell raises his head again, Lowell 
rolls his eyes and sees Jekel getting up and approaching Naveed.  Lowell 
screams to turn around and Naveed turns around and hits Jekel with a round
house kick to the cheek.  Lowell claps his hands and Naveed does a the Molly
Shannon Superstar sign and Lowell screams "no!" and runs into the ring angry
and tags Naveed's hand.  Haze does the same thing to Jekel, except Haze is
obviously VERY angry.  Haze and Lowell lock up and Haze does a suplex on
Lowell but Lowell gets back up with minor pain.  Lowell dives at Haze with
a spinning DDT and lands it.  

Johnny: Nice move.

Barry: What did you say!?!

Johnny: Nice move.

Barry: No no no, I distinctly heard you say "nice body"

Johnny: Oh god, just shut up.

Barry: I don't know man, you really make me worry.

Lowell gets up and Haze is still on the ground.  All of a sudden The New 
Model runs in and goes right at Lowell DotCom and goes for a few punches
while the ref is examining the damage of the DDT on Haze.  Lowell and New 
Model exchange punches and Lowell finally gets New Model into a head lock
and taps the ref on the back gently with his foot, the ref turns around to
see New Model and immidiately throws him out of the ring.

Barry: haha, someones screwed!

Lowell goes to the top rope and does a frog splash squarely on Purple Haze,
during this, Haze is screaming for Jekel, who isn't paying attention at all
to the match.  Haze looked really pissed, but then it was all gone when
Lowell landed the splash and Haze went out of it: 1......2........3 and 
Lowell Dotcom and Chris Naveed are our new Tag Team Champions!

Barry: Cheating ain't right...Mike, come on, when you gonna fire these cue
guys, look at some of this desperate content they want me to say.

Johnny: Yeah I know, I wouldn't say anything here I wouldn't say in real 
life.

Barry: Did anyone ask you?  No... so just shut up unless spoken to.

And the Winners are: Lowell DotCom and Chris Naveed

Match 5: Crossbones Vr. Stryfe- Hell in a Cell
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Promo: A career. The very lifeblood of a man's life. A soul. The very essence of 
that same man. Tonight ... in one fatal matchup, both will be on the line. 
In a match that has spent a lifetime in the making, a father and son will 
step into the hellacious confines of the hell in a cell. Will the cell 
settle the matter these two have formed ... or will it merely bring about 
more questions? All answers will be given ... tonight ... in the Hell ... in 
a cell!

As the intro had stated, this match really was a lifetime in the making. In 
the past ... a father has loved his son ... and likewise for the son to love 
the father. In the twisted world of professional wrestling the laws had been 
changed. Now, a father and son would step into a steel construct custom 
built for injury. The prize? If Stryfe walks away victorious, Crossbones 
will never step into an OWF 2000 ring again. If Crossbones can come out the 
victor, his brother will be set free from the eternal hell he has had to 
endure under the control of his father. On a much smaller scale, he would 
also be crowned .Com champion. Everything since Crossbones' arrival has 
built to this moment ... where everything will be on the line. Hanging from 
the rafters of the arena was the cell, the steel gleaming in the light. 
Suddenly ... an explosion! Walking from the back, a demonic cape draped over 
his back, was the evil Stryfe. At his side was his other son, Skull, whom 
was under the control of the man who was his father. Drool dripped from his 
lips, a distant look in his gleaming eyes. Stryfe was smiling, obviously 
feeling the energy that was filling the arena. Much would happen this 
night ... and it would truely change history. Stepping into the ring, Stryfe 
jumped to the top turnbuckle, staring out at the people. An evil smile 
stretched across his face, as he tossed his cape to the mat. He shouted an 
order to Skull, who immediatly obeyed, stepping from the ring. Stryfe looked 
around, as his music faded away. Then, another explosion. As soon as the 
flames shot into the air, the lights disappeared, as haunting music filled 
the arena. 

The music, though haunting, was drowned out by the cheers of the 
crowd, as Crossbones walked from the back. He was also wearing strange 
attire, demonic shoulder pads attached. On his face, black paint was 
smeared in an evil design, his white eyes beaming out from the black. His hair 
was still wet, hanging down on his back, still marked by the burns from the 
Inferno Match. The fans responded to the look, obviously noticing the darker 
side of the new fan favorite. Walking past his brother, he spared only a 
quick glance, sliding into the ring. Stryfe smiled as they locked eyes, 
coming nose to nose. Suddenly, the were split by the music of the 
special guest referee. Both looked on as the Heart Break Kid, a legend in the 
ahlls of the OWF, walked to the ring, a promotional T-Shirt over his torso. 
As he walked to the ring, the cell began to lower. The moment was at hand. It 
was do or die ... for a man's soul!

As the Heartbreak Kid slid into the ring, the cell finally touched the 
floor. Chains made of pure steel wrapped around the door, making sure there 
would be no escape. Crossbones and Stryfe stared at each other, both begging 
the other to make the first move. And then ... Stryfe attacked. Slamming a 
fist into the cheek of Crossbones, Crossbones responded, a series of punches 
being exchanged. Finally, Stryfe overcame the odds, and began to pound 
Crossbones. Crossbones dropped to one knee, as a flurry of punches 
struck his skull, leaving him dazed. Stryfe quickly sent a kick to Crossbones' 
jaw, dropping him completely to the mat. Outside the cell, Skull pounded on 
the door, wishing to be let in. A constant howl emitted from his throat, as 
Crossbones recieved repeated kicks to the gut. Stryfe stared down at the 
winded man who was his son, a smile spreading over his lips. With a final 
kick, he rolled Crossbones out of the ring, letting him fall to the ringmats 
outside. As Stryfe stepped out of the ring, he sent a glare the way of 
HBK, as if to warn him to stay away. Whatever Stryfe had planned, would not 
be a pretty sight. As Stryfe jumped to the floor however, Crossbones sent a 
fist to his mid regions, shocking Stryfe. Crossbones jumped to his feet, a 
forearm hitting the back of Stryfe's skull, knocking him down, the top of 
his head grazing the steel mesh. Crossbones then continued to massacre, 
jamming  Stryfe's face into the mesh, grinding the steel in his flesh. 
Screams emitted from deep in his throat, causing Crossbones to drop 
him, walking around to the other side of the ring. He looked around, as if 
he was lost, before finally finding his target. In one swift movement, he 
picked up the steel ringsteps, holding them high in the air. A he walked back 
around to Stryfe, he was on his feet, holding his gut. Ssuddenly, Crossbones 
reared back, tossing the steps at his father. The steps smashed into Stryfe's 
forehead, knocking him hard to the mat. Inside the ring, HBK stared in 
disbelief, as Crossbones walked over to the scene. 

Tossing the steps aside, he picked Stryfe off the mat, smashing his head into 
the side of the cell. Blood was now drenching the face of Crossbones' father, 
who was barely conscious. Crossbones looked around the ring, viewing the carnage. 
If he wished to end the match, he could have pinned Stryfe then. But he 
wasn't done yet. After a few more quick kicks, Crossbones slid back into the 
ring, diving to the top. Suddenly, he was performing a moonsault. But what he 
had failed to notice was that Stryfe had climbed to his feet. In the heat of the 
move, Stryfe tossed the steps into his body, causing him to crash down on 
top of them. A dull scream rose from his mouth, as he rolled over. He had 
landed hard on the sharp edges of the steps, a huge gash appearing on his 
left side. His hand shot to the wound, as a weakened Stryfe picked him off 
the ring mats, tossing him back into the ring. Stryfe rolled back in, 
throwing an arm over Ccrossbones. The count reached two, but Crossbones 
threw a shoulder up. Stryfe cursed to himself, pulling Crossbones up, 
twisting him into a reverse chin lock. HBK was in position, constantly 
asking Crossbones if he wished to submit. Finally, Crossbones wrapped his 
legs around those of Stryfe's, twisting free of the hold. In a manuver 
that left him defenseless, he stomped the crotch of his father, before 
falling back to the mat. Shawn didn't count them down, instead letting them 
both regain their composure. Crossbones was the first up, falling against 
the ropes for support. Obviously falling to hard, he rolled over the ropes, 
falling to the outside. His tights were bathed in blood that ran from 
his side and back, both cut open by the steel steps. Finally regaining 
himself, he tossed the ring apron up, and crawled under the ring, disappearing 
into the darkness. When he returned, he held a ladder in his arms. The crowd 
exploded when they saw it, cheering. The cheers seemed to revive Stryfe, who 
began to climb to his feet. With his remaining strength, Crossbones tossed 
the ladder into the ring, nearly nailing the Heart Break Kid. Sliding 
in, Crossbones started to pull Stryfe up. When Stryfe was on his knees, he 
sent a low blow to Crossbones, who keeled over on impact. Stryfe responded 
by performing a face crusher, smashing the face of Crossbones into the 
steel ladder. The fans groaned at the sight, as Stryfe climbed to his feet, 
blood running down his face. In one motion, Stryfe picked up the ladder, 
setting it up. The ladder was bigger than previously thought, the top nearly 
touching the roof of the cell. Stryfe picked Crossbones off of the mat, 
putting one of his legs through the rung on the ladder, tying his legs 
together. Crossbones was still motionless ... unmoving. Diving to the 
outside, Stryfe pulled a steel chair from under the ring, leaping back 
in, an obvious spring in his step. In a quick motion, he slammed the chair 
into the right knee of his son, suddenly jolting him back to awareness. 
Stryfe performed the action twice more, before finally untying the legs of 
Crossbones. Crossbones held his knee, a look of strain crossing his 
face everytime he touched it. Surprisingly, the ladder still stood. Stryfe 
looked up, staring to the top. A smile suddenly crossed his face. Climbing to 
the top, Stryfe reached for the roof, grabbing some of the steel mesh in 
his palm. With amazing strength, he peeled back a section of the roof, 
leaving a gaping hole. 

Grabbing onto a sturdy support beam, he pulled himself off of the ladder, 
and onto the roof of the cell. In the ring, Crossbones was 
limping toward the ladder, looking up at his father. Enduring the pain, 
he climbed the ladder, Stryfe standing at the top, taunting him. When he 
reached the top step, Stryfe kicked the ladder, sending Crossbones 
sprawling to the support beam across from Stryfe. Stryfe simply crossed over, and 
looked down at Ccrossbones. With a single boot, he crushed Crossbones' hand, 
sending him falling back to the ring. Instead of landing on the ring mats 
however, Crossbones landed on the fallen ladder, a thundering sound of flesh 
on steel heard. It was sickening. On the roof of the cell, Stryfe began to 
cackle, staring down at Skull. Skull walked up to the door, ripping the door 
from it's hinges! The chains snapped in half, as the unstoppable 
machine walked into the cell. HBK stood at ringside, staring at the scene of 
destruction in the ring. Skull jumped into the ring, staring at his 
fallen brother. HBK dove into the ring, standing in front of Skull, their 
noses planted in each other's. Suddenly, Skull wrapped his hand around 
Shawn's throat, hoisting him into the air. Dropping him onto the ladder, Skull 
continued to stare at his brother. On the outside, Stryfe had climbed 
down the side of the cage, and was now standing in the doorway. Walking into 
the ring, he placed an arm over his son for the pin, waiting for the count. 
But HBK was unconscious. Suddenly, another referee ran down from the back, 
sliding in. As he counted, he was about to reach three before he was 
jerked out of position. HBK had recovered, pulling the ref away. The referee 
turned to Shawn, but was greeted with a super kick to his jaw, knocking him 
out of the ring. HBK dropped to the mat, and began to count. But then ... 
Crossbones kicked out. The entire crowd was in shock. Crossbones had kicked 
out. Stryfe cursed aloud, shoving Skull out of his way. Reaching down, 
he found the steel chair he had used earlier, picking it up off of the 
mat. As he prepared to swing it, Crossbones did a quick front leg trip, causing 
Stryfe to fall into the chair, knocking himself out. The entire ring was a 
warzone, weapons laying all over. Skull suddenly walked forward, ready 
to attack. Crossbones turned right into him, Skull's hand wrapping around 
Crossbones' throat. Crossbones unleashed a knee to Skull's gut, 
continuing with a knee to his face. Crossbones was now on the advantage, and he 
planned to remain in that spot. Grabbing the steel chair, he walked out of the 
cell, tossing the chair to the top. Then ... he ascended to the top, pain 
evident in every stride.  Inside, HBK looked around in confusion, as Stryfe 
climbed up to his feet, bleeding heavily. He stummbled toward the ropes, using 
them for support. He looked around for Crossbones, finally spotting him 
laying  on the roof of the cell. Stryfe rolled out of the ring, and stumbled 
out of the cell door. He hooked his fingers on the rungs, and began to climb 
up, following Crossbones. Skull was stil unconscious, was in the ring, 
barely moving. When both men reached the top, Crossbones threw a fist, sending 
Stryfe to the very edge, barely staying on solid ground. Crossbones walked 
over, surveying the situation. Sending a well placed kick to the nose, 
he caused Stryfe to fall on his face, the sharp edges of the cage burying 
themselves into flesh. Suddenly, Crossbones jumped into the air, letting his 
leg crash down onto his father, loosening the segment of roof they stood on.

 
Suddenly, the crowd exploded in cheers. On the side of the cage, HBK was 
climbing up the side, a grim look on his face. On top of the cage, 
Crossbones was holding the steel chair, measuring up Stryfe. He tapped 
his head once, to assure himself of it's location. Then, in one solid 
movement, he cracked the chair over his skull, a crack sounding throughout the 
arena. When HBK reached the top, Crossbones was holding Stryfe in a headlock 
of sorts. Suddenly, Stryfe hoisted Crossbones up, breaking free of the 
hold. Holding him in mid-air, Stryfe propelled him forward, sending him 
crashing through the cage roof! The roof broke, a small section caving in, 
hanging on by only a few hinges. Stryfe laughed, as he walked over to the hole. 
But to his shock, Crossbones was standing in the center of the ring, staring 
up at his father. A look of horror came over his face, as Crossbones dove to 
the top turnbuckle, and stood, staring at the hanging segment. Suddenly, he 
jumped forward, latching onto the section. With rapid speed, he climbed 
up, only one rung left to ascend. Suddenly, Stryfe appeared at the mouth of 
the pit, stomping on one of Crossbones' fingers. Crossbones flinched but 
did not fall. As Stryfe prepared to repeat the action, Crossbones shot one arm 
up, tripping Stryfe. Stryfe fell backward, smacking his head on the steel 
chair that lay behind him. Down in the ring, Skull had finally gotten to his 
feet. He looked around, finding the brawl. Suddenly, his eyes went blank, and 
his body seemed to take robotic action, as he leaped out of the ring, 
walking around to the timekeepers table. Reaching back, he suddenly pulled out 
a large briefcase, swinging it onto his shoulder. He slowly began to 
climb to the top of the cage, as Crossbones was finally settled back on the 
roof. The fans were on the edge of their seats, wondering what would happen next. 
As Crossbones sent a few well placed kicks, Skull reached the top, opening 
the large case. Suddenly, his hand emerged, a thin line of barbed wire in 
his palm! Walking across the roof of the cell, he approached Crossbones, 
attempting to sneak up on him. Suddenly, he pulled the barbed wire 
across Crossbones throat, tightening it. Crossbones screamed as the sharp wire 
burrowed into his throat, drawing blood. A maniacle smile crossed over 
Skull's face, as he tightened his pull, never giving up. As he 
continued, Stryfe finally reached his feet, obviously dazed. When he spotted his 
two sons, he began to smile, walking over to them. He shouted something to 
Skull, which caused him to release the hold and walk over to the 
briefcase again. When it finally reached him, Stryfe reached inside, and removed 
another object. Two to be precise. A hammer and nail. Then he reached 
back inside, digging around for a moment. When his hand emerged, he was 
holding an authentic OWF 2000 microphone.

Stryfe: Crossbones ... I knew it would happen. From the moment of your 
birth, I knew we would fight this day. The leaders called you a king 
... they told me that you would be the man to bring our bloodline to glory. 
But son ... I knew what was to really happen! You were weak ... and needed 
a strong replacement. And that replacement ... was me! If I was to fufill 
prophecy, I needed to rid myself of you. It became an obsession to rid 
the world of your evil, and that quest has led me to this night ... to this 
very moment! Crossbones, you were to be a savior ... it's about time I 
treated you like one!

Suddenly, his intentions were all to clear. With hammer and nails in hand, 
he stummbled over to his son, and spread his arms. Putting his hand 
palm up, he placed the nail point down, and raised the hammer. Suddenly, HBK 
intervened, kicking the nails down to the mat. Skull reacted instinctivly, 
wrapping his hand around Shawn Michael's throat. As he prepared to chokeslam 
him, Stryfe stopped him, pointing to the edge of the cage. Skull got the 
message, dragging Shawn to the edge. With all his strength, he hoisted Shawn 
into the air, and released. The plan had been to slam him off of the cage 
... but nothing goes according to plan. While in mid-air, Shawn wrapped his 
legs around Skull's head, and performed a perfect hurrincurana, both men 
plummeting to the arena floor. On impact, Shawn shattered an announce 
booth, while Skull landed hard on cement. On top of the cage, Stryfe still hel 
his hammer, a look of confusion now on his face. Finally, he turned back to 
Crossbones, lifting the hammer. With or without nails, he would finish 
off his son. Bbut suddenly, Crossbones shot up a fist, knocking Stryfe 
away. The fans shot to attention, as he reached for Stryfe's hammer, wrapping his 
finger around the handle. As Stryfe regained his composure, Crossbones 
sent the hammer into Stryfe's kneecap, sending him falling. As his head hit 
the mesh, Crossbones reached into his tights, reaching for something. When 
he pulled his hand into the open, the crowd went insane. In his palm was a 
book of matches, and Crossbones had evil intentions. Striking off a single 
match, he held it over Stryfe's body, taunting the screaming fans. Finally, he 
dropped it, letting the fire spread over the screaming Stryfe. As the fire 
consumed his shirt, moving to his tights, Stryfe shot to his feet, 
beating his hands against the flames. Suddenly, a section of the roof gave way, 
a flaming body falling toward the ring. As he fell, however, the flames 
disappated, returning to normal as he crashed toward the ring. When he 
hit, Crossbones looked around, obviously wondering what to do next. The 
answer came suddenly, as he moved to the edge of the pit, looking down at his 
father. Suddenly, he jumped, performing a perfect Sternum Splash! As he 
crashed into Stryfe's body, the ring gave way, caving in, both bodies 
touching the arena floor. All around ... there was chaos. HBK and Skull 
lay in heaps outside the cell, both unconscious. On the inside, Stryfe lay 
under Crossbones, both of them unconscious as well. Suddenly, a scream arose 
from the crowd. Running from the back, a referee shirt in hand, was the OWF 
2000 president, known only as Mike. Ppulling the shirt on as he ran, he 
passed through the hole in the cage, sliding into the ring, now destroyed. 
Raising his arm, he slapped the mat once. Then again. Then, finally, he counted 
the three. The match was over. Crossbones was once again the OWF 2000 .Com 
champion. His brother was now free. Suddenly, men rushed from the back, 
four stretchers being pushed. On the outside, Skull was helped onto one of 
them, as well as the Heart Break Kid. Inside, however, only Stryfe was 
helped. Crossbones was standing. His eyes were filled with tears, as the belt 
was handed to him. He raised his arms, as Mmike walked to the back, his job 
finished. Suddenly, Crossbones looked out to his brother, motioning 
with his hand. To the shock of the crowd, Skull shot to a sitting position, his 
head swinging over to his brother. Throwing the straps from his body, he 
limped toward the cage, walking through the door he had ripped from the 
hindges. As he slid into the ring, he walked up to Crossbones, staring him straight 
in the eye. Suddenly, a smile crossed over the face of Crossbones, as he 
wrapped his arms around his brother, who responded, hugging him back. The 
fans were all standing, an applause breaking out among them. When they 
broke, Skull raised the arm of his brother, who held his belt in the 
other. Stryfe was finally loaded onto a stretcher, as he was rolled from the 
arena. It was over. It was finally over.

Match 6: Crag Vr. Jack Gambino - Backlot Brawl
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Johnny: Well our next match won't be here, inside the arena...so let's turn on 
that tron!

Barry: Gay man...real gay.	Well yeah, this one is in a shady backlot of an 
arena...ohhhhh, I'm scared...please.

Johnny: That isn't the purpose--

Barry: Do I care what the purpose is???  Wait...I hear they just started.

Crag and Jack Gambino are seen outside, Crag throws Jack Gambino into the 
windsheild of a car and it cracks a little.  Jack Gambino rolls out as Crag 
dives on the car.  Crag stands up and jumps off the car and goes into a headlock
with Jack Gambino.  Crag knees him in the stomach and then does a DDT right on 
the cement.  Jack Gambino screams in pain as blood starts to gush from his head.
Crag sees a beer bottle and slams it against the wall and throws the sharp 
remains at Jack Gambino.  It cuts Jack Gambino's arm and he grabs it in pain.

Barry: WOW!  This match has been on for seconds and there is tons of bleeding 
already...who doesn't like it.

Jack Gambino charges Crag and does a clothesline, Crag falls back and slams his
head into the cement, but not as hard as the DDT he did to Jack Gambino.  Crag
shakes his head and gets up.  Crag gets up and whips Jack Gambino into the wall.
Soon after he charges him and grabs his head and slams it into the wall several
times.  When Crag lets go he looks at his hands and they are all read in blood.

Johnny: Oh my god...this is getting sick...

Barry: Come on...how gay: "This is getting sick"  geez.  

Crag shrugs and gives Jack Gambino the elbow to the chin.  Jack Gambino spits out
the tip of his tounge and the entire arena makes some sort of discusted noise.
Jack Gambino goes to a car and tries to do a flying clothesline on Crag, but
Crag sidesteps and throws Jack Gambino's head right into the ground.  Crag
decides He has had enough and goes for the pin: 1........2.....and Jack Gambino
kicks out.

Barry: WHAT IS HE DOING!?!

Johnny: I need to say, that wasn't the smartest thing.

Gambino spits a mouthfull of blood right into Crags eyes and Crag grabs his 
eyes and tries to wipe the blood out.  Gambino gets up and Crag, with his
eyes closed shoves him off and does a drop kick, Crag lands on his elbow
and Gambino falls to the ground.  Crag breaks the window of the car and brings
a peice of glass over to Gambino.  He then makes a cut in Gambino's thighs, 
through his tights you can see he carved 50 for the 50 states of the US.  He 
then kicks the cut and goes for the pin: 1......2..........3 and that's it.

And the Winner is: Crag

Match 7: Marasmus Vr. New Model Vr. Shawn Matthews
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Johnny: Well I wonder what Marasmus and New Model are thinking.

Barry: yeah, but we all know what YOU are thinking.

Johnny: Whatever.  Well here comes New Model

(((An explosion erupts on both sides of the entrance area. The New Model then walks out very casualy. He 
glances around the arena, usually points out an individual and laughs at them. Then he continues his stroll to the 
ring. When he gets there, he motions for the crowd to give him more of a pop. When they don't, he gestures 
for them to go home because he doesn't need them anyway)))
Barry: Yeah, there ya have it...but anyways, here come Matthews...our world
champion...aren't we proud...

(((: The arena goes black. Then on the screen above the entrance the word WARNING flashes in red. 
Firworks shoot straight up on each side of the entrance & Danger Zone starts to play. As the lights come on Shawn 
is standing looking straight at the entrance. He walks down the to the ring looking around the arena. He slides 
underneath the ropes & spreads his arms wide open & turns 360 degrees around looking at the whole entire 
arena. )))

Johnny: Geez, with a man like that as our World champion it really makes me
question why I work for this corperation.

Barry: I thought I was that man...

Johnny: Yeah, you are, Matthews just adds to it.

Barry: Good.  Well here comes the defending .ORG champ...Marasmus.  

(((the lights go out and then an eerie red light fills the ring and enterance way. the music plays and red mist
 fills up by the curtains leading from the backstage to the arena. a womanly figure step throught the mist and
 stops. when she stops, MaRaSmUs comes out in perfect tune with the music. they make their way to the ring, 
and MaRaSmUs goes between the ropes as lizzy uses the steps. MaRaSmUs then lifts the bottom rope for
 lizzy and she bends all the way over and under, much to the delight of the male audience.  )))
Johnny: So...no one really said...would that mean this match is hardcore?

Barry: Yep...Matthews in a hardcore anything goes match, I can't wait...he's
gonna get screwed ova!

The three men each take a corner, stare each other off and New Model is the
first one to strike, he runs at Marasmus and they lock up, but Matthews 
comes up from behind and breaks it up and ties up with Marasmus himself.  
New Model stumbles a few steps, looks up at Matthews, who is still tied up
with Marasmus and looks pissed, he runs right at Matthews and throws his 
entire momentum into a clothesline and Matthews and Marasmus fall to the 
ground.  New Model starts kicking Matthews in the chest and Marasmus slips
out of the ring hoping no one will notice.  He looks to Lizzy and she points
under the ring, Marasmus looks under the ring and pulls out a ladder.  

Johnny: Marasmus with a ladder, always legendary.

Barry: Shut the crap, 10 to 1 he doesn't do anything cool with it.

Johnny: I don't know--

Barry: hey, don't argue with me, I don't argue with you.

Johnny: Yeah, but you do every other kind of verbal abuse.

Barry: Yeah, and lets keep it that way...don't be girly AND gay.

Marasmus climbs into the ring, New Model charges him ad Marasmus throws the
ladder right at him, knocking him down.  Marasmus picks up the ladder and
Matthews gets up as New Model slides out of the ring.  Marasmus grabs the 
ladder and swings it around, knocking Marasmus to the ground.  Marasmus goes
over to the side New Model slid out of, but he isn't there, then all of a 
sudden the crowd starts to scream and Marasmus turns around, New Model hits
Marasmus in the head with a chair!  Marasmus hits the ground and New Model
grabs the ladder and throws it to the turn buckle.  He then goes over to 
Matthews and pulls him up, he throws Matthews into the ladder in the turn
buckle, Matthews grabs his back in pain.

Barry: Ha!  That's what happens when you take a pretty boy technical 
wrestler and put him in an anything goes match.

Matthews falls to the ground and Lizzy is trying to put a table into the
ring for Marasmus.  Marasmus sees this and slowly gets up and walks over and
pulls it in, while New Model is in the corner punching Matthews.  Marasmus
sets it up and grabs a bat from Lizzy.  Marasmus creeps up behind New Model
and hits him in the back of the head with a bat.  New Model hits the ground
and Marasmus tries the same thing with Matthews but Matthews ducks it and 
grabs it, and hits Marasmus in the side with it, Marasmus goes to the mat.
Matthews walks over to New Model, hits him in the chest with it a few times
and puts him on the table.  Matthews goes to the top ropes and Marasmus 
starts getting up.

Barry: Ah, there is no way Marasmus will have time to stop him.

Johnny: Well I don't know-

Barry: No, there is no possible way.

Marasmus walks over and grabs the side of the table, Matthews attempts a 
backflip, but Marasmus tips over the table and Matthews falls hard on his
back.  Marasmus goes over and grabs the-now-torn-up ladder and hits Matthews
with it a few times.  He goes for the cover: 1........2.........3 and 
Matthews is out of it.  New Model is still lying on the ground, Lizzy calls
Marasmus over and he walks over.  Lizzy throws in the belt and Marasmus 
blows her a kiss.  He walks over and sets in on New Model's face.  He then
steps on it, crushing New Model's nose.

Johnny: Well we'll see if he still is a Model after this match...

Barry: Lame Johnny...very lame.

Marasmus grabs the table and sets it up.  He puts New Model on top and sets
the ladder back up.  Marasmus climbs to the top, he looks to the crowd,
hundreds of cameras flash and the arena is lit up.  He tries to keep his 
balance and finally jumps off the top and lands an elbow right on New Model.
New Model doesn't even leave the table and Marasmus goes for the pin inside
the broken table 1........2............3 and Marasmus is still the .ORG 
champion!

(((all of a sudden Mike walks out to the ring.)))

Mike: You see Marasmus, you and me...we have really never had anything against
each other...right...but you know, you can't hold all my titles, and technically
you didn't even win.

Marasmus: What???

Mike: You see, New Model's back never even touched the mat, so you didn't get
the pin, and I think I will have to give New Model this.

(((Mike throws New Model a baseball bat and New Model hits Marasmus over the
head, Mike goes and rings the bell.  New Model goes for the pin: 1..........2
.........3 and New Model is the new .ORG champion)))

And the winner is: New Model, the new .ORG champion.
*********************************************************************************

Survivor Note: I realized that if I were to have survivor today then Tuesday would
be too soon to vote someone out, so this match will be on Tuesday to keep
everything the way it is supposed to be (aka match on Tuesday vote out on Saturday)
Sorry this has been post poned so long, but things just were...weird last week.
and besides, I think I still put out a hell of a card anyways.  I apologize to 
those of you who were expecting this match...but if I do it Tuesday it makes things
MUCH MUCH MUCH easier for me.  Besides, 7 freaking matches...over 50k of just text!
If I had this in HTML format it would be over 100 freaking k, so please, let this
match go...you know how it goes.

I would have had it but you know...my father suprised me, we went to a rayados
game (the Monterry soccer team) And I bet on who would score the first goal 
(a guy from the opposing team Nexuca) and I won 50 hucks!  I don't know why
you care...but that took out my entire day.

Cya,
Mike
