walks to the ring)))

Mike: Well it's about time I came up with an entrance theme for myself!  But

after two delays...sorry about that.  Well also, I don't have too much to say

have some great stuff to watch tonight.  Also, I want to say that Saturday
there will be no Surge because I will be out of the country (OOC: I will be
in Texas, I live in Mexico, and I won't be able to write the results)  I want
to tell all the wrestlers to carry on with their promos as if I was still 
here, I will book the card for the next card, next weeks Taser, Tonight so
you will all have something to roleplay about, plus these matches, so you all
know what to roleplay about and stuff.

(((The lights dim, fireworks blast off like mad and Mike leaves the areana,
Taser has begun)))

Match 1: Tim Star Vr. Crag Vr. Young Blood - Last Man Standing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Johnny: Well I think Creed got jipped out of his first match ever.

Barry: I don't know, I think the shot to the back didn't matter.

Johnny: I don't-

Barry: I don't want to listen to you, so shut up.

Johnny: Whatever...here comes Star.

((( He walks out to fireworks. He usually does something cocky to the fans 
like flip them off and kisses his muslces. He walks down the entrance and 
usually gets cocky a little more when he enters the ring. He gets on a 
turnbuckle and yells stuff at the crowd.)))

Barry: I really am getting sick of you saying Whatever...well here comes 
Crag.

((( A little bit of pyro goes off then water rockets shoot off into the 
crowd getting people close buy soaked. )))

Johnny: And the final man in this Compo. is Young Blood.

((( "Getcha Groove On" By Limp Bizkit and Xzibit blasts into the P.A system 
and Young Blood appears from the backstage area.He stops at the bottom of the 
ramp and raises the roof.Pyro explodes all across the top of the ramp and out 
of every turnbuckle.The fans give him a huge pop.Young Blood begins to walk 
down the entranceway giving five to all the fans.He jumps up onto the ring 
apron and springs himself over the ropes.Young Blood is standing in the 
center of the ring with a microphone,he takes off his sunglasses and is about 
to speak when the crowd interupt him with a chant. YOUNG BLOOD!! YOUNG BLOOD!
YOUNG BLOOD!!)))

Tim Star and Crag start the match by locking up.  Crag wins it and throws 
Tim Star into the ropes and Star flys right through them and to the ground.
Crag runs over to Young Blood and does a quick jab and then throws Young 
Blood to the ropes, but Young Blood stops himself, sees Star getting up at
ringside and jumps over the ropes and takes down Star.  Crag runs over to 
the top ropes and jumps down taking down Young Blood.  Star charges him with
a clothesline and puts Crag to the ground.  Young Blood gets up and does a 
reverse DDT to Star from behind.  Crag gets back up and Young Blood goes for
a punch, but as he moves his fist back a few fans in the front row grab his
arm and stop him from punching Crag.

Barry: Those fans...they love the american hero...  I have to admit though,
I am a patriot and people who fight for my country are good in my book, but
Johnny, you, being the dirty canadian you are probably hate Crag...don't you

Johnny: I don't hate anyone.

Barry: Except me.  

Johnny: Of course.

Barry: I knew it.

Crag smiles at the fans and the fans grab Young Blood by both arms leaving
Young Blood defenseless and Crag does a punch, another, another, and a kick
all to the chest of Young Blood, then Star gets up and does a kick to Crag's
side putting Crag out of the way...he then punches the tied up Young Blood
a few times but the fans sort of slowly let go and Young Blood falls right
to the ground.  Crag Gets up and rolls up Star and gets up without letting
go of Star's leg and does a powerbomb at ringside.   Young Blood slowly gets
up and with all of his power throws Crag, making him go to the ramp.  Young
Blood follows and Star following later.  Crag is waiting for Young Blood
and does a suplex.  The crowd goes wild.

Johnny: Whoa!  That's the steel ramp!

Barry: ooooh, very original...no ones ever heard that line before... I swear
how did you get hired.

Johnny: because I'm good.

Barry: ha, of course you are.

Crag gets up from the Suplex and punches Star who was approaching, he then 
does a clothesline, sending star to the floor, hard.  Crag lifts up Young
Blood and takes him over to the side of the top of the ramp and does a kick
to the stomach and lifts him up to his shoulder and does a body slam, except
right off the edge of the ramp, having Young Blood fall 15 feet down onto a
food table, knocking him out cold.  Star runs over and shoves Crag over the
edge, but at last minute Crag turns around and lands on Star when they hit 
the ground.  All men are out of it: 1........2........3.........4..........5
6.........The crowd is cheering as loud as they can for Crag........7.......
............8 and Crag gets to his knees.......9..............and Crag jumps
to his feet.....10.  And that's it, Crag is the winner.

Barry: There you have it folks, your winner, and our favorite Face, Crag.

Johnny: Good job by Crag in that one.

And the Winner is: Crag

Match 2: Stewart Hix Vr. Scotty Hinton
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Johnny: Well our next Match is with Steward Hix and Scotty Hinton.

Barry: Yeah, but word is that Hix hasn't showed up today.

Johnny: I heard that too, there is a reporter right now going into his locker 
room to check it out.

(((the scene opens to hix's locer room, an OWF reporter is heard looking for him, 
screaming his name, the camera pans all around and finally finds him underneath 
a bench)))

Rookie Reporter: uh...Mr. Hix...are you there?

(((Hix gives no response, the reporter asks several times then touches him and 
rolls him over to reveal tons of blood al over the side of his head...the 
reporter immidiately calls and some help, a few minutes later they run in with 
a strecher and take him out of the room)))

Johnny: uh...I am receing word that...

Barry: That he got his butt whooped and he won't fight tonight because he is a 
pansy.

Johny: Basically... 

And the Winner is:  No Match
********************************************************

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 3: Rex Vr. Creed 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny: Ok, well our next match is Rex and Steven Creed, and here comes Steven
Creed right now.

((( Steven Creed's music comes on and he walks to the ring.  All of a sudden
his music stops and Double C's music comes on and Double C comes out with a 
metal pipe and charges Creed, who hasn't seen him yet.  Double C hits Creed 
in the back with a pipe and runs back away.)))

Johnny: What was Conte doing?

Barry:  Gee...I wonder...he only hit Creed in the back with a frigging pipe!

Johnny: I know that.

Barry: Then what don't you understand?

Johnny: forget it.

Barry: No!  I won't just forget it!

Johnny: Whatever, well here comes Rex.

Barry: Saved by the intro...as always.

((( The lights go out as music plays. A few moments later, two loud booms are 
heard as pyro goes off at the top of the ramp on both sides of it. As the pyro 
starts to clear, Rex is shown in the center of it as he is starting to look up. 
He then walks down the ramp and walks to the ring steps. He enters the ring 
and goes to the far left corner and turns around to wait for his opponent.)))

Barry: Well here we go.

Rex charges Creed and gets him in a headlock for a few seconds then lets go
and elbows Creed where he was just hit with the pipe.  Rex moves a few steps
away.  He then charges Creed going for a spear but Creed moves out of the
way.  Creed gets up, grabs his back, does a stretch and walks over to Rex. 
Then Creed gets in a tie up and puts Rex on his shoulder, but he lands a 
body slam sloppily because of his back problem, right after that he grabs 
his back in pain.  He shakes it off but is still obviously in alot of hurt,
he goes over to Rex and kicks him in the side a few times.

Johnny: When all else fails kick em in the side.

Barry: or the nuts.

Johnny: WHAT!?!

Barry: What, are you suprised just because I said something that wasn't in 
the cue cards?  Sue me.

Rex rolls over to the corner ad Creed stumbles to his knees grabbing his 
back...both are in pain, and they take a few seconds to get back their 
energy.  Rex is the first one up and charges Creed and takes him down. Creed
falls over and Rex goes to the ropes.  Creed is on his knees grabbing his 
back as Rex comes right at him with a knee to the chin.  Creed immidiately 
falls back first into the mat and grabs his back and lets out a scream.

Johnny: ouch...he's in alot of pain.

Barry: haha, yeah, and it's all Conte's fault, hey Conte, I just gained that
much extra respect for you.

Johnny: Like he really cares...

Barry: Watch it...watch it.

Rex climbs to the top ropes and gets his balance, he puts his arms out and
closes his eyes to concentrate.  He throws himself out horizontally and does
a 360 degree spin frog splash and lands it.  He gets up and rolls over Creed
so he is face first.  He jumps on Creeds back and turns him over again.  
He then jumps knee first and goes for the pin: 1.........2..........3 and 
Rex wins.

Barry: haha!  And the winner...REX!

Johnny: Only on account of villainy.

Barry: stop using big words, I'm not impressed.

And the Winner is: Rex

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 4: Mr. Tokyo Vr. New Model - .ORG title
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Johnny: Well this is a hardcore match for the .ORG title, the title once held 
by Marasmus for a VERY long time, and I garuntee you it is only a matter of time 
before Marasmus demands it back.

Barry: Quit your whining.

Johnny: What???

Barry: Nothing...well anyways, yeah, last saturday it was Marasmus New Model and 
Shawn Matthews for the .ORG title, New Model won so now, on Tuesday, he will have 
to defend it against the man who beat Mac Daddy for the .ORG contendership-

((( The place goes dark and the crowd starts to buzz. Smoke fills the entrance way. 
The beginning of "The House of the Rising Sun" starts but is scratched off and 
"Fight Fire with Fire" starts pumping over the speakers. Mr. Tokyo's entrance video 
plays over the Jumbotron. Mr. Tokyo walks through the smoke and to the ring with a 
deadly serious look on his face. He waists no time rolling into the ring. He takes 
a vial from his tights and sips. He shoots a grey mist over the ring and grins 
evily into the camera. )))

Johnny: Mr. Tokyo

Barry: Oh, aren't you cool...well here comes his opponent, and the man that WILL 
WIN, the New Model.

(((An explosion erupts on both sides of the entrance area. The New Model then walks 
out very casualy. He glances around the arena, usually points out an individual and 
laughs at them. Then he continues his stroll to the ring. When he gets there, he 
motions for the crowd to give him more of a pop. When they don't, he gestures for 
them to go home because he doesn't need them anyway)))

Johnny: How do you know he will win?

Barry: trust me, i have a...hunch

New Model and Tokyo stare each other down for a few seconds and then Tokyo makes the 
first move by quickly grabbing a chair on the ground and charging New Model and 
hitting him in the head with it. New Model is dazed, but doesn't hit the ground. Tokyo 
takes the chair again and slams New Model in the chest with it, sending him to the 
turnbuckle and he grabs it to rest. Tokyo wastes no time and charges him with a 
clothesline and then goes to the top rope and does a spinning DDT right onto New Model.

Johnny: Looks like you are on the right track in your prediction.

Barry: I will win, you'll see...hey, by the way, why don't you go by the name Johnny 
No Good anymore? Is it Johnny All Bad now or something?

Johnny: Shut up, ok.

Barry: I'll talk if I want to, you gotta respect me. 

Johnny: For what!?!

Barry: Hell in a cell...don't need to say ANY More.

Tokyo goes to the top rope and goes for a asian moonsault, but New Model rolls out of 
the ring and Tokyo falls on his back on the mat. New Model walks out of the ring and 
picks out a table from under the ring and sets it up at ringside, he goes back in the 
ring and picks up Tokyo and goes for a suplex. He throws Tokyo over the top rope in a 
suplex and lets go, thinking that Tokyo will fall on the table and break it, but as 
soon as Tokyo is let go he lands feet first on the table, not breaking it, he suprises 
New Model and pulls him by the legs out to the table, both stand on the table and 
punch for a little. Tokyo throws New Model out into the crowd, the front row people 
quickly move out of the way, causing New model to fall out onto all the tables. Tokyo 
follows and jumps from the barricade onto new model. He lifts up a chair and hits him 
with it.

Johnny: God...your odds are looking great here barry.

Barry: Shut up, I really don't like you right now.

Then all of a sudden some fan wearing and American flag shirt turns around Tokyo and 
takes his chair and hits in the face with it, the guy was weak so Tokyo shakes it 
off and pulls him over the banister back to ringside. He picks him up and throws him 
right on top of the table, which still doesn't break. Tokyo takes the fan and does a 
piledriver on him, immidiately making all the Californians boo, the table still 
doesn't break but did it's job, Tokyo throws aside the limp fan and goes back into 
the crowd, where he is greeted by nothing more than full, unopened Miller Genuine 
draft beer cans. He grabs his arm in pain and quickly gets out of the crowd, New Model 
following. He jumps back in the ring and New Model follows soon after while the gaurds 
try to stop the people from throwing stuff. New Model picks up a beer can and smashes 
it on Mr. Tokyo's head. Tokyo shows a little signs of beign dazed but runs to the 
corner and grabs his own, the winds up and throws it right at New Model, hitting him 
right in the nuts.

Johnny: Ouch.

Barry: I wonder if there are any Angel's baseball team recruiters here, they might 
want this guy, nice speed, perfect accuracy, looks good.

New Model grabs his nuts in pain and Tokyo lifts him up and brings him to the turnbuckle 
where he proceeds to punch him many times. He then goes to the top ropes with New Model, 
who was once limp but is gettin back his strength. He is about to go for a super plex 
but New Model shows some signs of resisting. New Model then pushes as hard as he can and 
Tokyo falls backwards, but grabs New Model's head. He then falls all the way back and 
lands right on the table, finally breaking, and lands an impromptu DDT, knocking out New 
Model and making Tokyo weak from the fall.

Barry: It's about time that table broke.

Johnny: your chances aren't looking good at all.

Barry: Who cares, I'll get em next time.

Tokyo and New Model lay there for a few seconds and then all of a sudden Purple Haze 
runs out to the ring.

Johnny: 100 to 1 that Purple Haze gets revenge on New Model for having them loose the 
Tag Titles on Saturday.

Barry: Uh...New model is kind of already out of it...

Johnny: So.

Purple Haze comes in and looks at New Model and is about to punch him but at the last 
minute punches Tokyo, Tokyo gets woken back up from that, grabs a peice of the table 
and hits Haze in the face with it, Haze falls backwards and Tokyo's momentum from that 
move causes him to fall right on New Model for the pin: 1......2.......3 and Tokyo is 
the new .ORG champion! Right then Haze gets up, realized what happened and lifts up 
New Model helping him out of the ring.

Barry: What is that all about?

Johnny: I don't know, all I do know is that there is a new .ORG champion.



And the Winner is: Mr. Tokyo, The New .ORG Champion

Match 5: Scotty Hinton Interview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny: I am getting word we have a reporter, apparently Scotty Hinton has 
something to say to the world...let's see what it is.

(((The scene shifts to the hallway of the arena where Hinton is talking to an
OWF reporter)))

Reporter: Well Mr. Hinton, I hear you have something to say...but first, what 
about your scheduled match with Stewart Hix?  What do you think happened?

Hinton: What do I THINK happened...no no no, I KNOW what happened, I should 
know, I WAS THE ONE THAT DID THAT!  What can I say, when you are a bit 
impatient and it is Halloween Night...what can you do besides hit your opponent
with a bat with barbed wire rubbed around it!

Reporter: What!  It was you!  Why couldn't you have just waited!

Hinton: Do you listen to a word I say!  I was impatient!  Well I don't want to
talk to you anymore, I'm out.

(((Hinton shoves the Reporter and camera man out of the way and leaves)))

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 5: Shawn Matthews Vr. Flash
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Johnny: Well our next match is one that everyone has been waiting for-- a one 
on one match in which Shawn Matthews.

Barry: Yeah, but this is NON title, which means no one cares at all.

Johnny: Shut up.

Barry: Ok man, you are getting TOO close to that line that you can't cross.

Johnny: Oh look...Flash

(((As his music plays, a blue strobe light tunrs on as the lights go out. Then 
fireworks shoot off and Flash walks out form the back. )))

Barry: you are always lucky...and here is Shawn Matthews...

(((The arena goes black. Then on the screen above the entrance the word WARNING 
flashes in red. Firworks shoot straight up on each side of the entrance & Danger 
Zone starts to play. As the lights come on Shawn is standing looking straight at 
the entrance. He walks down the to the ring looking around the arena. He slides 
underneath the ropes & spreads his arms wide open & turns 360 degrees around 
looking at the whole entire arena.))) 

Johnny: Well here we go...lets see if Matthews remembers how to fight one on
one...

Flash and Matthews eye each other for a little bit and then Matthews charges
Flash and lands a bulldog.  Flash and Matthews quickly get up and exchange 
punch after punch.  Matthews blocks a punch by Flash and puts Flash into an
arm wrench.  Flash screams in pain and kicks Matthews in the stomach.  
Matthews lets go and Flash knees Matthews in the gut.  Matthews grabs his 
guy and Flash does a neckbreaker.  He lifts Matthews up and they lock up.
Matthews gains the power and does a fishermen's suplex on Flash.  Flash falls
to the ground and Matthews goes for a elbow drop but Flash rolls out of the
way and Matthews misses.  Matthews gets up with flash and Flash does a Samoen
Drop onto Matthews.  Matthews gets up and is greeted by a right hook, left, 
right, left, right, left, BLOCK.  Matthews grabs Flash's head and locks him up
in a headlock.  

Johnny: Looks like Matthews hasn't forgot much.

Barry: What did I say.

Johnny: Uh....nothing.

Barry: Hey, back up man, you got a bad memory.

Johnny: Oh, do I?

Flash throws Matthews to the corner but Matthews reverses it and throws Flash
to the turnbuckle.  Matthews follows and grabs Flash's head and brings him to
the top ropes.  He sets Flash up and does a powerbomb off the top ropes.  He
goes for the pin but then all of a sudden Jake Keeton's music comes on.  He
comes out accompanied by...STEWART HIX!  Stewart Hix still has blood on his 
head and they are both wearing FTW shirts, presumably the shirts of their new
stable.  Hix and Keeton run in and do a double suplex on Matthews but then
Scotty Hinton and Mr. Tokyo run to the ring!  They come up and go over to
Hinton, by this time Flash is up and is encouraging the fight but is resting,
getting up some energy.  Then all of a sudden instead of Punching the 
unsuspecting Hix, Tokyo punches Flash.  Hinton helps Tokyo take out flash, they
do a version of the DDD and then lift him up and do a powerbomb.  

Barry: WHAT IS GOING ON!  HIX, KEETON AND TOKYO, HINTON HATE EACH OTHER!!! WHAT
ARE THEY DOING!

Johnny: I don't know, what is going on!

Hinton and Tokyo then go over to Hix and Keeton and help take out Matthews! They
go over and take down Matthews 4 on 1.  They grab Matthews and take him over to
Flash.  They lay flash on top of Matthews.  All through this the ref has no clue
what to do, it is 4 against one and both people were interfered with, so he doesn't
do anything but keep the ref going (they are not the smartest refs in the world)
They lay flash on Matthews and the ref does the count as they leave the ring:
1.........2...........3 and Flash wins it!

All 4 men go to the top of the ramp and Tokyo and Hinton rip off their shirts
and underneath have FTW T-Shirts on!  All 4 men grab hands, take a bow, and 
fireworks go off beneath them, the crowd is BOOING constantly as all of the 
heels they hate the most are now joined up as one group.

Johnny: They really did have me there.

Barry: Yep, I didn't even see it coming...this is going to be big folks...really
big.

And the Winner is: Flash (READ WHY!!!)

Match 6: Jake Keeton Vr. Dread X - .COM title
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Johnny: well here we go...remember when this title was held by Crossbones 
for so long?

Barry: What... the man you love?

Johnny: Forget it.

Barry: Yes, I will...or I'll at least try...

Johnny: Look, here comes Jake Keeton...and you gotta shut up man.

((( Sirens begin to blare across the PA and and a bright white strobe light 
begins to flash wildly above the entrance. As the sirens slow down Jake Keetons 
voice comes over the PA saying "Now I know why you wanna hate me." which leads 
into "Take a Look Around" by Limp Bizkit. The fans erupt into a chorus of boos 
as Jake steps through the curtian and makes his way to the ring.  )))

Barry: What?  Look, HIC, Hell In a Cell...remember.

Johnny: Forget it...here comes Dread X.

((( After Break Stuff hits Dread X walks out and red pyros shoot out of the 
stage. Dread X pours water over his head and walks down top the ring.  )))

Jake Keeton and Dread X look at each other for a few seconds...then Keeton
jumps up and they get into a lock up.  They fight for power for a few 
seconds and Keeton slips his foot behind Dread X's ankle and Dread X falls
to the ground and Keeton soon follows with an elbow to the chest of Dread X.
Keeton hops up and goes for another elbow drop but Dread X rolls out of the
way and Keeton's elbow hits the mat hard.  Dread X gets up and kicks Keeton
in the side and does a knee drop onto Keeton's back.  Keeton bends his back
in pain as Dread X does a leg drop.  Keeton rolls out of the way and Dread
X lands his tailbone right into the mat.

Johnny: Ouch.

Barry: I swear, if I here you say "ouch" one more time today I will loose it

Johnny: Ouch...that hurts.

Barry: You know, I really am getting tempted to challenge you to another 
match.

Keeton gets up and pulls up Dread X.  They lock up and Keeton does a 
vertical suplex, holding Dread X in the air for several seconds and then 
slamming him down as hard as he could to the mat.  Dread X pops right back
up and limps over to the ropes, almost falls over, but uses the ropes to 
keep his balance.  Keeton runs over and goes for a clothesline into the 
ropes but Dread X ducks and spears Keeton on his way.  Keeton gets back up
and lifts Dread X on his shoulders and does a 180 degree spin and slams
Dread X to the ground.  Keeton goes to the top ropes but Dread X runs over
and Keeton jumps back to the ground before Dread X can screw him up.  

Barry: Ok, granted, smart choice by Keeton, but that won't win him the .COM
championship.

Johnny: Yeah, but being risky won't have him win it either.

Barry: Shut up.

Johnny: I am sick of hearing you say Shut up, really.

Dread X goes and locks up with Keeton.  He puts him in an arm lock, but 
Keeton gets out of it and slams him face first to the ground.  Keeton kicks
the back of Dread X's head and goes to the top rope.  He gets his balance
and goes for a moonsault.  He does it and Dread X tries to move, but as 
Dread X is on his knees Keeton lands right on his back, sending Dread X 
straight back to the ground and Keeton with the wind knocked out of him.  
Keeton gets back up and as Dread X is getting to his hands and knees he 
kicks him in the stomach making Dread X fall on his back and Keeton goes
for the pin: 1..........2............3 and Keeton is the new .COM champion!

Barry: Ha!  Keeton IS the new .COM champion...whoa

Johnny: He deserved it, he made the right choices.

Barry: It's luck, he won't win next time.

Johnny: yeah...sure...

Barry: You'll see...just wait.

Johnny: Uh-huh...I know...

And the Winner is: Jake Keton, the new .COM champion

Match 7: Survivor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(((Mike's Music comes on and he walks to the ring)))

Barry: I hope he fires someone like he always does.

Mike: No, I did not come here to fire anyone, I came here to clarify the teams. 
First off, as we have seen some people have been voted off and fired. Crossbones 
and Bungalow Bill have been voted off. Then there are some who are fired, Mark 
Blaze, Shady, Dirty Russian, and Arch Angel So what this means is those 2 are 
voted off and then there are 4 people whom were automatically off the tribe. 
But I think there are people who deserve to be in the pool, I wish everyone 
could, but here are the old teams, minus people voted off and fired:

Team 1:            Team 2:
Marasmus           Night Crawler
Saynt              Mr. Tokyo
Bloodshed          Crag 
Lowell             Purple Haze
Scotty Hinton
Angel

So what this means is that there are 4 free spots, 3 for Team 2 and 1 for Team 
1....Well let's fill those slots up! First, Team 1 will have Flash. Team 2 will 
have Steven Creed, Stewart Hix and Jake Keeton. So our final teams are:

Team 1:           Team 2:
Marasmus          Night Crawler
Saynt             Mr. Tokyo
Bloodshed         Crag 
Lowell            Purple Haze
Scotty Hinton     STEWART HIX
Angel             JAKE KEETON
FLASH             STEVEN CREEED

Voted off: Voted off:
Crossbones Bungalow Bill (also fired)

Ok, also, the loosing team will have to vote TWO people out before Tuesday 
(remember, no Surge, I won't be here) So TWO people will leave their team next 
Survivor Tuesday.  Ok, so let's get on with the fight! 

(((With that, Mike leaves the ring and the match begins)))

Johnny: Two people, that means the loosing team will have a major disadvantage.

Barry: Not necessarily, maybe the next immunity challenge will be a 1 on 1, two 
on two or three on three, where the teams will be evenly matched...Mike's pretty 
smart.

Johnny: Yeah, but the team that looses will have less people to choose from.

Barry: My word is prophetic, now shut up.

Johnny: yeah, sure it is...

Barry: I'm sensing a little bit of sarcasm...that pisses me off.

Johnny: I don't care.

Barry: You should.

Johnny: Oh, here they come.

Barry: Lucky.

(((One after another Marasmus' music comes on and he walks out without Lizzy, Mike 
has declaredno valets at ringside for this match. Before Marasmus is in the ring 
Crag's music comes on andhe walks to the ring, followed by Mr. Tokyo's music and 
finally Scotty Hinton's music followed byScotty Hinton bringing up the starting 
rear.)))

They all take a corner, and the bell rings and the clock starts. Tokyo and Hinton 
nod at each other. And both charge opposite people, Tokyo going for Marasmus and 
Hinton going for Crag. Both men lock up and at the same time Tokyo and Hinton do 
suplex's at the exact same time to their opponents. Both men are on the ground as 
Tokyo and Hinton get up. They pause several seconds to look at each other and go 
back and kick their opponents. At the same time they lift up their opponents and 
throw them out the ring. There are 5 more seconds before a new person comes in, 
so both go to a corner and look at each other and don't fight.

Barry: Ha, they'll need to fight each other sooner or later...

Johnny: They are friends, what can we say.

Barry: We are friends and we fought.

Johnny: We're not friends...trust me...

Barry: Fine...but we won't be anything more.

Johnny: Did you hear me say that?

The next two people to come in are Night Crawler and Angel. Angel and Night 
Crawler both charge Tokyo and Hinton, Angel gets Tokyo and Night Crawler gets 
Hinton.

Johnny: Why?

Barry: Because Tokyo and Hinton are in love and they are just bringing their teams 
down because they won't fight each other. 

Angel goes immidiately to the top rope and does "from the heavens" and amazing 
flip and spin move onto Tokyo knocking him out. Tokyo falls to the ground and Angel 
lifts him up and throws him out the ring. Night Crawler runs in and does a 
piledriver to Hinton and throws Hinton out the ring. Angel and Night Crawler then 
look at each other and run to lock up. Angel is much smaller so he is at the 
disadvantage by far. Night Crawler overpowers Angel and lands puts him on his shoulder 
and does a body slam. Angel gets back up and the minute alarm goes off and 2 new 
people come to the ring: Flash and Steven Creed. Both run in but Creed gets there 
first and Runs at Angel. Him and Night Crawler lift up Angel but Angel does a backflip 
off both of their arms. Creed comes in and they do a double clothesline on Flash. 
Flash falls to the ground. Creed and Angel both then do a roundhouse kick onto Night 
Crawler, making Night Crawler take a few steps back but come back at Creed with a 
clothesline. Flash gets up and grabs Creed from behind. Angel runs to the top rope 
and without wasting any time jumps off and grabs the neck of Night Crawler in mid 
air and brings him to the ground. Angel helps Creed get up and they go over and lift 
up Night Crawler and bring him over to the ropes, Flash gets up and pushes Angel, 
Angel falls over the top ropes but brings Night Craweler with him.

Barry: In order for any progress to be made there needs to be the sacrifices.

Johnny: I disagree.

Barry: You would.

Johnny: What’s that supposed to mean?

Barry: nothing, now shut up and listen.

Johnny: To what?

Barry: Me.

Johnny: oh...

The one minute bell rings and 2 new people come to the ring: Haze and Saynt. They 
run in and Haze takes down Saynt before he get to the ring and then runs to the 
ring. Flash awaits Haze but as soon as he gets in Creed grabs Flash from behind 
and does a body slam, which seems to be the move of the match. Creed picks up flash 
but in the process Saynt runs in and kicks Haze in the back and runs over to Creed 
and kicks him in the chin. He lifts up Creed and does a suplex right over the top 
ropes, Making Creed fall hard on the ground. The bell rings and Haze runs over to 
Saynt and clotheslines him over the top rope, which is not what Saynt was expecting
--he was waiting for the new entrant. The next two people to come in are Stewart 
Hix and Bloodshed. While they come to the ring Haze and Flash exchange punches. Hix 
gets to the ring first and punches Flash right in the cheek, knocking him over to 
the turnbuckles. Hix follows him and picks him up and takes him to the top rope. He 
gets ready for a superplex, but Bloodshed comes in the ring and Haze grabs him and 
puts him in a DDT. Hix, who didn’t see this, does the superplex right onto Bloodshed. 
Both Bloodshed and Flash are knocked out. Hix and Haze lift up Bloodshed and take 
him to the ropes. They throw him over the top rope and they look back but Flash is 
not where they left him. They look for him and they turn around to see Flash balancing 
on the ropes and then he does a flying clothesline right onto Haze. He quickly lifts 
him up and does a back body drop to him right over the top rope. The bell rings and 
the last two entrants come into the ring: Lowell and Keeton. They run objectively to 
the ring and when they get there they each take a man, Hix is already fighting with 
Flash so Keeton goes there for a little to help him out.

Barry: Well team 2 is going to win.

Johnny: Why would you say that?

Barry: Because Keeton and Hix are like lovers, they can’t loose.

Johnny: whatever...

Hix and Keeton throw Flash over the top rope as soon as Lowell gets into the ring. 
They charge Lowell with a double clothesline but he ducks and then he turns around 
and clotheslines both of them to the ground. Hix gets up and soon after Keeton gets 
up. They run at him and both kick him to the stomach and back, Lowell doesn’t stand 
much against 2 men who have been a tag team for a long time. They both lift him up 
and do a double suplex, landing him hard onto the mat. Hix goes to the corner to rest 
and signals for Keeton to finish it off and Keeton does a vertical suplex and then 
lifts him up and throws him over the ring.

Barry: What did I tell you.

Johnny: I dont’ know...

Barry: I was right...end of story.
