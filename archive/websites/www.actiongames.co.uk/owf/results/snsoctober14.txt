!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tonight, on Surge:
------------------
6 matches, a record for any TV show, basically to make
up for the low amount of matches on Tuesday...so here it
is...Saturday Night Surge!
--------------------------------------------------------
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


****************************************
(((The fans sit in their chair, the usual, gossip about what is going to
happen tonight...finally the lights go out and Mike Wycklendt himself walks
out to the ring)))

Mike: Whadup everyone...well tonight we have a good show for you, a solid
5 matches...but what I came out here to do is announce who is out of the
Survivor pool.  So without further ado...with 3 votes-

(((The lights go out...Saynt's music comes on)))

Mike: WTF???

Saynt: Yo yo yo, Mike, Me and Bloodshed ain'ts ready to fight tonight man, 
it just ain't gonna go down tonight...instead, for the Tag Team championship
me and Marasmus, my brother and I, would like a match against Purple Haze 
and Jekel, the other two identical people in the fed, and Mike, this IS 
going to happen.

Mike: uh...well Haze has a match with Flagg.

Saynt: so, let that one go first then.

Mike: and Marasmus has a match with Blaze.

Saynt: Let that go first too so it's even.  It's perfect, now this is gonna
happen.

Mike:...uhok.

(((Saynt walks away)))

Mike: Ok, so now what I wanted to say before Saynt came out here...is the
person kicked out of Survivor.  Nightcrawler, Purple Haze and 
Shady, you received one vote each.  Mr. Tokyo, you received 2 votes.  
Bungalow Bill, you received 3 votes, thus meaning you are the first person 
voted out of the pool.

Mike: Ok then, now that that is over with, lets get on with the card!
Oh wait, but before that I want to say, each team must pick who they want
to compete in a tag team match on Tuesday for immunity, you may do this on 
the roleplay board.  If a team fails to choose I will choose.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 1: Scotty Hinton Vr. Crag
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny: So Bungalow Bill is the first one voted off the team...so here we 
go...this next match is Crag and Scotty Hinton, as we all saw Hinton is very
expressive about his feelings toward Crag in Canada...all we can say is from
what it looked like we are lucky this is not Canada, I have no idea what the
citizens of Canada would do to Crag.

Barry: I like Crag, the guy is good to his home country, my home country,
Crag, you rule.

Johnny: I don't now, I think Hinton is pretty good also...

Barry: You would...well speaking of the best wrestler out there...

(((A little bit of pyro goes off and then water rockets shoot off into the 
crowd getting people soaked...Crag comes out and the crowd goes nuts)))

Barry: There he is, Captain America, Crag.

Johnny: And here comes his opponent:

(((The lights go out of the arena as the crowd readies for another 
entranc by Scotty Hinton.  The beginning of "falling away from me' is heard
as the lights start flashing blue all over the arena.  The song kicks into
high gear and a huge pyro erupts in the doorway.  Standing there waving to
his many fans is Scotty Hinton.  He walks to the ring avoiding the cokes and
other things being hurled at him by the non-Hintonites and hopes into the
ring, staring straight at Crag)))

Right away Hinton throws Crag into the turn buckle, runs at him and does
an avalanche.  Crag falls down a little to the turnbuckle, Hinton backs up
and gets ready to do some sort of bronco buster move, but Crag gets out
of the way and Pushes Hinton's head into the turnbuckle.  Crag picks up 
Hinton and goes for a back breaker, and does it.

Barry: There we go Mr. America!!!

Crag lifts up Hinton again, looks him in the eyes, sings the first bit of
the American national anthem and hums it as he lands an Atomic Drop.  He
goes to the top rope and looks for cheers from the audience, receives it, 
and goes for a 450 splash, but doesn't land it, Hinton gets up and sings the
first bit of the Canadian national anthem as the crowd boos.  He grabs 
Crag and does a arm grapevine, Crag screams in pain.  He reaches for the 
ropes but can't get there.  He screams as loud as he  can.

Johnny: Nice submission.

Barry: Thats what you would say, come on man, Crag represents our country!

Johnny: Fine, I need to confess something.  I am canadian.

Barry: WHAT!!!!

Johnny: at least part...my grandparents were born in Canada and my parents
were born in the states.

Barry: Either way, that is sick man.

Johnny: How would that be sick?

Barry: I just can't look at you in the same light again.

Finally Crag makes his way to the ropes.  He gets up and grabs his arm in
pain, but he charges Hinton and does a bearhug...Hinton is in lots of pain,
Crag drops him to the ground, lifts him up, kicks him in the stomach and 
does a back suplex.  Hinton hits the mat hard.  Crag lifts up Hinton and
goes for a Bulldog but Hinton pushes Crag off of him.  Hinton does a belly-
back suplex on Crag.  Crag hits the mat and Hinton goes to the top rope and
does a flying senton splash and lands it...he goes for the pin: 1...2.....
and Crag jumps out.  Hinton does an elbow drop to the knee of Crag and 
and then another one.  Crag grabs his knee.  Hinton goes to the top rope
again and does a flying somersault dropkick.  He goes for the pin: 1......2
........and Crag jumps out yet again. The crowd goes wild.

Barry: I'd like to see a Canadian jump out after all that.

Johnny: It was a canadian that DID all that to Crag.

Barry: Just shut up...ok...just shut up...

Hinton goes to the top rope as Crag still lys on the ground, he looks to the
crowd and smiles, then, someone throws a beer can in Hinton's direction, 
then another, and another, Hinton starts dodging the beer cans, most empty, 
but then one comes that is full and unopen, it hits Hinton in the face and 
he looses his balance and falls backwards to ringside on his back.

Barry: OOOOOOHHHHH that's an american for you...

Johnny: what, needing other people to help him?

Barry: Yes in a way, teamwork, and the fact that we fight for what we 
beleive in!

Johnny: you are forgetting!!! I am american too!!!

Barry: But you are a descendent of Canada, you...you...filthy canadian!

The crowd chants for Crag to get up, he finally gets up, goes to the rope
where Hinton was and smiles after seeing all the cans surronding Hinton 
lying in pain on the ground.   He does a leap of faith to ringside from the
top rope and lands a diving elbow smash right on Hinton, he picks Hinton up
and throws him into the ring then quickly goes for the pin: 1....2....3.

Johnny: That pin looked awfully quick...

Barry: it's all your imagination, now shut the hell up.

And the Winner is:  Crag
********************************************************
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 2: Purple Haze Vr. Jack Flagg--I quit Match
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barry: and the American comes out on top, how it should be.  Well anyways,
this next match is an I Quit match between Jack Flagg and...

(((The arena goes black, all of a sudden there is an explosion where the 
wrestlers enter from.  a single beam of purple light focuses on the entry
way and Purple Haze blares over the PA system and Purple Haze walks out, and
a multitude of psychadelic colors flash over the crowd, he looks arond, then
runs full bore to the ring, slides under the ropes, rns to the corners and
jumps up to the second turnbuckle and raises his arms out to the side with
his hands open.)))

Johnny: and his oponnent, Jack Flag (((the crowd boos amazingly)))

(((Jack Flagg walks to the ring, no entrance at all...the crowd throws 
anything they can at him)))

Barry: haha, this crowd is VIOLENT! you gotsta love it.

Haze charges Flagg and does a back heel kick.  Right after that he does a 
backspin DDT.  Haze lifts him up and does a back fist.

Barry: Bitch slap, gotta love it.

Haze quickly grabs Flagg by the neck and does a Jumping DDT, planting Flaggs
head to the ground.  He lifts him up and does a Japanese arm takedown.  Haze
goes for the pin: 1....2......Haze could have easily had it but he gets up.
He goes for a cradle suplex and lands it.  Haze smiling at how easily he is
destroying Flagg goes to the top rope and does a diving headbutt, lands it 
perfectly.  Haze starts laughing after hearing the laughter and cheers from
the crowd.

Barry: hahaha, this is sick!  Flagg sucks!

Haze lifts him up, and goes for a double arm DDT...and to no suprise lands 
it.  Haze is grabbing his stomach now at how bad Flagg is losing. Haze
goes to the top rope again and does s somersault leg drop onto Flagg, and
lands it perfectly on Flagg, the sitting duck.  He goes back to the top
ropes and does a split legged moonsault, and lands it perfectly again!  

Johnny: Oh god, just go for the pin already!

Barry: Why??? This is too funny.

Haze lifts up Flagg and does a spinning headscissors...the ref pulls Haze
aside and tells Haze to go for the pin already...Haze doesn't listen.  He
throws Flagg to the side ropes and does a spinning bulldog from the top 
ropes.  He throws Flagg's limp body to the ropes and goes to the top rope 
and does a top rope powerbomb.  Flagg is bleeding from the nose now.  Haze
looks, laughs and does the Purple Driver, lifts him up and does the Purple
Driver AGAIN!!!

Barry: 2 purple drivers, Flagg could be clinically, or at least, mentally
dead.

Haze shrugs and finally decides to go for the pin: 1.......................
2..........................................................................
3 and Haze wins the match.

Barry: Oh my god was that a slaughter, you can even tell because that was
the slowest count I have ever seen in my life.  Jack Flagg was jobbed, 
simple as that.

(((Mike walks to the ring.)))

Mike: Flagg, you're fired.

Barry: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Johnny: Barry, a man lost his job.

Barry: but man, he deserved to loose it.
And the Winner is: Purple Haze by a landslide
********************************************************
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 3: Mustafa Vr. Genocide: Jobber match (last chance)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny: What we have here is a

Barry: -classic jobber match.  These guys suck, you see, in the OWF 2000 
Mike doesn't beleive in low card, mid card, and high card matches, he books
the matches and puts them anywhere on the card.

Johnny: Pretty much...now we have seen a little from Mustafa, but absolutely
nothing from Genocide...so I think it is a good guess as to who will win 
this one...

(((Genocide, followed by Mustafa walk to the ring.)))

The two wrestlers stare at each other they charge each other and each try
a spear, but instead hit heads.  They both fall to the ground: the ref 
starts the count: 1.........2.......3....4.......5..........6......7......
8............9..........10 and no one wins.

Johnny: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA

Barry: finally man, a sense of humor, good job....that was pretty funny man

Johnny: Oh wait, here comes mike...

Mike: Hey guys, guess what, you are fired....you too hades...now get your 
asses out of here!!! (the crowd cheers that Mike finally got rid of three 
guys who never made themselves public)

(((Mike walks away.)))

OOC: come on, did you really think I would waste my time on writing a match 
good when one person roleplayed once (7 lines) and the other didn't roleplay 
at all...no way.  And mustafa owned Hades too, who also never, ever 
roleplayed...no personal offense to each of you guys, I am making it better
for you, obviousy you didn't have time, the OWF 2000 would just be a burdon
for you, forget it....

And the winner is: No one
***************************************************************************
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 4: Mark Blaze Vr. Marasmus: .ORG title
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny: Well that's something, 4 guys have been fired tonight.

Barry: it makes sense, Mike wants to weed out the bad guys, the ones that
never roleplay, I know Mike, and he won't fire someone if they don't 
roleplay the best, but still roleplay alot and have fun...because that is 
what wrestling is all about...

Johnny: yeah, you should read Mike's Press releases on FWLNET.com...they are
really interesting... (end shameless self promosion.)

Barry: Well this next match is a hardcore match, Mark Blaze Vr. Marasmus for
the .ORG title.  So lets get going!

(((The lights go out and then an eerie red light fills the ring and entrance
way.  The music plays and red mist fills up by the curtains leading from the
backstage to the arena.  A womanly figure steps through the mist and stops.
When she stops, Marasmus omes out in perfect tune with the music.  They make
their way to the ring and Marasmus goes betwee the ropes as Lizzy uses the 
steps.  Marasmus then lifts the bottom rope for lizzy and she bends all the
way over and under, much to the delight of the male audience.

Barry: That's what I'm talking about.

(((Mark Blaze walks to the ring)))

Johnny: uh oh.

Barry: can you say forshadow???

Marasmus charges Mark Blaze and does a dropkick to the chest.  Immidiately 
afterwards he picks up Mark Blaze and does a spinning powerbomb.   Mark
Blaze  hits the mat hard.  Marasmus goes to the top rope and does a 
spinning moonsault.  Marasmus goes to the top rope and does a flip from the
top rope onto Mark Blaze.  

Johnny: Nice move.

Barry: We all know what is really going on inside your mind...(gay thoughts)

Johnny: you're sick man.  

Barry: no that would be you.

Johnny: you're comebacks are lame yo.

Marasmus goes and grabs a ladder from under the ring.  He throws it into
the ring and sets it up--on the turnbuckle.  He signals for Lizzy to come
over and help keep it balanced.   Be climbs the 20 foot ladder, which is 
really about 45 feet off the ground because it is on top of the turnbuckle.
Marasmus climbs it and it is very, very wobbly, you can see that he wants to
get down but can't because he has already gone this far and can't dissapoint
the fans.  He climbs to the top, his head being some 50 feet above the 
ground and 35 feet above the mat.  He puts his arms to the side to get 
balance and does a triple flip off the ladder and lands back first onto 
Mark Blaze.  The crowd goes absolutely wild.  

Barry: You have no idea how dangerous that was.

Mark Blaze is out cold and spitting blood rolling around on the ground, 
Marasmus gets up and shakes a little then runs to ringside and grabs a 
chair.  He runs in the ring and does a flip and while in the air drops the
chair on Mark Blaze and stomps on it when his feet come back to the ground.
as he stomps on the chair which is on Mark Blaze's chest Blood comes out
Mark Blaze's mouth.  Marasmus slams the chair in Blaze's face a few more
times, he runs outside of the ring and grabs the .ORG belt.  He runs back
in the ring and set it on Mark Blaze's face, he puts his foot on it and 
scrapes Blaze's face with his foot, leaving a cut up face of Blaze.  
Marasmus goes for the pin: 1.....2.........3 and Marasmus keeps his title.

Johnny: that's the third slaughter of the night!

(((Mike walks to the ring.)))

Barry: here it comes

Mike: Hey Marasmus, you're fired.  haha, just kidding, Blaze, you are gone
man....(OOC) no one else saw this, but on AOL he was constantly saying how
much you all suck at roleplaying and how he could kick your asses and how
none of you could beat him...how stupid does that sound....it is a text 
based roleplaying game, and guess what Blaze, you just lost horribly.  You 
see how easy it was?  everyone read my columns on FWNLET, I talk about
egos in ewrestling and how people think hey are so great....Blaze, you suck
you could be great, but your attitude sucks ass.

And the Winner is:  Marasmus, The reigning .ORG champion
*******************************************************
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 4:  Marasmus and Saynt Vr. Purple Haze and Jekel-Tag Championship
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny: well Mike sure is "weeding" out the inconsistent wrestlers tonight.

Barry: Nooooo...I never noticed...

Johnny: Well this next match is the one Saynt requested earlier tonight....
it's  tag match.

Barry: Not only is it a tag match but it's for the Tag Team championship....
and, another awesome thing about this match is it is identical twin vr.
identical twin.   

Johnny: I have just been told that these wrestlers don't have entrances, so 
they will walk to the ring, all business.

(((Saynt and Marasmus walk to the ring, the crowd can barely tell them 
apart)))

(((Jekel and Purple Haze walk to the ring, once again, the same thing, the
crowd can BARELY tell them apart.)))

Johnny: well here we are...let's go, tag team championships on the ling.

Marasmus and Purple Haze start out in the ring, they don't look tired from
their matches tonight basically because it was a slaughter for both of them.
Marasmus kicks Purple Haze in the stomack and does a fishermans suplex.  
Purple Haze gets up and doesa leg sweep.  Marasmus is on the ground.  Purple
Haze goes for the half Boston crab but Marasmus gets out of it.  Marasmus 
gets up and punches Purple Haze in the face, they exchange blows and 
Marasmus breaks the pattern by doing a dropkick, giving him time, he sprints
to the top rope and does a sunset flip.

Barry: If the cue card didn't tell me that was Marasmus I wouldn't know who
it was.

Purple Haze grabs his chest and Marasmus runs to the top ropes again. Purple
Haze crawls over and tags Jekel.  Marasmus does a flying clothesline but
Jekel moves out of the way and Marasmus falls face first onto the ground.
Jekel picks up Marasmus and does a fallaway slam.  Jekel lifts up Marasmus
and does a Samoen drop.  Marasmus rolls aroud on the ground, Jekel goes for
the pin: 1........2 and Marasmus kicks out.  Jekel goes to the top rope and
Saynt runs over and pushes Jekel off and onto the mat face first, Marasmus
crawls over and tags Saynt.  Saynt looks at Marasmus.

Barry: I didn't like the look of that...

Saynt then punches Marasmus in the face, he lands a DDT and goes to the top
rope and does a moonsault on Marasmus.  Marasmus can't beleive it.  Saynt
tags marasmus and kicks Marasmus into the center of the ring, where Jekel 
goes for the pin: 1...........2............3 and Jekel and Purple Haze keep
their titles and walk away.

Saynt: (Saynt grabs a mic and begins to talk) Listen Marasmus (who is still
lying on the ground) Once I found you, after my entire life of searching,
I got the info I needed, including my REAL last name.  From that I did some
research.  One thing led to another and I found out the truth.  Guess what I
found...it was no accident that I never found out who my mother and father
was...yes, that's right, I thought at least I had my father, well my father
wasn't my father, he was my kidnapper.  I was kidnapped when I was 2, mom
left my in my stroller as she went to look for you, that's right brother, if
YOU did not wander off mom would never have left me and I would never have
gotten kidnapped.  But you know what the icing was?  Mom looked for me for
less than a year...less than a year...you were I guess, good enough to make
up for both of us, so mom just gave up...she gave up on me.  That's it, I'm
out.
And the Winner is: Purple Haze and Jekel, the reigning Tag Team champions
*******************************************************

*While the ring announcer is announcing the main event, a 
man in blue jeans and a black t-shirt comes through the crowd. He 
enters thering, takes the mic, and pushes the anouncer down*
 
 I'm sure many of you are wondering just who I am and why I'm 
interupting the main event. First, don't worry about the (*gestuer " " marks) 
"main event". You're really not missing much. I mean, I've seen more 
flavor in a dish of gruel. I'm not too sure that most of you have the 
mental abliity to remember my name. Though I know that most of you are 
obviosly illiterate, I think you should write it down, because it is a name 
that you'll need to know. I am the New Model, and I've come to the OWF 
to show you gauking fools, who will belive anything that the people in 
back make up,  exactly what REAL wrestling is. I've seen the roster. 
I'm not impressed. I mean there's this idiot MaRaSmUs who can't go 
anywhere with out his little girlfriend okaying it first, and then holding 
his hand the whole time. The only person who meer name was of any intrest 
to me was David "Genocide" Cash. I said, " finnaly a guy who's wiping 
out the crowds that are comprised of overweight slobs, whose only 
concern is how far it is to the next McDonald!" Only to realize that he was 
just like the rest of them. Now, as much as I'd like to continue to 
educate "you all", I'm keeping several of the folks in the front row from 
an appointment with the Jerry Springer show. But one last thing, (* the 
New Model addresses the backstage area) This roster had better look 
out, because, their egos are about to be SLAMMED!! Now hit the music of 
the next OWF champ.!!

 *New Model no.15 hits and the New Model exits back through the crowd*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 6: Anarchy Vr. Shawn Matthews
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny: whoa, major part of Saynt's history has just been revealed folks.

Barry: Yeah, ok, this match is a non title match.

(((Mike walks to the ring)))

Johnny: Again?

Mike: Make that title match

Johnny: whoa

(((Mike leaves)))

Barry: Ok, this is a title match for the OWF 2000 world title.  SO here we 
go.

(((The arena goes black.  THen on the screen above the entrance the word
WARNING flashes in red.  Fireworks shoot straight up on each side of the
entrance and Danger Zone starts to play.  As the lights come on Shawn is
standing looking straight at the entrance.  He walks down the ramp to
the ring looking around the arena.  He slides underneath the ropes and 
spreads his arms wide open and turns 360 degrees around looking at the whole
entire arena.)))

(((The arena goes dark and the crowd goes quiet.  Starting at the bottom of
the ramp red lights start to go up slowly.  Ten sets of lights go to the
top, then a warning alarm goes of and the lights line up faster.  Then a big
explsion at the top of the ramp goes off and standing in the smoke is 
Anarchy as Stupified by disturbed plays and the lights stay come on in red.
He walks down th eramp and grabs onto the top rope and pulls himself up like
Kane.   He gets in the middle of the ring.  And he quickly raises his hands
in the air and the Kane pyro goes off.)))

Shawn Matthews runs at Anarchy and kicks him in the stomach.  Matthews goes
for a spinning neckbreaker and does is.  Anarchy hits the mat, Matthews 
picks him up and goes for a powerbomb, but as Anarchy is in the air Matthews
trys to finish it, but Anarchy turns it into a legs scissors and Matthews' 
head gets slammed into the mat.  Anarchy goes to the top ropes and trys to
do a moonsault, but Matthews gets up and pulls Anarchy down, throwing him
back first into the mat.  Anarchy gets up and Matthews throws him into the
ropes.  On the way back Matthews lands a back body drop.

Barry: Nice...

Johnny: Actually that was a very good technical-

Barry: Just shut up...I said shut up.

Johnny: ...

Matthews runs to the top ropes and does an elbow to stomach drop, Anarchy 
grabs his stomach.  Matthews goes back up to the ropes but Anarchy gets up,
Matthews is smart enough to get down before he hurts himself.  Matthews 
locks up with Anarchy.  The look to be fighting for next move, Anarchy 
finally overpowers Matthews and throws him to the turnbuckle.   Matthews 
falls down and Anarchy runs over and throws his entire body right at 
Matthews, who was lying in the corner.

Johnny: Good-

Barry: What did I tell you bra?

Johnny: Bra?  as in the womens underwear?

Barry: No!  Bra as in Brother, Brotha,  I really am sick of you.

Johnny: remember the days when I used to pick on you?

Barry: Yeah, those were the days before I whooped your ass in a Hell in a 
Cell...so shut up woman!

Anarchy sets up Matthews for a DDT off the top ropes and Matthews reverses
it into a superplex.  Matthews wobbles up and shakes it off and gets his 
energy back.  He goes to the top rope and does a double back flip and lands
it perfectly.  Anarchy coughs blood.  Matthews, almost out of energy, crawls
over to Anarchy and goes for the pin: 1......2........3 and that's it, 
Matthews retains his title.

Barry: there you go, your world title holder stays the same.

Johnny: Yeah, and-

Barry: just go home Johnny before I hurt you.

/End Saturday Night Surge

And the winner is: Shawn Matthews, the reigning WorldWW champion.
***************************************************************************

OOC: I want to say determining the winners of a match is a very very hard 
thing to do, alot of you do so well and are also against people who do so
well, it really is a hard thing for me to decide who wins, and if you give
me the chance, I normally will make up for you loosing if you have lost, but
wait it out, if you loose 4 times in a row I think you should talk to me, but
for real, this is really hard for me to do, I work my ass off writing these 
cards with no one elses help, so please don't overreact if you lost, we are
just here to have fun.

this goes for everyone, not just some people.

Cya,
Mike, Prez of OWF 2000
