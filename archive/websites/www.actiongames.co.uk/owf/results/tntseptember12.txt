!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(((This is the third show of the OWF 2000 and for the fans it 
hasn't become rutine one bit at all.  Day after day they yearn 
for more of the satisfying wrestling action that the OWF 2000 
provides them.  All the fans are getting geared up for Back in 
Business--the first Pay-Per-View but TNT is by no means a holdover
, it is exciting in it's own right.  Surge made the fans happy, 
and Taser should make them overjoyed.  They sit patiently in 
their seats, expecting Mike, which is what has happened these 
last 2 shows.  The lights go black.  Some fans even start 
chanting "Prez, Prez, Prez!"  But then Mike's music doesn't 
come on, instead it is Marasmus.)))

Marasmus: Listen up, Lizzy and I have several things we would 
like to talk about with you guys.  First off, let's start with 
Surge.  I did not and do not want to be known as the man who 
interferes in everyone's match, but last Saturday night is was 
necessary.  I needed to right what I did wrong with Purple Haze 
and I needed to get back at Bloodshed for what he said to my 
dear, dear Lizzy, ain't that right honey?  (Lizzy nods)  
Well tonight things are a little different.  I am paired up with 
Bloodshed.  Now listen Bloodshed, we have our differences, and 
those are meant to be settled at Back in Business, not here, not 
tonight.  If there is one thing I hate it is you, but if there is 
one thing that I hate more it is loosing a match I know I can win.  
So listen up Bloodshed, I don't want to loose this match here 
tonight, so you sure as hell better not screw this up.  For about 
20 minutes it will be you and me as close friends, when that bell 
rings and the ref holds up our wrists in the air we leave and go 
back to normal.  I know you are listening and I don't see why you 
wouldn't want this to happen too.  What a minute, what the!

(((The lights go black and then go really light, Angel is in the 
ring with Marasmus)))

Angel: Listen Marasmus, I have nothing against you yet, besides that 
thing you did to be initiated to that frat house when you were 22, 
but besides that, I have nothing against you, I think you got your 
two cents in and now it is time for me, so could you leave now?

Marasmus: (hesitantly) yeah, i'll leave, just remember what I said 
Bloodshed.

Angel: Thank you for your cooperation, goodbye Lizzy (nods like a 
gentleman and Lizzy curties back, while Marasmus pulls her away, 
in no way does this infer that Lizzy has taken a liking to Angel, 
they are merely being polite and mature)  Now listen, Last Saturday, 
at Surge, some things went down, and there are rumors about who it 
was in the stands, well listen, it was not him, who many people have 
suspected, it was a more normal persn than him, but I respect him 
and must obey to him.  Select wrestlers in this federation know 
about the man in the stands, and if you know him, you know to respect 
his wishes.  Now onto some other things, like tonight's match for 
the .COM title, well listen Bail, I don't care if I steal your gold, 
I am not a theif, I am a wrestler, and being a wrestler, and a good 
one matters more to me than a trifle to put on my waist, but I have 
come here to win.  Also, Valek, we will be in close proximity tonight,
too close for comfort for you I believe, but listen, stay away, the time 
is coming, Mike signed the contract.  So here, now,  I will announce 
that Mike, your sister is here, and my people are bringing her to you 
now, I am a man of my word and do not move, because she is on her way, 
I promise, I swear on the holy bible, now I need to go get ready for 
my match.

(((with a flash of light Angel is gone and the show is underway)))

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 1: Purple Haze Vr. Lightning: Cage Match
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barry: Whoa, that was quite an intro, not that I don't appreciate Mike, but it 
is good to see wrestlers talk a bit instead of just fight.

Johnny: Of course, and we all know how much you...appreciate Mike...and the 
wrestlers.  But anyways, last week there was an extremely dangerous roof match 
with these two opponents, and in my opinion, Lightning is a coward for 
rechallanging Purple Haze to a fight, I mean come on, take it like a man and 
admit he is better than you!

Barry: I disagree.

Johnny: Of course you do.

Barry: I think Lightning has a chance against Purple Haze and Lightning knows it,
 plus Marasmus did interfere in that rooftop match-

Johnny: Yeah, which should have been called a CEO office match.

Barry: yeah...well anyways, as you can see the cage is being lowered down to the
ring and they are about to get this thing going, this is a good match, because 
the cage promises no outside interferances.
Johnny: Yeah, well this one ought to be good.  Let's bring out the contestants!

(((The lights go out, Lightning strikes all 4 turnbuckles at the same time and 
Lightning's music plays.  Lightning walks out to the ring.)))

Johnny: Hold up, I just gotta comment on something here, theoratically lightning 
is composed of electrons.  Now electrons travel well through some surfaces and 
shitty through others.  Well unfortunately the cage set up out there is steel, 
and if I am not mistaken, steel is a conductor, which means no one should touch 
that steel.

Barry: Oh my god.

Johnny: What old man.

Barry: That has got to be the smartest thing you have ever said in your life.

Johnny: What...about the Old man thing?  No no, I know what you mean, I payed 
attention in my sience class unlike this guy Alec Lopez...big and strong, good 
with the ladies, while I sucked at everything.  Well LOOK AT ME NOW ALEC!  
LOOK AT ME FRICKIN NOW!  

Barry: Anything else?

Johnny: Yeah as a matter a fact, Alec, you are probably rollin the dubies in the 
back of a tire store while I am a major celebrity...ok mediocre celebrity...ok, 
find, so i am a quasi celebrity, but I am rich and that's all that matters.

(((Lightning finally makes his way to the ring, after going very slow, he opens 
the door and get's shocked and almost thrown backwards.)))

Johnny: Did I not warn him.

Barry: you didn't, you told me, he couldn't here.

Johnny: You know I wish you could just shut your lip!

Barry: whatever.

Johnny: Yeah, whatever, who are you...Cher...clueless...gay man, gay.

(((The arena becomes a hazy purple, the crowd goes nuts, Purple Hazes's music 
comes on and he walks out waving to the fans.  He walks to the cage and just 
before he grabs the door some firemen come out, spray down the cage, help lightning, 
and they get in the safe ring--or at least safe to the naked eye...)))

Barry: Finally.

Lightning attacks with a diving clothesline and lands it, and immediately goes for 
the cage.  Purple Haze grabs him and throws Lightning hard so his back hits the ground.  
Lightning gets up and trys to do a legsweep into a pin, except pinfalls don't count 
in this match, so he lets go right away, it dazed Purple Haze, but not to a big extent 
at all.

Johnny: What a retard.

Barry: That's "what a cognitive disabled" person.

Johnny: Dude, you have reached gay to new hieghts...

Lightning and Purple Haze exchange punch after punch, to see who can stay clear 
eyed the longest, think a boxing match with no gloves and rules, you have a good 
idea how 30 seconds of this was.  Finally Lightning drifts away and Purple Haze 
weakly lifts him up and runs his head into the side of the cage, again, again, 
again, aga- and Lightning slide down the back and throws  Purple Haze into the 
cage.  Lightning tries to climb the cage again, but is pulled back down by Purple.  
Purple runs to the top rope and does a 180 deegree lateral spin on Lightning who 
is on the ground and lands it perfectly, elbows into the ribcage and all, this move 
has never been executed so perfectly.

Johnny: Hell yes.

Barry: That is life threatening folks, his sternum could have been shoved into 
his aorta therefore making it extremely hard or impossible for Lightning to breathe.

Johnny: I say it was a good move, end of story. Period.  Ultimo.  

Barry: back into dumb mode I see.

Johnny: Listen old man, you best shut the hell up-wait a second, Purple Haze 
is at the top of the cage, he can win it right here, one foot- two feet, wait a second...
what the hell is he doing?

Purple Haze steps all the way to the top of the cage and looks down, he is about 30 feet 
up in the air.  He asks the crowd for approvel, the go apeshit.  He does a double backflip, 
but Lightning gets out of the way, and Purple Haze lands really bad.

Barry: I hate to see that happen.

Johnny: What?  I frigging love it.  It is quite a sight to see.

Lightning Pulls himself up and starts climbing the cage.  He gets one foot up and 
Purple Haze gets and jumps and grabs the remaining foot.  Lightning kicks Purple Haze 
in the nose and finishes the climb.  Lightning jumps down and looks at Purple Haze.  
They exchange evil looks.

Purple Haze: You know I had it one bitch, you know it.  Next time I won't be so nice 
to you.

Lightning: At least I am not an ass.

Purple Haze: What?  (looks to the fans)  Do you hear this shit? What do you think about 
this?  (crowd all boos)   That's what I thought.  Listen, next time I won't be nice at all.  
Period.  I'm out, someone open this damn door. 

(((By the time someone gets to the door Lightning is gone and Purple Haze is angry.))) 

And the Winner is: Lightning

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 2: Marasmus and Bloodshed Vr.  Shane Bishop and Angel
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barry: That last match was plain crazy.

Johnny: yeah, but it was one of the best I have seen in a hella long time.  Whoa, 
here comes Marasmus.

(((Marasmus just walks out, tells Lizzy to go sit by the announcers and gets into 
the ring)))

Marasmus: Listen.  It seems we have a bit of a problem here.  Shane Bishop won't 
fight.  He doesn't "do" tag matches.  First off, this isn't a tag match, it is 2 on 
2 in the same ring all at once.  So what is the big deal.
Plus, I haven't seen Bloodshed all night, so I don't know what the hell is going 
on with him.

(((Shane Bishop walks out to the side of the ring with a mic and looks up at 
Marasmus)))

Shane Bishop: Listen man, I don't want this match, I don't do these matches.

(((Bloodshed walks out to the the ring and into it.  Bloodshed and Marasmus 
exchange nods, this in no way implies that they are friends, they are putting 
thier fued on hold to help each other, something that shows lots of maturity)))

Bloodshed: You don't wanna fight?  Well I got one thing to say to that bitch: 
Hells no.   You are gonna fight.  Pretend Marasmus and Angel aren't in the ring, 
it'll be you and me, 1 on 1.  Are you going to do it...or are you scared?

(((On the THX screen Kirk Storm appears)))

Kirk Storm: Dude, fucking do it, I don't have a match...I'll do it if you won't.

Bloodshed: Oh hells no you won't I want this bitch, now bring it!

Bloodshed runs at Shane Bishop and starts the fight.  He drags Bishop into the 
ring.  A light flashes, Angel is in the ring.  Bloodshed is still angry at Angel 
for calling him gay.  Bloodshed throws Bishop to Marasmus and takes on Angel. 

Bishop does a drop kick to Marasmus and then runs away.

(((Backstage, Bishop runs out and runs into Mike)))

Mike: Dude, man, what are you doin?

Bishop: I told you I wouldn't do it.

Mike: Listen man, I looked over your contract, you are right, you didn't agree to
tag teams, I am sorry for booking the match.

Bishop: You better be.

Mike: Now listen, Saturday I will book you a one on one match against anyone you want
just get back to me on it, I need to go sort this out, the stuff I started myself.

(((Mike runs out)))

Johnny: Heeeeeeeerrrrre's Mikey.

Barry: isn't it supposed to be here's Johnny?

Johnny: When Mike gets here you better shut the hell up, I'll do all the talking.

Mike: What's up guys.

Johnny: Nothing Mike, how's it going.

Mike: Well I just releived Bishop of this match, and he gets any fight he wants next 
Saturday.

Johnny: Cool, but what about this shit?

Mike: Let's let this keep going for however long they want...hey let's get some refs out
here.

(((refs run out to the ring to ref the match.)))

Marasmus throws Angel into the ropes, and gets down on his hands and knees.  Bloodshed
uses Marasmus as a launch pad and does a flip in the air and slams into Angel.  
Marasmus grabs Angel's head and goes to the top rope and does a spinning DDT off the top
rope.

Johnny: Nice teamwork, I gotta hand it to these guys.

Barry: They are bitter rivals too.

Bloodshed goes and picks up Angel and goes for the Powerbomb, Marasmus comes over and 
helps Bloodshed do the sitting powerbomb on Angel.  Angel is pretty much out cold.
Marasmus does a leg drop on Angel and Bloodshed goes for the pin.  1.....2.....3
Marasmus and Bloodshed won.  The nod at each other coldly and walk out of the ring
in opposite directions.

Barry: Well that was wierd, really weird.

Johnny: Yeah, I never thought those two could work together so well...

And the Winner is:  Bloodshed and Marasmus 
********************************************************

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 3: Valek Vr. Piranha (.ORG not on the line, I think Valek has defended it
enough for now seeing as it has been 2 defends in 2 cards:)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barry: Well this has been a great night, but I just wanna move on to the next
match.

Johnny: Why, so you can see your lover Piranha.

Barry: Hey, I happen to know for a fact that Piranha is straight.

Johnny: what and you aren't sure if you are?

Barry: you know what I mean.  

Johnny: Or do I?

Barry: Look here comes Valek.

Johnny: Saved by the fuckin bell.

(((Spiders by system of a down comes on.  Spotlights fly around the arena and 
center on Valek.  Valek walks to the ring awaiting Piranha.  As soon as the 
lights come on Piranha sprints to the ring.)))

Piranha dives at Valek but Valek grabs him in midair and turns it into a swinging
powerbomb.  Valek goes for the early pin but Piranha gets out immediately.  
Piranha gets up and punches Valek a few times, Valek grabs Piranha's arm and 
throws Piranha to the ground.  Valek does a leg drop on Piranha and goes for the
pin.  Piranha gets out again.  

Barry: Valek hasn't beaten up Piranha enough yet...I don't know why he keeps 
going for the pin.  

Valek lifts up Piranha and thros him into the ropes, on Piranha's way back 
Piranha dives between Valek's legs and throws him down.  Piranha get's up and 
does a small flip on Valek's chest.  Piranha gets up and goes for an elbow drop,
and lands it in the chest.  Piranha goes to the top rope and looks to the crowd.
The crowd cheers.  Piranha goes for a diving headbutt but Valek get's out of the
way.

Barry: Now would be the time for the pin if any.

Valek walks around and looks to the audience, he sees someone up in the top of
the audience.  He gets an agngry face and lifts up Piranha.  Valek just circles
Piranha.  Piranha does a diving clothesline and Valek falls to the gound.
Piranha goes to the top rope and does a moonsault, lands it perfectly.  Piranha
goes for the pin: 1.......2.......................3.  Piranha wins.

Johnny: WTF!  This is the second Piranha Match in a row where Piranha's opponent
gives up when he could win!  There is someone in the audience Pissing off 
Johnny-no-good.

Barry: I hate it when you talk in third person.

Johnny: Yeah!  yeah!  well I hate you, so shut the hell up you Chinese whore!

And the Winner is: Piranha

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 4: Bail Vr. Crossbones Vr. Darklander - For the .COM championship.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barry: During the commercial Bail and Darklander made their way to the arena.
I would like to say that Rice a Roni truly is the San Fransisco Treat, I have
tried other Ronis, and Rice a is by far the most Fransican.

Johnny: dude, that sucked man.

Barry: I read from the cards, you know that.

Johnny: whatever....doesn't Fransican mean a clergy member or something?  retard.

Barry: Come on man, give me a break!

Johnny: Ahaha, NEVER! 

The lights go out.  People expect Crossbones, but then the lights go back on, there
is a little candle in the middle of the ring lit.  Darklander and Bail go over
to inspect it.  Crossbones runs out and looks at the candle, he gets angry and
throws it away.

Johnny: Who's the gay ass that put a candle in the middle of the ring?

Barry: I don't know.

Johnny: it was probably your gay ass, you idiot.  

Barry: (sarcastically) yeah, it was me, you caught me.

Johnny: watch it old man.

Crossbones is angry and little skirmishes break out in the ring.  

Barry: I would like to take this opportunity to say the rules of this match.  It is
triple threat--OWF 2000 style.  If you are thrown out of the ring you are out, and
first pin wins.  Even if you aren't the one pinned you can still loose.

Crossbones thows Darklander into Bail.  Bail and Darklander start fighting.  Bail 
goes for a body slam and gets it.  He backs up and Crossbones does a superman
off the top rope right onto Darklander and goes for the pin, but Bail rips off
Crossbones.  Bail goes for the pin, but Crossbones grabs bail off of Darklander. 
Crossbones goes for the pin, Bail pulls him off and goes on.

Johnny: How sad, two grown men competing for a half dead carcass.

Barry: He isn't half dead, you are exaggurating.

Johnny: I know you retard.

Crossbones grabs Bail, and Bail is expecting what Crossbones did that last 
two times.  But instead Crossbones throws Bail right outside the ring.

Johnny: haha, there goes Bail.

Darklander after haveing that nice rest gets up.  Darklander locks up with
Crossbones, Crossbones goes for a suplex but Darklander stops it and does
his own Vertical Suplex on Crossbones.  Darklander goes for the pin:
1.........2............and Crossbones gets up right in the amount of time.
Crossbones locks up with Darklander again and does a leg sweep.  Darklander
looks dazed.  Crossbones goes to the top rope and does a diving elbow
drop.  Darklander is grabbing his chest in pain.  

Johnny: owch, i love it.

Crossbones throws away Darklanders hands and jumps on Darklanders chest.
The pain knocks out Darklander. 1.......2...........3 and Crossbones is
the new .COM champion!

Barry: The funny thing about that match was that Bail was the first one
out and he was the title holder, so the remainder of the match we were
watching 2 people compete for another mans title.

Johnny: Yeah, hillarious...oh god, my spleen, my spleen.

Barry: Well anyways, that was tonights show, once again I don't think 
Mike has dissapointed us...we'll see you all next Saturday at Surge, until 
then, good fight-

Johnny: Don't say it man.

Barry: Good night.

Johnny: God man, you are the dumbest man I have ever met.

Barry: Good bye folks, cya Saturday!

And the Winner is: Crossbones
