***Sorry for the shitty results, things are crazy after the PPV...you'll
get a better card saturday.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(((The crowd, amazed at what was truly one of the greatest events in the 
history of wrestling is sitting in their coveted seat in the Minniapolis
arena in Minisota.  The Pay Per View shocked everyone, from the debut of the
Vice Prez, to the amazing highly anticipated Deathmatch between Marasmus and
Bloodshed, in which a new family member of Marasmus' was revealed--a twin
brother.  To another family member reavealed at the Crossbones/Skull match...
it was a family reunion, with father, and sons, in the ring.  To the world
title match between Shawn Matthews and Purple Haze, where the crowd pleaser 
lost to the mean, arrogent heel, and to the Crag/Tokyo match, where two
rookies truly did show their abilities in the ring.   There was dissapoint
ment too, when the good guys won against Night Crawler, but Angel, who many
people thought, hoped, would return, didn't.  All in all, it truly was a 
night to remember...here in the OWF.  

Finally the lights dim and Mike makes his way to the arena.)))

Mike: Welcome one, Welcome ALL!  This is Tuesday Night Taser.  As you can
see we don't have tons of matches for tonight, but we do have enough to 
satisfy your OWF cravings!  We gots your Mark Blaze Vr. Crossbones and we
gots your Dirty Russian Vr. Scotty Hinton!  Plus, tonight, 5 people will 
inch closer to a shot at the World title as 5 people risk getting farther 
apart!  That is right, one of the most HIGHLY anticipated spectacles in the
OWF yet, OWF SURVIVOR kicks off tonight!  What we got here is 10 members of
the federation who will compete against and with each other for the ultimate
reward of the World Title.  I have no clue who will win it, it is up to the 
wrestlers themselves.  This will involve street smarts, intelligence, cunning
outwitting, and tons of lying...that is right, what will go down here will
turn out to be TONS of lying...people here will do whatever they can to get 
a shot at the coveted world title.  Well now is the time where I will 
announce the 10 men that will be involved in OWF Survivor, one of which will
get a world title shot and a mystery suprise...this is a great chance, a 1 
in 10 chance at a world title shot and a mystery prize...here they are:

Team 1:        Team 2:
Crossbones     Night Crawler
Mark Blaze     Mr. Tokyo
Marasmus       Crag
Saynt          Dirty Russian
Bloodshed      Arch Angel

Mike...Ahhh wtf...lets add some more.

Team 1:        Team 2:
----------     -------------
Crossbones     Night Crawler
Mark Blaze     Mr. Tokyo
Marasmus       Crag
Saynt          Dirty Russian
Bloodshed      Arch Angel
Lowell Dotcom  Purple Haze
Scotty Hintman Shady
               Bungalow Bill
----------------------------
Mike: There you have it...the teams...wait...what...I need one more...hmmmm
who should that be...I know, how about Geno-

Voice: Cut the shit.  

Mike Looks around...all over the arena.

Voice: I'm gonna be the 18th man...and I'm gonna be the last man too.

Mike: Who the hell are you and why do you think you get a spot?
 
Voice: Because I deserve it...and the prize was supposed to be mine Sunday.

Mike: What the fuck!

(((Angel's music comes on and Angel walks to the ring, everyone in the crowd
goes apeshit and a few windows break because of the noise)))

Mike: What the hell! How the hell!  We all saw you!

Angel: ahhh, Mike, but you didnt' see me...that camera angle sucked, no 
details could be shown that far away...I knew enough about people to know 
the minute they thought I died they would take away the camera from me, and
I knew enough about you that you, Mike, Can't stand to look at a dead body...
ahhh you know all too well you can't stand to look at a dead body.  You 
threw that sheet over that mutilated corpse without even looking...how do I
know you didn't look?  Because I had the person's name written on his neck,
but you didnt' look, and the people at the hospital had no clue what it 
meant, only you would know, but that person is buried now, in the grave, my
grave...the one Night Crawler so gractiously remodeled for me.  You see Mike,
what happened was me and Arch Angel were in on this since before the match,
when camera angles switched we took this "substitute" and threw him over
the rafters, that simple, and don't get me started on the cameras that were 
up there, they were so easily payed off it isn't worth noting, and if they
wouldn't accept money we could kick their asses, so either way, we won.  Why
you ask?  Why would I take away a world title shot from myself?  Simple.  
For the main reason, as I have said, I am not in this for the world title, 
or a belt, I am in this to do...human experimenting, and my first experiment
gave me data to last a life time.  Everyone did what I thought they would do.
Arch Angel started the pattern by crying about me, then soon after, everyone
followed, the stupidity of humans astounds me.  Then there were the few that
chose to say fuck him i never knew you so I don't care.  Night Crawler, you
happened to take that role.  Whether I know if it was for you to act tough
or for you to just have a feeling I would come back I don't know, but I 
beleive it is just because you want to feel like a badd ass.  Well everyone,
Angel is back!  Angel is here to stay, and I hope you all realize that when
I'm gone, you miss me.  Mike, I'm out, write me in for that Match, Angel's 
back in the ring tonight.

(((Angel's music plays and he leaves the arena, everyone is going wild)))

Mike: Well folks, Angel played our asses...I would be happy and shake his 
hand, if I only knew who he threw off the rafters...

****************************************
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 1: Crossbones Vr. Mark Blaze
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(((the lights go out...Mike walks back to the ring)))

Mike: Listen folks, Crossbones is really messed up from his inferno match and
apparently there was some SERIOUS miscommunication between me and Mark Blaze
as to if they wanted this match or not...so tonight there will be no Mark Blaze
Crossbones match, but if you came to See Blaze, check Saturday, where he will
be fighting Marasmus for the .ORG belt.

OOC: There really was miscommunication between me and Blaze

And the Winner is: No one

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 2: Scotty Hinton Vr. Dirty Russian
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(((Cut to a shot of Johnny No Good and Barry Barlett in slings and neck 
braces after Sunday's match between the two in a hell in a cell)))

Johnny: Well ain't that some shit...Angel truly did play everyone, even, from
what it seems, Bloodshed, Angel's first friend in this fed.  My only regret
is that I didn't clearly see whose face it was.

Barry: Cut the crap, the head was looking right at us, you were afraid to 
look.

Johnny: Well you did't look either.

Barry: But I don't make excuses.

Johnny: Look, just because you got lucky in a Hell in a Cell match Sunday...

Barry: Luck!  Ha!  you wanna go again!

Johnny: Look, just shut up, lets go back to the way things were before all
this.

Barry: What, you making fun of me?

Johnny: Yes!

Barry: Well in that case f--- you!

(((Dirty Russian's music comes on and Dirty Russian makes his way to the 
ring)))

(((Scotty Hinton's music comes on and Scotty Hinton makes his way to the 
ring)))

Johnny: uhh sorry folks, we are having temporary technical difficulties, 
which is why only music for the past two wrestlers came on with no flashy
intros.

Barry: Yeah, that sucks too, mainly because this is their first match and
they don't get a proper intro...oh well...next time, well here we go, on to
the match!

Dirty Russian charges Scotty Hinton and dives between his legs.  Dirty 
Russian quickly gets up and does a reverse DDT.  Scotty Hinton gets up and 
grabs Dirty Russian.

Barry: Gee Johnny, I'll bet you would like to be in Hinton's position...a big,
masculine, russian man...does that make you horny?

Johnny: ugh. that's sick man.

Hinton does a vertical suplex and Dirty Russian flys back up for a few seconds,
then falls right back down.  Hinton goes to the top rope and goes for a 
moonsault.  On his way down Russian quickly gets up and grabs Hinton and does a
body slam hard into the mat.  Russian picks up Hinton and throws him into the
ropes.  Hinton comes back, Russian Attempts a back body drop, and does it, but
in the air Hinton does a full flip and lands on his feet.  Russian turns around
and Hinton kicks him in the face.  

Johnny: Nice move.

barry: Your mamma's nice.

Johnny: Lame man...lame.

Hinton goes  to the top rope and does a frog splash.  He lands it perfect.  He
runs to the ringside to grab something, he grabs a canadian and russian flag.
He takes a piss on the russian flag and runs over and puts it on top of Dirty
Russian.  He goes for the pin with his foot: 1.........2...........3.  He then
runs to the ringside and grabs the canadian flag.  He goes to the top rope and
does a flip with the flag on his chest, he lands it, lays the flag over Russian
and walks away.

Johnny: Harsh...
And the Winner is:  Scotty Hinton
********************************************************

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 3: Survivor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny: Ok, here we go...from what it looks like it is something like 18 men in
this match...survivor.  It's a 5 minute match, so it ain't gonna be that long.
As you can see, a few people will NOT be participating TONIGHT.  If the members
of the loosing team choose to vote them out... i don't know...we can only watch 
and see what happens.

Barry: Right now everyone is watching how gay you are.

Johnny: Just shut the hell up.

Team one walks to the ring...they sort of talk like they are making last minute 
plans on what they should do...strategys and stuff.

Johnny: Looks like they are making strategys.

Barry: nooooooooooo? really?

Team two walks to the ring Team one immidiately charges them.  Right away two
things are noticed, one, which people knew, is that the teams are each short
one person, except for team one, which is missing Angel.  The second thing that
is noticed is the fact that friends are staying away from each other...for example,
Dirty Russian and Bloodshed steer clear of each other...Dirty Russian finds someone
else to fight with, but Bloodshed looks around, not knowing who to fight.

Dirty Russian looks immidiatly for Hinton, who earlier humiliated him.  He finds him
from the back and gives him an elbow from the back.  He slams him to the ground and
punches with closed fists, there are so many people in the ring the refs couldn't see
so he goes for the pin: 1.......2..........3.

Johnny: that's 1.

All of a sudden there is a flash and Angel is hanging from ropes about fifty feet 
above the ring.  He lets go of the rope and falls to the ground, he tumbles a bit,
but Bloodshed helps him up.

Bloodshed: Good to see you back motha.

They shake hands and charge Night Crawler with a double clothesline.  They land it.
Bloodshed holds Night Crawler in place as Angel goes to the top rope and preforms
"from the heavens" a 360 deegree backflip and a half.  He lands it perfect and 
Bloodshed goes for the pin as Angel goes for the next victim.  1.......2.........3.

Barry: 1 to 1

Marasmus is fighting Crag.  Angel runs over from behind and does a reverse suplex
on Crag.  Marasmus nods in approval and goes for the pin: 1........2........3.

Barry: 1 to 2

Arch Angel is fighting Lowell Dotcom.  Lowell does a hurricaneranna and goes for the
pin: 1..........2.......and Arch Angel jumps out.  Angel runs by, looks, and runs 
to another person.  Lowell does a body slam and goes for the pin, as Dirty Russian comes
over to help: 1......2.........3

Barry: 2 to 2.

Purple Haze and Mark Blaze are fighting.  Purple Haze does a roundhouse kick and 
goes for a suplex, lands it.1.......2..........3

Barry: 3 to 2...two minutes left.

Saynt and Shady are fighting.  Saynt goes for a leg sweep.  Bloodshed runs over
and looks like he wants to punch Saynt...but lets it by and they do a double
suplex on Shady: 1..........2..............3

Barry: 4 to 2...one and a half minutes left.

Crag and Lowell are going at it now....Crag does a quick leg sweep pin, 1.........2.....
3.

Barry: 4 to 2......one minute left.

ANgel runs over to Crag, who had just finished his pin and does a leg drop on him.
Bloodshed runs over and does a flip onto Crag.  Angel holds the elbows with his 
hands as Bloodshed does the pin: 1......2..........3

Johnny: There it is.  Team one wins.

And the Winner is: Team 1
