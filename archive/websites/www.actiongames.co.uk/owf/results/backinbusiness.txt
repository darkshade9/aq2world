****************************************
(((Milwaukee Wisconsin, the Bradly Center.  This is where people have been
outside of for the past week, awaiting a small chance they can buy scalped 
tickets or maybe someone will cancel--yeah right.  But after a long, long 
time, through thick and thin, the OWF finally has their first Pay Per View,
Back In Business, get ready...right now)))

(((Mike walks to the ring and the crowd absolutely goes nuts...this isn't
some lame Vince McMahon cop out, this is a prez that makes the people happy.
and they always trust him...or most of the time.)))

Mike: Welcome everyone!  Well beleive it or not, I don't have much to say.
Actually I just want to say somethihng and introduce someone, hey dude, come
to the ring!

(((A man walks to the ringside)))

Mike: Everyone, this is Blaze, he is taking the VP position...I have negotiated
with him the past two weeks, he has showed me what he has done, and he has 
brung in new members.  He is doing things and unfortuanatly no one sees them,
and if you do see them, you don't know it was he who did it.  Eveyone welcome
Blaze.  (((the crowd cheers))) Ok Blaze, you can go finish. (((Blaze walks 
away)))

Mike: Now, Tuesday...there will be a card on time, it will be a smaller card,
but there is significance to it.  On Tuesday I will not only be revealing the
teams for OWF Survivor, but we will be having the first match for Survivor!
Now 10 members will be involved in the game, and the first match will be a
5555 match.  5 on 5 for 5 minutes or the first team with 5 pins wins.  Now 
this match will set the standard, not all matches will be like this, sometimes
there will be representitives for the team, maybe one, two or three, you'll
see as the game progresses, but remember, it's a game, but the prize is a 
world title shot and a mystery prize...if you loose it doesn't matther 
though, because you ARE NOT out of the fed.  But enought about Tuesday...lets
get onto NOW!

(((Fireworks go nuts and Mike leaves the ring)))
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 1: Barry Barlett Vr. Johnny No Good (Commentators) Hell in a Cell
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(((The first match of the night is about to go underway, ironicly it 
involves no actual contracted wrestler from the OWF, but none other than--
our beloved Rinside Color Commentators Johnny No Good and Barry Barlett.  It
is a hell in a cell match that Barry Barlett challenged Johnny No Good to
after No Good had pissed off Barlett too much with the gay jokes all aimed
at Barry)))

Mike: So go figure, the two ringside announcers are wrestling.  Nooo this 
company can't go out and hire some temporary "jobber" commentators, they
get me, the Prez, to come here and do this, ah well, it's all fun anyways.
Well let's get this started!

(((Highlights of Barry Barlett's past commentation experiences show up on
the Online-Tron.  Michael Jackson's You are not Alone come on the
loudspeakers.  Barry, annoyed, flicks off the tech room and the music 
changes to Stan by Eminem.)))

Mike: gotta love that song...that dude is nuts man...he was also gay...I 
wonder if Barry knows that...Well I want everyone to note that the OWF 
firmly supports Napster, we encourage everyone to go download Eminem's song
"Stan" right now.  It will be his next music video, so that means you have
an opportunity to get ahead by selling burnt copies, because that's what 
Napster is all about, sharing.  Sharing for money.  Ok, so it's piracy, but
it is soooo easy it doesn't seem like piracy...

(((Highlights of Johnny No Good's past commentation experiences come on and
Johnny walks to the ring, with tons of boos.  He flicks em off and waves to
Mike.  Mike rolls his eyes.  Kid Rock's Bawitdaba comes on and Johnny dances
but to onlookers it looks like an epileptic seisure.)))

Mike: There he is, suck up, and bad commentator, but gets ratings, THQ makes
me keep him around...

Both wrestlers step inside the hell in a cell.

Mike: You know, WTF, let's throw in tacs, that's what Barry wanted.

Mike throws tacs into the ring, it kind of appears as if he is throwing the
tacs at Barry...only Mike knows.  Barry and Johnny circle each other, Johnny
dives a Barry, but Barry stops Johnny and shoves is face into the tacs, 
instant blood.  Barry gets on top of Johnny and punches him repetivily in 
the face, closed fist.

Mike: Don't expect much more than a body slam from these guys...they can't
exactly do much...I'll allow closed fists, just this once though...Hey ref!
Closed fists allowed!

Johnny grabs Barry's fist and throws Barry to the ground, Barry's back lands
on the tacs, Barry shows pain.  Johnny starts doing the same thing Bary did.

Mike: Hey ref, changed my mind, no closed fists.

The ref makes Johnny let go.  Johnny looks to Mike, as if assuring Mike that
Johnny isn't mad, Mike rolls his eyes, because he could care less if Johnny
was mad.  Barry goes for a spear on Johnny, but Johnny turns it onto a rough
DDT.

Mike: Gotta hand it to the guy...but that is the best you will see all night
I promise.

Johnny raises his arms for approval from the audience, but gets boos instead
and chants rooting for Barry to win.  Johnny gets angry and starts climbing 
the side, which won't do him much help basically because there is a chain 
roof on the top.  Johnny grabs the chain roof, he dangles 10 feet above the 
ground hanging on to that chain fence roof.  Finally, a 5x5 square foot
part of it falls off as Johnny Falls down with it.  Johnny landed fence
first, and his fingers were still in the chain, so he broke his fingers and
hit his head against the chain fence, the crowd goes wild.

MIke; Daaaamn, these are just commentators, they really care about this!

Barry gets up and the fans are on their feet cheering like a vietnamese 
whore house (Past or Present...nothing has changed there...)  Barry walks 
over to Johnny, grabs the chain fence out of Johnny's broken fingers, and
lays it on top of him.  Barry goes to the top of the 25 foot Cell and goes
through the 5x5 foot opening that Johnny paved the way for earlier.  Barry
jumps all the way down into a frog splash, both men are equally hut, 
Johnny a little more.  The crowd is absolutely going wild.

Mike: Uh-Oh...how do I top a pop like that later tonight...

The ref starts the count: 1......2.......3.......4........5........6......7-
Barry puts his arm on Johnny: 1.....2......Johnny puts his arm on Barry,
Barry shoves it off, and puts his on the entirly out of it Johnny-1........
2..........3 and Barry wins the match, and the crowd couldn't have been
any happier.

Mike: Good job guys, better than I expected...uh oh...they need to go to the
hospital...aka I need to stay here all night....nooooooooooo, I will not
survive.

And the Winner is: Barry Barlett
********************************************************

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 2: Crag Vr. Mr. Tokyo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike: These guys are two newcomers to the OWF, but are definately PPV 
material...if you have heard them talk you know that they are two pretty
idealistic guys.  Crag, America's man...and Tokyo...quite the opposite...
the man from Japan...or whatever...ok, I'm gonna get sued for that last 
comment, so I'd better move on...

(((The lights go out, the usual red white and blue pyro happens and water
rockets shoot out into the audince, getting a little laugh from most kids)))

Mike: That's crag for you...fan favorite if there is one.

(((The arena goes dark and the crowd starts to buzz about what is coming.
Smoke fills the entrance way and the beginning of "The house of the Rising
Sun" starts but is scratched off and "Fight Fire with Fire" starts pumping 
over the speakers.  Mr. Tokyo's entrance video plays over the Jumbotron. Mr.
Tokyo walks through the smoke and to the ring with a deadly serious look on
his face.  He waists no time rolling into the ring, He takes a vial from his
tights and sips.  He shoots a grey mist all over the ring, and onto an 
American flag that someone in the audience is holding...the crowd boos and a 
beer can barely missed him.)))

Crag sees what Tokyo just did and charges him with a spear...one of the 
normal starts of a match.  Tokyo gets up and looks to the crowd, they all
boo crazily.  Tokyo sighs it off and locks up with Crag and throws him to 
the ground and puts him in a complex leglock named the Tokyo Flow.  It's a 
figure 4 upside down and bent in a weird way...either way, the louder Crag
screams in pain the louder the crowd boos for Tokyo.  Crag squints at the
pain and crawls to the ropes and Tokyo lets go.  Crag gets up and grabs 
Tokyo and goes for a powerbomb...with Tokyo weighing 235 pounds that is a 
big accomplishment.

Mike: These guys are really good technical wrestlers...watch for more and 
more good moves as their careers progress in the OWF.

The crowd cheers a ton as Crag goes to the top rope and asks for cheers, and
receives it overwhelmingly.

Mike: You see, I knew Crag could wrestle, but I had no clue the crowd would
embrace him as they have.

Crag goes for a frog splash but Tokyo gets out of the way.  Crag lands hard
on his chin.  Tokyo gets up and grabs Crag's head and lifts him up.  He does
grabs Crag's chin and does a neckbreaker.  The crowd boos and even throws
their cans into the ring at Tokyo.  Crag is laying right next to a huge 
puddle of blood left from the previous match.  Tokyo lifts Crag up and goes
for the Rising sun, but Crag does a leg sweep and grabs the ankle of Tokyo
and slams the knee of Tokyo into the mat.

Mike: The crowd here must be going nuts, but somewhere in japan people are
booing...

Crag turns him over and goes for a bosten crab.  He locks it in, but it
was very near the ropes and Tokyo grabs the ropes with not much trouble.  
Crag lets go and when Tokyo gets up he kicks him in the face, making Tokyo
go to the turnbuckle.  Crag grabs Tokyo's neck and climbs to the top rope 
and does a flip while holding the neck of Tokyo.

Mike: Nice Bagwell Blockbuster variation...

Crag goes to the top rope, this time not wasting time to get cheers from the
audience and just does a flip and goes straight into the pin: 1.....2.....
and Tokyo gets out.  Tokyo, with a newfound momentum, body slams Crag.  Crag
gets up and dives between Tokyo's legs and does a back body drop and goes
to the second turnbuckle and jumps to the top ropes and bounces into a back
flip onto Tokyo.  He gets up and runs back to the top rope for another shot
but Tokyo gets back up and runs over to try and stop Crag, but Crag grabs 
him and does a jumping piledriver onto Tokyo from the top rope.

Mike: there you have it folks, one of the most dangerous and barely legal 
moves allowed--the Point of No return...by Crag...

Tokyo grabs his neck as if it is broken, the ref goes over to inspect it...
Crag looks annoyed that he could have the pin right now.

Mike: Uh oh...i was hoping this wouldn't happen...ok, commentator mode, not
prez mode...

The "Impecable Scotty Hinton" runs to the ring with a chair and hits Crag in
the head. Tokyo really did hurt his neck and can't barely move.

Scotty: (saying to crag) well Crag, you have been blessed with the 
opportunity to stand in the ring with the two best products to come out of
Japan since the playstation...looks like two foreigners got the best of you.

The crowd is going nuts and Scotty runs away.  Tokyo really did hurt his 
neck and is really weak, but so is Crag...but Crag has the audience, who is
screaming for Crag to get up.  Crag crawls over to Tokyo, dripping blood on
Tokyo: 1........2.....3 and Crag, the American dream to many, wins the 
match.

Mike: ok...the interference didn't do much but daze Crag...although Crag 
will still be pissed...next match please...ok guys, the next one is on a 
more serious note...
And the Winner is:  Crag
********************************************************

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 3: Marasmus Vr. Bloodshed, Deathmatch
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike: As you have heard, this next match is the match that has been booked 
the longest and will be fought the way it was intended...As the faithful 
fans of the OWF may know, Bloodshed, with the recent death of Angel, has 
introduced a "mystery man" Now you may remember Angel introduced "him" or 
"he" but never said who it was...could this new mystery man be the same 
person and Bloodshed is meant to carry out what Angel didn't???

(((Smoke fills the arena.  Jail bars open on the Online-Tron and Bloodshed
walks out.  He walks up to the ring, flicking off any of the booing crowd.  
He spits in the middle of the ring, looks at Mike and sort of gives a bring
it on sign.)))

Mike: Yeah, Yeah, I'm scared...just remember how you got here...

(((The lights go out and then the eerie red light fills the ring and 
enterace way.  The music plays and the red mist fills up by the curtains 
leading from the backstage to the arena.  A womanly figure steps through
the mist and stops.  When she stops Marasmus comes out in perfect tune with
the music.  They make theirway to the ring, Marasmus goes betwen the ropes
as Lizzy uses the steps.  Marasmus then lifts the bottom rope for lizzy and
she bends all the weay over and under, Much to the delight of the male 
audience)))

Mike: they just love lizzy...hey, remind me to fire these cue guys sometime.
Well anyways, this is a deathmatch aka that is real barbed wire you see 
wrapped around the ropes...good thing the ropes are red...if they were white
they would be red with blood after this match...Also notice the tables, with
-duh duh duuummmmmm- Splinters all over them...then there is the poles, the
wooden planks, the baseball bats, the handcuffs, the classic tacs, wait a 
sec...get those out of there...Marasmus wanted a real deathmatch, put some
nails in there.  Any ways...lets get this on with...ding ding ding...hey...
the prez says ding ding ding

The bell rings and Bloodshed and Marasmus stare at each other.  The longest
anticipated match has finally come.  It is finally happening, right here, 
right now.  The realize the heat of the moment, stop a little to fully grasp
it and run for a weapon.  Bloodshed grabs a wooden bat and Marasmus grabs a
pole.  Bloodshed goes for a shot to the head, but Marasmus blocks it.  
Bloodshed goes for another shot to the torso, but Marasmus doesn't just 
block the bat, he swings his pole at the bat, thus breaking it apart.  He
then hits Bloodshed mercessly in the back, thus making Bloodshed immidiately
hit the ground.

Mike: That hit was sadistic...you know that this isn't the first time these
guys have been in the ring together?  They one were on the same team and 
beat the hell out of Angel...they really worked well together also.

Marasmus hits Bloodshed a few more times, Bloodshed is bleeding all over.  
Marasmus turns his back and walks over to grab some tacks.  He takes a bag 
and sets it on Bloodshed's chest.  Marasmus grabs a chair and hits Bloodshed
in the chest with it, making all the tacks stick into Bloodshed's chest.
Bloodshed coughs blood and grabs his chest.  He looks up, angry.  Marasmus
goes for a ladder and a few tables.  Bloodshed lays there, in pain, while
Marasmus sets things up.

Mike: When Bloodshed lays there for so long, you know that something is 
wrong...but he will finish the match one way or another.  

Marasmus gets some tables and sets one up in the corner of the ring, and
near the opposite corner he sets up a ladder.  He takes some nails and 
sets them under the table in the corner.  He takes another table and puts it
in the middle of the ring.  Bloodshed starts to get up, he uses a pole to 
help himeslf get up.  He gets up and gets a new wind.  Marasmus starts to 
climb the ladder, but Bloodshed runs to it and shoves it to the side.  
Marasmus falls to the side into the barb wire, and it starts electicuting 
him.  His arms is wrapped in the electrically charged barbed wire.

Mike: Oh yeah, Marasmus wanted the barbed wire to be charged with low 
voltage electricity... he had it coming.

Lizzy screams at the sight of seeing Marasmus being electricuted.  Marasmus
rips off the barbed wire, leaving a burnt, cut up wrist.  Bloodshed charges
Marasmus with a chair, knocking him out.  Bloodshed hits him again with the
chair and drags Marasmus to the table proped up in the corner of the ring.
Bloodshed grabs a bag of nails and throws it on Marasmus' chest.  He then
goes to the top of the ladder, and balences on the very top, he is roughly
30 feet above the ground, counting the ring.  The ladder starts wobbling and
Bloodshed kicks it out from under him then jumps off towards Marasmus.  The 
ladder gets to Marasmus first, and then soon after Bloodshed jumps right on 
it, crushing Marasmus and breaking the table.  Marasmus has blood coming
though his shirt and back, and face.

Mike: Wow...this is one of the most intense matches I have seen in a long, 
long time, that move took guts.

Bloodshed also is in tons of pain, bleeding from the face and chest.  He 
manages to get up, but collapses soon after.  Lizzy runs over to Marasmus 
and yells at him to get up, Marasmus rolls off the broken table and drops 
his arm on Bloodshed.  The ref starts the count: 1......2.....3 and Marasmus
is the new .ORG champion!  

Mike: Well there you- wait a minute...here it is...here is my handy work.

A man runs to the ring, with a boxing robe on and you can't see his face. He
runs over to Bloodshed's body and looks down at him.  Bloodshed looks up 
weakly: "what the...how the hell?  Wait a minute!  No wonder! Bitch!" and 
then Bloodshed blacks out.  The person takes off the hood to reveal who he
is.  Marasmus looks at him shocked, Lizzy screams.  It is an identical 
version of Marasmus!  They look exactly the same!  The man begins to speak.

?????: "listen up, my name is Saynt.  Marasmus, you don't know it, and you
will deny it all you can and you will deny it, but the truth is this, we 
were twins, as cleche as it may sound, we were identical twins seperated at
birth.  And as "scream 3ish" as it may sound, I went to my mother, asked her
to take me in as her son, but she denyed me...the truth is she couldn't 
handle two sons, she didn't want two sons...just becuase you were born a few
minutes before me you got the life I should have had...but we are brothers, 
and I am willing to forgive and forget.  Bloodshed weaves into this, but I 
think it would be a little more fun if I were to let him explain it...there
 is a reason he has hated you since the beginning, trust me, it wasn't just 
"lets find someone who doesn't have an angle" He thought you were the cause 
of something in his life, but I'll let you put two and two together...hahaha,
I'm out...g'bye everyone and good night.

Mike: So there you have it, my little suprise for Bloodshed.  I promised him
something, and he got what he wanted and more...Saynt...another enemy for
Bloodshed to cuss out...but we have a busy night, so lets get onto our next
match.
And the Winner is: Marasmus
********************************************************

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 4: Nightcrawler Vr. Kaos and Arch Angel --Handicap Match for Angel's honor
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike: Ok, most people need to be a bit more serious here, basically because
this isn't just for the win and the pin, but this is for defending the 
honor of a great wrestler who has died.  Some people this very seriously, 
two of whom are in the ring tonight, but there are others, even some fans,
who spit at the idea of Angel dead...they talk about how he is coming back
tonight...yeah, there is rumors flying around...that just sickens me.

Mike: In honor of the death of Angel, Arch Angel and Kaos have requested no
showy intros be played, this isn't a show match, it's a respect match.  So
the wrestlers won't have normal intros, they will just walk out, speaking of
that, here they come now.

Kaos and Arch Angel walk to the ring.  Then Night Crawler and a girl come
to the ring.

Mike: Ahhh, that girl with him, that's Dream, she's supposed to be some 
heavy competition for Lizzy Borden for Fed Badd Ass girl.

Dream goes to the side and screams for Night Crawler to rip him apart.  
Night Crawler smiles and charges Kaos.  He grabs Kaos for a powerbomb, but
Arch Angel goes to the top rope and jumps down, right onto Night Crawler's 
head.  Night Crawler gets back up, and quickly nails Kaos with a DDT and 
does a quick legsweep to get Arch Angel to the ground.  He puts them on top
of each other and does a elbow drop.

Mike: Let's see how long Nightcrawler lasts like this.

Arch Angel and Kaos get up at the Same time.  Night Crawler punches Arch
Angel back down to the mat and Kaos does a reverse DDT to Night Crawler.
Dream cheers from the side.  Kaos goes to the top rope while Arch Angel
holds Night Crawler in place.  He goes for a moonsault but Dream runs over 
and grabs a foot, causing Kaos to loose his momntum, he falls neck first 
onto Night Crawler's chest and flips over and kicks Arch Angel, who was
holding Night crawler down by the shoulders, in the head.  All three are 
a little dazed, but Arch Angel is the first one up.  Dream calls him over,
annoyed he goes over, Dream takes out a can of mace and sprays him in the 
eyes.

Mike: God, it's hard to not inturrupt everythign when you are the prez 
posing as a commentator.

As all three wrestlers are lying on the ground...knocked out...Backstage
Johnny No Where sighs and says thats it, if Night Crawler can't do it, I 
will, and No Where runs out to the ring.

Mike: Commentator...Commentator...you are a Commentator...

No Where comes out and slams the ref witha  chair, just to ensure that 
Nightcrawler doesn't get d/qed Arch Angel with a chair, Kaos gets up to 
defend himself, but is rejected with a shot to the head with a chair.  He
goes over to Night Crawler looking for agknowledgement but Night Crawler 
shoves him away.  Dream shoves him away also and yells to get him away.

Mike: Night Crawler wanted this match for himself.  It looks like him and
dream aren't the only sick sadistic people in this federation...

Nightcrawler goes for the pin on Kaos: 1.......2.......3 so now it is just 
a one on one, with Arch Angel and Night Crawler.  Then, on the Online-Tron
a shot of ANGEL, THE ANGEL, walking into the ring comes on.  Arch Angel 
screams profanitys while Nightcrawler smiles and runs backstage while Arch
Angel just sits into the ring dumbfounded by what he just saw 1.....2......3
.....4........5........6........7.........8.........9..........10 and the 
winner of the match by countout is Arch Angel.

Mike: Holy shit....what the hell....Listen, I gotta go investigate this, I
won't be here for the next match, unless need be, so I'll be back for the 
world title match, but I won't be here next match.
(((Mike runs out to investigate Angel)))

And the Winner is: Arch Angel and Kaos

Match 5: Crossbones Vr. Skull --Inferno Match
=============================================================================
 After an event that can only be described as amazing, there is only one more 
match to see. And that match ... is the most heated of the evening. Since the 
arrival of Skull, tensions have flared between the two brothers, bringing all 
the anger and frustration ... literally to a boil! Here, at Back In Business, 
the ring will be Ground Zero ... for what could be the biggest match in OWF 
2000 and OWF history alike! After the usual intros are made, Skull and his escort, 
Stryfe, stand alone in the ring, awaiting the arrival of the OWF 2000 .COM 
champion. Suddenly, the arena lights fade to black, as sharp organ chords blaze 
through the ears of the fans. Everyone can feel it. This is the moment. This is 
finally the day everyone has looked forward to for months. Suddenly, the fire 
from the generator kicks in, bringing to life a blaze that matches any ever seen 
before. Both Stryfe and Skull are surrounded by the flames, as a voice is 
suddenly heard.
 
 Crossbones: For many nights and days I have meditated on this very night ... this 
very moment. And finally, Skull ... my brother, it has arrived. For in a matter of 
moments ... one of us will be set on fire!
 
 At those very words, the crowd exploded in cheers for the .COM champion, 
who though heard, was yet to be seen. Then, the fire around the ring died down. 
Then, to highten the intensity, the president of the OWF, President Mike  made 
his appearence. Walking out onto the landing of the arena, the crowd instantly 
acknowledged him with a mixed reaction. Standing behind him, a band of three 
police officers stood, one of them brandishing a  shiny set of cuffs.
 
 Mike: Now Skull ... Stryfe, I know that you two probably have some plan that 
involves Stryfe helping deliver the final blow into the fire if need be, bringing 
Crossbones to the floor in a heap of flames. But guys ... that just ain't gonna 
happen. At the special request of the OWF 2000 .COM champion himself, Stryfe will 
be removed from the ringside area, handcuffed, taken to the back, and taken care 
of by my friends here. So men ... if you would ...
 
 At the words of the OWF 2000 president, the police officers slowly began to 
walk to the ring, a smile sweeping over the face of Mike, as he walked to the 
back. As the cops neared ever closer to the ringside area, Stryfe began to grow
 uneasy, beads of sweat dropping to the ring mat. When the cops entered the ring, 
his heavy expression dropped away, a sense of calm obviously flooding over his 
body. To the shock of the arena, he quietly went into the handcuffs, putting up 
no resistence. As the police officers walked him towards the back, Crossbones' 
music once again kicked in, as the lights faded away. For several seconds the 
lights remained off, leaving the crowd in confusion. Then, fire surrounded the 
ring. As soon as it did, it was well lit enough that the crowd could make out two 
figures in the ring. One Skull. The other ... Crossbones!
 
 The usual stare down that accompinies the beginning of a match is denied, as 
Crossbones glides across the ring, slamming a fist hard to the face of his brother. 
Its stirs a reaction, as the two begin to exchange blows, moving toward the center of 
the ring. Finally, Skull blocks a jab with the flat of his arm, sending a knee to 
the gut of his brother. The crowd begins to boo, as Crossbones is stomped to the 
ring mat. Foot after foot is smacked on Crossbones, as the crowd reaction grows ever 
louder. Finally, the barrage is stopped, as Skull glares out at the fans, a sneer 
slivering across his lips. Skull reached down, pulling Crossbones' limp body to  a 
standing position. Suddenly, he unloaded with a series of chops, that smacked his 
chest, knocking him once again to the mat. Then, Skull's head turned toward the 
turnbuckles, the smile growing larger. Dragging Crossbones' body over to the corner, 
leaving it in a heap, he climbed to the top, flames licking at the sides of his boots. 
Finally, he dove toward Crossbones ... and watched in horror as he rolled out of the 
way! He crashed to the hard mat, as Crossbones leaped to his feet. Full of energy, 
Crossbones, who had been playing a game of possum, waited for Skull to regain his 
footing. Crossbones drove a missle dropkick to his face, knocking him back down, 
even knocking him out for a time. Then, Crossbones picked him up, dropping him down 
in a belly - to - belly suplex, crushing him to the mat in the center of the ring. 
Then, it was Crossbones pointing to the turnbuckle, whipping the fans into a frenzy. 
Avoiding the towering flames, he straghtened out his body, and dove off, performing 
a perfect version of the Sternum splash! Then, picking him up from his downed 
position, he threw Skull through the ropes, into the wall of fire! The match was 
over! Or ... was it?! When Skull landed, the ref of the match noticed that he had 
passed through unscathed, his body still normal. No flames. An infuriated, yet 
relieved look crossed Crossbones' face, as he realized his brother was not on fire. 
Looking around in slight confusion, Crossbones decided that he would have to exit the 
ring, as re-entry for Skull would be nearly impossible. Jumping again to the top, 
Crossbones leaped straight down, landing comfortably on the ringside mats. Crossbones
 slowly walked toward the heap that was Skull, a look of pain over his face. But as he 
neared, Skull rolled to his knees, using his arm to pull off a low blow. Crossbones 
keeled over, as Skull slowly pulled himself to his feet. When he finally did, instead 
of walking toward the Hardcore champion, he walked away from him, toward the 
commentators desk. Throwing the timekeeper from his chair, he folded it up, and turned 
toward the kneeling Crossbones. Waiting patiently, he waited until Crossbones was up 
to his feet, and smacked the chair into his face, busting his head wide open. Crossbones, 
his eyes rolling to the back of his skull, fell to the mats, as Skull cracked a smile. 
Skull continued the assault, driving the chair to the knee of Crossbones, causing a cry 
of pain to escape into the crowd. Finally, after several chair shots, he tossed it to 
the side, again walking away from Crossbones. His eyes scanned the area, apparently 
looking for something to use on the damaged Crossbones. As he did, Crossbones began 
to stir, pulling himself toward the ring. When he reached it, he rolled under the 
ring, disappearing from sight. Meanwhile, Skull had found his weapon of destruction 
... a wooden table!!! Hooking his fingers under it, he began to drag it around to 
where Crossbones had been. As he did so, a huge tear began to appear in the ring mat, 
as one of the corners ripped open, as Crossbones pulled himself through! At about 
that time, Skull realized he was gone, as he began to look around in confusion. When 
he finally spotted him, it was too late. Crossbones was in mid-suicide dive, crashing 
into Skull. The crowds reaction was exactly what the move deserved, causing Crossbones 
to quickly rise to his feet. Noticing the still-folded table, he stumbled towards it, 
setting it up near one of the ring posts, a smile crossing his face. Then, he did a 
quick slam onto the table, leaving Skull unconscious on the table. With a gleam in his 
eyes, Crossbones rolled under the ring, appearing when he had crawled back through the 
hole, into the ring. Running, he dove to the top, regaining his balance. Then he gave 
the signal, it was time for the dreaded Sternum Splash ... through the table! Using 
his entire leg for the proper acceleration, he dove, straightening his body in mid-stride. 
But as he neared, Skull rolled off of the table, causing Crossbones to splinter the table 
in half, landing hard on the arena floor. By this time, the fire surrounding the ring was 
beginning to get to the both of them, sweat streaming, pooling under them. Both men were 
out of it, their strength spent. Splinters of wood cut into the back of Crossbones, 
tearing clumbs of skin. Suddenly, the large video screen leapt to life, an image in the 
locker room appearing. The image ... was pure chaos! Three police officers lay on cold 
cement, blood surrounding their bodies. Lines of lockers covered the floor, torn down 
from their position. But the sight that caught the attention of the crowd ... was a pair 
of broken handcuffs that the camera zoomed in on. Stryfe was free ... and neither Skull 
nor Crossbones were any the wiser! After about a minute of no action, Skull began to stir, 
climbing to his knees. Finally, he stumbled over to Crossbones, his eyes going up to the 
screen. When he saw the broken handcuffs, he chuckled, eventually breaking out into a 
hysterical laugh. Then ... he appeared. First, a burst of fire in the entranceway. Then 
smoke. And then, Stryfe walked from the depths of the smoke, cloaked in his usual hood. 
He walked to the landing, a mic in his hand.
 
 Stryfe: I am so sorry to interrupt this precious brother to brother moment, but I 
feel I deserve this moment ... because of the way I was man-handled earlier this evening. 
President, you must realize this. At no time were those " officers of the law " 
in control of the situation. I merely went with the flow of the moment, waiting for the 
perfect time to make my triumphant return! And finally, I believe I should be able to 
see the match ... that in essence ... I created!
 
 Dropping the mic to his side, his hooded eyes stared at the final moments of the match.
 By this time, Crossbones was being dragged to his feet, as Skull performed a quick snap 
suplex. When Crossbones hit, Skull went up quickly, a series of stomps following behind. 
When Crossbones attempted to sit up, Skull dropped a knee on his right shoulder, a 
snap ringing out. A scream followed it up, as another knee drop was performed. 
After a few of the knee drops, Crossbones stopped attempting to stand, instead 
clutching his shoulder in pain. Then, for the second time in the match, he 
reached under the ring. The first time he had retrieved a table, what could possibly 
be worse. Of course he finds it ... what is worse than a table. A ladder, that towers 
high above the ring! A savage look filled his eyes, as he set it up, straightening it. 
Then, he walked back over to Crossbones, trying to pull him up by his hair. When he 
got him to his knees, a sent an elbow to Skull, scoring a low blow. Skull keeled over, 
as Crossbones hooked a belly - to - belly, causing the fans to finally get back into 
the match. Crossbones, though, did not release the hold. He instead picked him back up, 
never breaking contact, and dropped him in it again. Finally, he performed it once 
again, and released him on the downflow. Now, he finally felt it was time to seal the deal.
 But it would not be over until he crushed him into the mats with his move, the sternum splash. 
First, he looked to the ring post, the crowd giving a mediocre response. But then he spotted the 
ladder, and the crowd really went wild. Leaping up to the first rung, he quickly scaled it, 
until finally he was at the top. When he reached there, his courageous look fell apart, as his
 body began to quiver. Then, he saw him. Stryfe! When he saw him, his look returned, as he dove 
off, performing a perfect sternum splash, causing blood to spray from Skull's mouth, internal 
bleeding definate. But Crossbones was so full of rage that the fall left him unharmed, as he 
pulled Skull to his feet. Dragging his toward the fire, he prepared to throw him into it.
 
 Stryfe: Crossbones! Stop! For the love of God, stop! What are you doing?! Why are you 
doing this?! Would you really throw your own flesh and blood into those flames? Would you 
condemn him to the flaming pits before his time! Would you make me watch this? Would you 
make me ...
 
 Reaching up, Stryfe pulled the hood away, revealing his face for the first time ever. His 
hair was trimmed up to the top, coming up to a full head of hair. He looked to be about 
forty, but could be both younger or older. But the thing that caught everyone's eye, 
especially Crossbones', was the symbol carved into his forehead. The same symbol that 
Skull and Crossbones had in the same position. 
 
 Stryfe: Would you make me, your father, watch this madness?!?!
 
 As the word father rolled off his lips, Crossbones let his brother drop, all hope fading 
from his eyes and face. A look of horror was all he could muster. But in his moment of 
shock and weakness, Skull recovered, shoving Crossbones toward the flames, making his 
body plunge into them. Fire consumed him as the bell was rung. Men with fire extinguishers 
rushed to his aid, as the belt was handed to a battered and bruised Skull. Skull and his 
father left the arena, leaving a burned Crossbones. Battered. Bruised. Burned. Without his 
title. Even after the fire extinguishers put him out, Crossbones remained on the mat, tears 
dripping down ... soaking the ring. Crossbones prediction had come true ... but in a way 
he never intended. Everything had indeed been stripped away ... but not from Skull. No 
matter what happened from now on, nothing would ever ... could ever be the same!

Match 6: Shawn Matthews Vr. Purple Haze - WorldWW title match
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike: This is it folks, the first-ever world title match in the OWF 2000. If
you followed the OWF a few years back you know that I like to have the first
match for the World title a memorable one--at the Pay Per View.  And if you
have been following the OWF 2000 you know that this match is crazy.  These
two guys basically got lucky because the originally scheduled match was 
between Angel and Valek.  But Valek quit and Angel died, and ever...ybody
thinks that Angel is going to waltz out here and reclaim his spot in the
match...I used think that people who thought that were sick, but after 
seeing what Ijust saw I honestly don't know what will happen.  Oh well, here
comes Matthews.

(((Matthews' music comes on and he walks to the ring, the crowd booing.  The
normal pyro is going on and he makes his way to the ring.)))

Mike: I don't really know why they don't like that guy...

(((Purple Haze by Jimi Hendrix comes on and he comes to the ring, asking 
people how they are doing today, the crowd cheers.)))

Mike: Ok...well here we go.

Matthews jumps at Haze and they lock up. Matthews goes for a suplex but Haze
denies it with a kick to the stomach.  Haze lifts up Matthews and doeas a
hanging vertical suplex.  Matthews hits the ground, you can see the Matthews'
neck bounce off the mat very fast, so fast he could get whiplash from that.
Matthews from the ground does a quick jump up and kicks Haze in the chin.  
He goes for a DDT, but Haze stops it.  Matthews does a flip over Haze, still
holding Haze's head, and does a neckbreaker.

Mike: Reversals galore...gotta love it.  I swear, you cue guys...enjoy your
time here while you still have it...

Matthews gets up and kicks Haze a few times in the chest and does a leg drop.
He gets up and goes for a elbow drop, Haze gets up and Mattews hits  his 
elbow at full force on the ground.  Haze goes to the top rope. The crowd 
cheers. He does a double moonsault, and lands it.  Haze looks a little dazed
and Matthews is in pain, clutching his chest for breat.  Haze gets up and 
throws Matthews out of the ring, the ref starts the count, but Mike gets up
and tells the ref no count outs or d/qs.

Mike: I don't care anymore.  Let them do what they want to do.

Haze looks up and asks for cheers from the audience.  He receives tons and
handshakes a few.  Matthews gets up, Haze rolls his eyes and hits Matthews' 
head into the barricade.  The crowd goes wild.  Haze goes to the top rope 
and jumps down with his elbows hitting Matthews' back.  Matthews hits he 
ground. Matthews jumps up with all his power and does a kick to Haze's face.
He quickly punches the face again and lands a DDT on the floor.  Matthews
gets up and throws Haze up the ramp.  Matthews runs after Haze and shoves
him off side.  Matthews looks to the crowd for cheers, but gets none, he 
shakes it off and does a triple flip off a 20 foot drop.  Right onto Haze
who was laying on the concrete.  Both men are out of it.

Mike: Oh god!

The ref sprints over and goes for the count, even though both men are 
uncouncious. 1..........2....and Jack Flagg runs out and hits the ref.  He
takes a table and throws it ontop of Matthews.  He grabs Haze and puts him
on top of Matthews.   30 seconds later a ref comes and does the count: 
1...........2...........and Matthews jumps up, grabs the table that was used
on him and hits Haze: 1.......2.........3 and there you have it, the World
champion of the OWF 2000.

Mike: There he is, Shawn Matthews, our first world champ. 

Both men ly there, completely oblivious to everything that just happened.

(((The lights then go out...all of a sudden a small, tiny light goes into the
middle of the ring.  The camera zooms it, it is just a small candle on a small
wooden table. Then a huge explosion happens by the entranceway and all that is
left of the fire after the fireball is a big "A"  Finally Matthews gets up, 
realizing he won, shows happiness...he walks to the entranceway with his new
belt but a big figure comes out in a cloak, and shoves him aside, Matthews, 
still dazed from his match, falls to the ground but runs away.)))

Anarchy: My Name Is Anarchy...the A you see above me...it stands for so many
things...the A...the first letter of the alphabet, but more importantly, the
start of the alphabet...there is nothing before it, as there is nothing before
me.  I am here to start this thing on fire.  Everything you knew is gone until
now...now is where real things come into play, with Survivor coming up Tuesday,
things are coming faster than you imagine..realizations will be made...and I am
here to start them.

(((Anarchy walks out of the arena)))

Mike: Anarchy...he was in the OWF a while back...he was also in the OWO...some of
you may know him as Buff Bagwell from the OWO...but I doubt it.

And The winner is: Shawn Matthews
*****************************************************************************

All of a sudden the shot of Angel come back on and music starts to play, 
In the Air of the Night by Phil Collins starts to play.

Mike: WTF???

A girl walks to the ring as Angel is still walking around the arena on the
Online-Tron.  

Mike: I know her!  That is my sister's old friend...what's her name....Katie
Katie something...

Katie: Hello, My name is Katie Johnson and I am Angel's little sister.  If
you knew Angel you would know that he was in wrestling for the long run, the
present didn't mean much to him, he was always looking into the future, 
planning things to a T, and I guess that is why he told me to come here if
(sniffle) this ever happened.  He said if Anything ever happens where he 
isn't able to talk I should come to the ring and show this tape which is 
playing.  Angel taped this when he first joined the OWF, so Night Crawler,
you saw the grave, he isn't here, don't bother looking, he warned me that
there would be people like you, but have at least some respect for me and
my family.  But anyways, here is what he had to say to you guys.  

The movie fast fowards to see Angel go to a small room and sit down.

Angel: I guess I should have known that this sort of thing would happen, if
you are seeing this, I have died...but I am not done.  If my sister is 
playing this tape, I have died reletively shortly after I have joined the
OWF...that's pretty shitty...but according to my timeline, you have not 
found out who "he" was.  Well it's more complicated than you think, the 
person who used to have a plan that I religiously followed, he or him, well
I left his ways and stopped following him, which means I got lots of pain.
Well now, I think it is only fair to tell you the whole story about him and
how he came about--(((the camera goes fuzzy and a taped game of a Green
Bay Packer game.)))  

Katie: Oh my god...I am so sorry ladies and gentleman, someone must have 
taped over this...i have never watched the tape because he told me not to.
I have no clue how long it has been like this...I am sorry, I don't know
what else I can do to help (she looks to the ceiling) why?  I am so sorry!
I tried everything I could!  I am really sorry!  Why like this?  Why did you
do it!?!

Mike: And that was that...that was our first pay per view...and Angel is 
for real dead...people thought he was coming back...he wasn't.  His sister
told you herself...I hope you all enjoyed our first Pay Per View from my
hometown...ironically it is also Angel's.
