!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tonight, on Surge:
------------------
After a rough week in terms of loosing or firing 
wrestlers, the OWF is still going strong and ready to put
out just as good as a card.  Tonight we have a triple
threat match: Steven Styles Vr. Jack Flagg Vr. HTK Shawn
Matthews, Lightning Vr. Shane Bishop Vr. Genocide for 
20,000 dollars, plus, Mike says he has a few...suprises
for us all.  Get ready for the minor show of the week, but
never a bad read, SATURDAY NIGHT SURGE!
--------------------------------------------------------
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


****************************************
(((The crowd is sitting in their seats, awaiting the show to start, they
are sceptical about what will be going on tonight because of the roster
changes that have happened as of late...but they know that Mike will not
dissapoint.  Finally the lights go out, and Mike walks to the ring.)))

Mike: Whoa, what a tough week huh?  Well most prez's would say screw it, 
the fed is over, but I know that it is not over, not by a longshot, and 
I have a few suprises for you tonight.  But let's go with the bad news 
first, first, Valek has quit, so the match between him and Bloodshed is 
cancelled and Bloodshed gets the .ORG title.  Second, the Tag Team match
that was scheduled between Ultimatum and Dallas Star and Purple haze, 
cancelled, because Ultimatum is incapacitated.  Don't worry, I do 
have a few plans though, for tonight, let's start with the obvious, now
as you all know the main even for the OWF Back In Business was Valek Vr. 
Angel, well Valek has quit, so we need a challenger for Angel, and that
person WILL be determined on Tuesday.  Bloodshed will face the winner
of the Triple Threat match on Tuesday to see who gets a WorldWW title 
shot, so Steven Styles, Jack Flagg, or HTK will face Bloodshed on Tuesday
for a shot at the WorldWW title.  So, FOR NOW, the card consists of 2 
matches, but don't worry folks, I still have one more, huge, suprise 
coming up for tonight.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 1: Steven Styles Vr. HTK Vr. Jack Flagg
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny: Well here we are, Saturday Night Surge, the holdover until Tuesday,
luckily, we have Barry here with us tonight, most of you remember last 
Tuesday where I got out of hand and Barry left, but not before challenging
me to a match at Back in Business.  Which will happen.  How are you tonight,
Barry?

Barry: I'm fine, and you're gay.

Johnny: Wha-?  Wha-?  What?  That is like my trademark!

Barry: Not anymore homo.  Well anyways, this match is a regular every
man for himself in the ring, and the new stipulation is that Mike signed
it to be a shot for a shot at the title shot.

Johnny: That was pretty dumb.

Barry: Yeah...and you are pretty ugly.  Well here comes Steven Styles.

(((Steven Styles' music comes on and he walks to ther ring looking for
cheers from the audience.  He stops from being happy and gets into a
serious mode.  He walks to the ring and waits for both opponents to
come out.)))

Barry: That entrance was almost as gay as you.

Johnny: Wha?  What?  I am the disser, you are the dissy.

Barry: No, I would be the disser and you would be the pussy.

Johnny: Barry?  What the hell man?

Barry: Here comes HTK, a ladies man, something Johnny pretends to be, 
but we all know the truth...

(((HTK's music comes on and the girls go nuts.  HTK walks to the ring,
flexing his muscles and all.  The girls scream as if Backstreet and 
NSYNC were in the same building)))

Johnny: I don't get why they scream, he is known as a playa.

Barry: Yeah, you are known as a player in Queens. 

Johnny: Barry...what the hell man...why are you making fun of me?

Barry: Gay and Stupid...

(((Jack Flaggs music comes on, and he comes out, signals for the match to
start and the bell rings.  HTK and Styles start fighting while Flagg makes
his way slowly to the ring.)))

HTK gives Styles a kick to the stomach and then does a northern lights
suplex, right into the pin: 1...... and it's an easy kick out for Styles.
Then Flagg dives in the ring and does a reverse DDT to HTK.  Flagg goes
to the top ropes but Styles lifts him off and slams him into the mat, and
goes for the pin: 1..........and it's an easy kick out for Flagg.  

Barry: Johnny, these attempts at pins are almost as retarded as your mother!

Johnny: this isn't like you Barry.

Barry: I know, it's like you, gay, now you know how I felt, but you know you
always dissed me to hide the fact that you were the one who was gay.

HTK gets up and does a reverse suplex on Styles.  HTK runs to the ropes and
does a running elbow drop on Styles.  HTK gets up and Jack Flagg does a flying
clothesline on HTK.  Flagg goes to the top ropes and does a moonsault on both
of them.  Flagg does a flip, but it wasn't very controlled or clean, he landed 
on Styles' balls, the ref saw that one.

Johnny: uh oh, Flagg got caught...

Barry: uh oh...how gay.

The ref starts going over and yells at Flagg, Flagg yells back, the ref gives
Flagg a shove, Flagg shoves the ref back.  The ref throws Flagg out of the 
match, meanwhile all this HTK is giving Styles repeated shots to the nuts, 
Styles is about to cry, as any man would in this situation.  Finally when
Flagg reluctantly left HTK picks up Styles and does the Lights out cleanly.
HTK goes for the pin: 1.........2.........3 and HTK gets the shot at the 
shot on Tuesday.

And the Winner is:  HTK, Shawn Matthews

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 2: Lightning Vr. Shane Bishop Vr. Genocide for 20,000--Ladder Match
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barry: Johnny, you are so gay.

Johnny: I need to leave man, this isn't my scene.

Barry: Yeah, this isn't my scene neither.  (Both announcers get up and
leave in opposite sides of the ring...Mike runs out and goes to the ring
announcer spot.)

Mike: Well...uhh....It looks like I will need to be ring announcer for this
event....and....uhhhh......next event there won't be a ref cause you'll see
why... I can't.......uhhhh.....well screw the intros, lets get this over 
with....HEY EVERYONE JUST COME OUT!

(((The three opponents slowly walk out with puzzled looks on their faces.
They go to the ring and sort of look to mike)))

Mike: Yeah, intros don't really matter...I don't care....well anyways...
This match is a ladder match for 20,000 dollars, but what the hell is that
we are a multibillion dollar corparation....so I guess I will be throwing
in a bit of my own money, seeing as I have nothing to use it for, this match
is now for 1 million dollars.......do I care?  Not really.  THX will 
give me my money back.  They are pretty dumb...Here that guys? (the wrestlers
nod at the anticipation of a million dollar opportunity) Ok, now fight
god dammit!

Shane Bishop runs at Lightning while Genocide runs to get the ladder.  
Bishop and Lightning lock up and Genocide grabs the ladder and knocks over
both wrestlers.

Mike: uhhh....ouch...what can I say, I'm not a ring announcer and as of now
the cue dudes are fired...what is this crap!  Now I know what Johnny was 
talking about...

Genocide picks up Lightning and does a Body Slam on the ladder.  Lightning
shows alot of pain.  Shane Bishop runs up and slams Genocides head onto the
ladder.  Bishop picks up the ladder and slams it on both of the wrestlers, 
then sets it up.  He starts climbing it and then Genocide gets up.  Bishop
knows he won't make it, he is about 15 feet up the 20 foot ladder, so he
dives off and lands right on Lightning.  Genocide Starts climbing the ladder
but Bishop gets up and tips over the ladder, Genocide flys right over the 
edge of the ring!

Mike: Now I remember why I retired from being a wrestler...

Lightning and Bishop start climbing opposite sides of the ladder.  When they
get almost to the top Bishop looks Lightning straight in the eyes, then 
gives him the finger, and jumps off the ladder, but not before grabbing 
Lightning's head and landing a Flying DDT from 17 feet high!!!

Mike: (Stands up to see more clearly)  Oh my god!  I'll bet that wouldn't have
happened if this was only for 20,000 dollars!!!  Wait, here comes Genocide
again!

Genocide runs in the ring and grabs Shane before he can climb the ladder.
He Slams Bishops nose into the ladder then does it again, and then tries
it again, but Bishop moves out of the way and Genocides momentum causes
Genocide to fall to the ground on his face.  Bishop looks down and flicks
off Genocide, then stomps on the back of his head.

Mike: Oh my god...I think I heard is jaw break...oh by god....

Bishop climbs the ladder unopposed, when he was about 18 feet up and within
and arms reach of the money box Lightning gets back up and throws the ladder
down, but Bishop was ready for it and jumped up as high as he could and
grabs the money box, but it doesn't budge...he is holding on 35 feet above
the ground...Finally Bishop just uses all his weight to pull it off and falls 
right onto Lightning for the win.

Mike: Wow, the winner of that did deserve the mil.  Well I gotta go...you'll
see me soon, don't worry.
And the Winner is: Shane Bishop

Match 3: Did you think it would really only be two matches? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(((5 minutes later, the crowd wondering whats going on...then something
comes on the THX mega screen)))

On Tuesday Night Taser, the premier show of the OWF 2000, there was a match. 
A triple threat match. In that match, for reasons unknown to anyone ... 
anywhere ... Crossbones lost his championship belt to Mark Blaze, who 
is now the new OWF 2000 .Com Champion. That match was less than a week ago, 
and much controversy has begun to surround the situation. Crossbones has 
since quit because of unfair traetment by the company, President Mike 
refusing to comment on the behind the scenes situation. Mark Blaze has been set up 
with a mystery opponent on Saturday Night Surge. Kirk Storm, the other 
opponent in the triple threat contest, has challenged for the title, and many 
are speculating that it is him who is the mystery opponent of Mark Blaze 
for the gold. As the fans wait in anticipation, the music of the .Com champion, 
Mark Blaze, comes over the loudspeaker, announcing the arrival. Walking to 
the ring, a strut to his swagger, a smile was stretched all across his 
face. Across his waist was the .Com championship belt. Sliding into the ring, 
he removed the belt from his waist, flinging it into the air, a cockiness 
in his very movements. Then, grabbing a mic, he began to speak.

Mark Blaze: Welcome one, welcome all ... I would like to introduce to 
you ... the new OWF 2000 .Com Champion ... me! On Tuesday Night, I ended a 
legacy. I pinned Crossbones, and became the third ever .Com champion!! 
But then Mike ... oh dear sweet Mike, has to go and ruin the entire 
situation by setting me up with a mystery opponent tonight at Saturday Night Surge. 
But Mike, if this is ome way of trying to screw me over ... you're gonna 
have to try some new tactics. Not only do I promise to beat whomever your 
deranged mind has picked out ... I promise to make him bleed. I promise to make 
him scream for mercy. I promise ... to make him tap out! So I am making ... 
a submissions only match ... right here on Saturday Night Surge!!! So 
whoever you are ... why don't you just bring it!Suddenly, the music of the 
President, Mike, came over the sound system, cheers erupting all over the arena.
When he appeared, wearing a ratty T-Shirt and Jean Shorts, obviously ready 
to leave the arena, he raised his fist, causing even more cheers all over the arena. 
Then, mic in hand, he begun.

Mike: Mark Blaze ... new .Com champion. Well buddy, you did it. You really 
handed it to Crossbones. You took him down you made him cry like a 
baby, didn't you?

Mark Blaze: Yeah ... then he quits! He quit because he was scared ... of 
me!! He didn't ask for a rematch he just leaves the building squealin' 
like a little girl! HaHaHa ...

As Mark Blaze continued to gloat, Mike began to laugh holding his gut, 
then looking at his watch. With a look of shock on his face, he got back to 
business, lifting the mic back to his mouth.

Mike: Well, that's great and all, but I'd better get back to what I was 
out here to do anyways. I have to introduce to you ... you're opponent!

Even as he said the words, the music of Kirk Storm came on over the loud 
speaker, marking the arrival of the obvious candidate for the shot at 
the belt. Kirk, clad in wrestling attire, walked out from the backstage 
area, beginning to walk towards the ring. When he got within arms reach of 
the ring, his music stopped, Mike once again speaking into the mic.

Mike: Whoa, whoa, whoa ... what the hell are you doing? Did I ever say, 
at any point, that you were Blaze's opponent? No ... I don't think so! But 
I did invite you out here for one thing. Please direct your eyes ... to 
the video screen.

On the screen, the closing moments of Tuesday's match came on, 
showing a downed Crossbones being pinned by Mark Blaze, hard shots to the gut as 
the pin went on. Suddenly, the camera zoomed in on Crossbones' shoulders, 
as the referee prepared to count the three. Before his hand touched the mat, 
Crossbones' right shoulder shot into the air, moving from the mat! Quickly, 
Blaze shoved it back down, the ref not even noticing! Then the three was 
counted. Then the screen went blank. All throughout the arena, fans of 
Crossbones booed the clip, some even throwing objects at the screen! Mike 
tried to calm them, but he couldn't. Instead, he just moved on.

Mike: So ... afetr reviewing that footage time and time again, I was finally 
able to come up with your opponent tonight at Saturday Night Surge. And 
that man ... is Crossbones!

The crowd, reeling from shock of the announcement, began to cheer, as 
the lights of the arena disappeared. Walking from behind the stage 
curtains, Crossbones began to walk toward the ring. Kirk Strom, still upset, ran 
at him, prepared to tackle the returning demon. Crossbones, barely moving 
a muscle reached out his hand, stopping him in his tracks. Waving his 
hand, Crossbones caused Storm to simply ... collapse! Then, turning back to 
Blaze, he leapt into the ring, prepared for the fight of his life.

Stepping into the ring, Crossbones was instantly grounded with an 
elbow to the forehead, knocking him hard to the mat. As if in serious pain, 
Crossbones remained on the mat, as Mark Blaze sent a flurry of kicks to 
his gut, Crossbones' arms clutching it. Blaze, obviously feeling better 
about his chances, tugged on the hair of Crossbones, jerking him to his feet. 
Then, there was a chop. Then another, followed up by three more. Each 
one rang out through the arena, causing members of the capacity crowd to 
shudder. Then Blaze tossed the man, once thought unstoppable to the ropes, 
catching him in a sleeper hold. As he began to drain the energy from Crossbones, 
he began to shout out to the booing fans, proclaiming a victory that was yet to 
come. Dropping Crossbones to his knees, the fans began to wonder what had 
happened to Crossbones since Tuesday night that could make him fight this bad. In 
the span of the entire match, he'd yet to hit Blaze with even the weakest of moves. 
As Crossbones seemingly passed out, the ref moved to ring the bell, then 
stopping himself. The match, as announced earlier in the night, was won by
tap out only. Blaze began to cackle, as Crossbones' limp body slumped over, 
supported only by the arms of Mark Blaze. Blaze released the hold, satisfied with 
his performance thus far. 

Then, as if ready to seal the deal, he dove to the outside of the ring, 
walking toward the timekeepers table. Tossing the man from his seat, Blaze 
folded it up, sliding it into the ring. Then he waited. What seemed like an 
eternity, was only a few seconds, as he waited for Crossbones to get up. 
When Crossbones was to his knees, he began to smile, pointing to his head, 
begging Blaze to hit him with the chair. Then ... he did. Pulling back 
with all his strength, Blaze smacked the chair onto the tip of the skull of 
Crossbones, causing an echo throughout the arena. When he lifted the 
chair away, Crossbones ... was smiling. In the same position as before, he 
began to rise to his feet, as Blaze smashed the chair to his head again, this 
time denting the steel. Again ... nothing. Crossbones' smile grew across his 
face, seeming to split it in half, as he begun to laugh. Then, for the 
final time, Blaze swung the chair. It would have been the shot. It would have 
been the shot that would have taken Crossbones down to the mat ... if he had 
not stopped it in midair. Crossbones now held the chair in his fist, a 
laugh filled with evil emitting from deep in his throat. Then ... it was 
over. Still holding the chair, Crossbones smashed it into the skull of Blaze, 
shattering his nose, as blood flew, spraying all over the ring. Blaze's 
eyes rolled back in his head, as he fell to the mat. His breaths came short 
and shallow, as Crossbones leapt to the outside, taking a mic from the 
ringside area.

Crossbones: You ... Mark Blaze ... have defeated me. Though it was 
cheap ... though it was a false victory ... you still hold a victory over me. I 
truly thought you might be the one that was destined to defeat me. That is 
why I came back. To test you. To see if you were truly worthy. But Blaze ... you 
failed. As I let you land blow after blow, I came to realize the truth. 
You are nothing. You will forever be nothing ... or you will cease to be at 
all!

With that said, Crossbones dove back into the ring, staring at the 
downed body of Mark Blaze. Crossbones' eyes seemed to burrow a hole into his body, 
as he pulled him to his feet. Tugging his hair, almost pulling it from his 
scalp, Crossbones began to yell into his face, the breath of the undead 
washing over the face of Mark Blaze. There was now a pool of blood that 
had dripped from Blaze's nose in the center of the ring, dripping 
constantly. Then Crossbones sent a fist to the mouth of Mark Blaze, blood spewing 
to the outside. The scene in the ring was that of utter chaos, as shot after 
shot was sent to Mark's face. Then Crossbones wrapped his arms around 
Blaze's waist, hoisting him into the air, planting him to the mat in a perfect 
belly-to-belly. Then, jumping to the top rope, Crossbones leapt off, 
landing a Sternum Splash, leaving the fans in awe! Mark Blaze  was now just a 
husk of a wrestler. Blood dripped from his nose, teeth were now gone, and 
internal bleeding was a possibility. Then, dropping to one knee, 
Crossbones began to mumble. First a simple whisper, slowly growing louder and 
louder. Eventually, he was screaming strange phrases at the top of his lungs, 
as the lights begun to disappear, replaced by a crimson glow. Then ... there 
was a flash. A bolt to be more direct. From the heavens, a solid bolt of 
light seemingly struck the body of Blaze, causing him to burst into flames! 
The crowd was in shock, as Crossbones merely stared at the burning flesh. 
The ref turned, his face flushed by the sight, as he called for the bell. 
Obviously not willing to wait for someone to give up, he listened as the 
bell rung, men tossing buckets of water on Blaze. Crossbones' face was 
lined with both disgust and appreciation of the sight, as he merely stayed on 
one knee. As the men dragged Mark Blaze's limp, destroyed body from the 
ring, Crossbones began to smile, as the ref handed him the .Com championship, 
the ring announcer prepared to make the announcement.

Ring Announcer: The winner of this contest ... and NEW OWF 2000 .Com 
cham 
...

Crossbones suddenly ripped the mic out of the clutches of the 
announcer, shoving him hard to the mat. Then, he began to speak.

Crossbones: As I said before ... you are not the one who was destined to 
beat me in the ring ... as I have proven once again. Blaze ... I merely 
gave you a taste of what my brother is going to experience at Back in 
Business. 

Now that I am once again in posession of this title, the match that 
night will truly be in all it's glory. So brother ... I ask you this. Are you 
prepared ... to do the impossible?!

Then, dropping the mic, Crossbones walked from the arena, holding his 
.Com championship belt high above his head, the cheers of the crowd 
energizing him, as he pushed past the ring curtains.

And the Winner is:  Crossbones, the new .COM champion!
