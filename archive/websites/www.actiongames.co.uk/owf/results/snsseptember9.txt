record.  But tonight, the Tag Team titles are on the line
as Bail and Marasmus team up against two new guys, Kirk Storm
and HTK.  Plus, Bloodshed, a new member, is fighting Valek for
his newly gained .ORG title.  Then extreme reaches new levels

--------------------------------------------------------
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



****************************************
(((The crowd that paid 2 dollars for these highly coveted OWF 2000 seats 
are counting the seconds until the show starts...finally Mike walks to 
the ring.)))

Mike: Whadup everyone, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you all.  The
show has been cancelled.  Yep, that's right, I am really sorry.  

(((crowd starts booing)))

Mike: Hey hey hey, you only paid two dollars, don't act like I jipped you.

(((crowd boos more)))

Mike: Fine...do you really want the event?

(((crowd cheers)))

Mike: No, I don't think you understand, do you REALLY want this event?

(((crowd is standing and goes nuts.)))

Mike: (laughing))) Well ok then, I guess I can arrange it. Bring out the
first match!

(((crowd goes crazy and sits back down, alot calmer)))

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 1: Bloodshed V. Valek -For the .ORG title
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barry:  Well folks, sorry for that false alarm by Mike, we know that this
show will go on, but anyways, our first match here is an interesting one
and allthough this is only our second event it holds quite a bit of 
history around it.  Last Tuesday, Valek faced Neo for this title, and 
almost murdered Neo, now isn't it quite ironic that his next event just
happens to be a convicted Murderer?  I'll let you decide.

Johnny: Oh god, just shut the hell up, no one wants to listen to your 
hole.  But anyways, tonight does happen to be quite a hardcore night
on the count of there are two hardcore matches, and we are starting with
this one.  I love these matches.

Barry: They are extremely entertaining, what? Oh, this just in, Bloodshed
has asked Mike if weapons could be placed in the ring, Mike has agreed, 

(((Ringside attendants bring out all sorts of weapons to the ring)))

Johnny: Tight, now let's bring out the contestants!.....Dammit, NOW!

(((Spiders by System of a Down comes on and The lights go black.  Spot
lights fly all over the arena and finally center on Valek.  Under the 
light Valek looks so odd with his pale skin and enourmous size.  He goes
to the middle of the ring, grabs a chair, and waits for the challanger
to come to the ring)))

(((Smoke infests the arenea, on the THX screen jail bars open up and 
Bail comes out.   He walks to the middle of the ring as helicopter and
police sounds are being made.  The crowd boos alot.  He flicks all them
off.  When he get's in the ring he spits at Valek's feet.  The lights 
come on.)))

Barry: Oh come on, that just wasn't necessary.

Johnny: Do you really care?  I don't.

Valek takes his chair and slams it in Bloodshed's head.  A few trickles
of blood spout from Bloodshed's forehead.

Barry: Look!  Bloodshed is shedding Blood!

Johnny: Dude, that was lame.

Bloodshed slowly get's up as Valek looks for his next weapon. He grabs 
his head and looks at the blood coming out.  He smiles, but you can tell
that there is more going on inside his head.  He grabs a metal bat, while
Valek just picked up a wooden 2x4.  Valek goes for another shot to the 
head but Bloodshed ducks.  Valek threw so much weight into that swing he 
falls out of the ring.  Bloodshed jumps over the ring with the bat and
he tries to hit Valek in Mid-air, but Valek takes the wooden plank and
it breaks, but slows the bat down to the point of no concern.  

Barry: Great stuff, these guys risk it all.

Johnny: Come on, get a friggin new line.

Barry: Why don't you get a new gimmick.

Johnny: what the hell is that supposed to mean.

Barry: Nothing...

Johnny: gay...

Valek grabs the bat from Bloodshed and throws it away.  Bloodshed punches
Valek and Valek punches Bloodshed.  They exchange punches all the way up 
the ramp.  At the top of the ramp Valek grabs Bloodshed and tries to get
a piledriver off but Bloodshed throws Valek over his shoulders.

Barry: Excellent, That was extremely hard to do, because Valek is huge.

Johnny: NO!  really?

Valek then gets up, shakes it off.  Bloodshed goes for a rock bottom type
move but Valek turns it into a DDT.  Valek picks up Bloodshed.   
Marasmus then runs out and punches Valek from the back of the head over
and over.  Valek let's go of Bloodshed and walks to the side to shake it
off.  Blooshed then looks up at Marasmus, Bloodshed is really bleading 
now and can hardly walk.  Marasmus "helps" him over to the edge of the
ramp and does a suplex where Bloodshed falls 20 feet down to a few 
concession tables, if not for them Bloodshed would have fallen on the 
concrete and seriously been in trouble.  Valek then throws Marasmus over 
the edge, but Marasmus falls reletivly on his feet and looks up at Valek, 
Marasmus then runs away.  

Johnny: Great stuff, this is what I like.

Barry: But why does Marasmus need to interfere?

Johnny: Because he is cool, now shut up.

Valek jumps down onto Bloodshed, refs run down there and do the count.
1......2.......3....And Valek keeps his .ORG title.  

Barry: So Valek wins but barely fair.  Oh well, I think Valek still had
a great chance at winning this, just based on experience, but you can
bet your ass we haven't seen the end of Bloodshed.

Bloodshed get's up and walks away with the help of two referees.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the Winner is:  Valek, the defending .ORG champion. 
********************************************************
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 2: Purple Haze Vr. Lightning - Rooftop Match
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barry:  Well that match was crazy.

Johnny: Oh yeah Bar.  It was just CRAZY...retard.

Barry: Well anyways, this next event is between Purple Haze and Lightning, 
but as you can see, no one is in the ring and nor will anyone be there this 
match, this match is on the roof, and I can tell you, the roof of an arena 
has some pretty rough places to fight, every move hurts that much more 
because it's all concrete, these roofs aren't made for wrestling.

Johnny: really? NO...

Barry: Well let's go up there now.

(((the camera goes to the roof where Lightning is standing, waiting for 
Purple Haze to show up.  there are about 5 refs because of the danger 
that could result in this kind of match.  Then a purple helicopter comes 
over the roof and Purple Haze drops out of it.)))

Purple Haze then kicks lightning and the battle begins, they lock up and 
throw  each other in opposite directions.  Lightning hits a ventilation 
thing made of metal and grabs his back, while Purple Haze fell off the 
edge!

Barry: No, god no.

Johnny: I understand why you would be angry, I always knew you had a thing 
for him...

Lightning shakes it off and looks over the edge of the roof.  Luckily 
enough for Purple Haze there was one of those window washer things.  
Lightning jumps down on it.

Barry: This is nuts, they are fighting on a 15x7 foot plank, this is so 
dangerous, plus it is only connected by ropes!

Johnny: Of course the word you use is nuts...

Purple Haze and Lightning exchange punches an the thing starts to shake 
towards the building and away from it.  They bust through a window of 
the top floor CEO of the building's office.   Purple Haze falls off the 
edge of the plank, while Lightning falls into the CEO office saftely.  
Obviously the cameras all focu on Purple Haze who is hanging on by his 
bare hands over a thousand feet over the road below.  He doesn't try to 
pull himself up basically because it was too risky because the plank is 
still shaking, finally it settles down and he pulls himself up and jumps 
through the broken glass into the office, 

Barry: Did you see that!?!  Marasmus just ran out the door!

Purple Haze walks in, looks around and finds Lightning beat to a bloody pulp.  
He looks around and goes for the pin.  A ref sprints in the door and does 
the count- 1.....2......3  and Purple Haze won!

And the Winner is: Purple Haze!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 3: Bail and Marasmus V. HTK and Kirk Storm for the Tag Team Titles
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barry: The next match is between Bail and Marasmus V. HTK and Kirk Storm.

Johnny: Yep, and there is quite the history with Marasmus and HTK, 
them recently being at each other's throwts bacause of this match mainly...
something that is pretty common between us, huh Bar?

Barry: It doesn't have to be like that between us Johnny.

Johnny: Are trying to hit on me or something?  Damn!  (moves his chair away 
from Barry some more.)

(((With no cue Bail walks out to the ring and grabs a mic.)))

Bail: Marasmus, get your ass out here, where have you been!

(((after a few seconds Marasmus comes running out)))

Marasmus: Sorry man, I needed to handle some CEO stuff, now come on, let's 
win this thing!

(((The lights go out and HTK and Kirk Storm Walk out with a combination
of both of their entrances)))

Marasmus and Bail shake hands, they don't know who is going to start, so 
Marasmus just dives out of the ring.  HTK starts in with Bail.  Bail 
charges him and goes for a spear type move, but misses.  Bail get's right 
back up with a greeting of a punch to the nose.  HTK puts him in a headlock
but Bail get's out and reverses it to a leg sweep where HTK falls to the 
ground right on his face.  Bail goes to a rope and tries to do a mini 
moonsaults but misses and lands on his knees.  He bounces around in pain
for a little bit.  Bail gets up and HTK does a body slam to him.

Barry: Ouch.

Johnny: I am sick of you.

Bail gets up yet again and gets some momentum.  He punches left, punches
right, punches left, punches right, the ref warns him of a close fist and
Bail just ignores it, left, right, left, right.  HTK falls right into
Kirk Storm's hand and Kirk Storm jumps in the ring anxious.  He does a 
belly belly suplex on Bail and starts jumping with his knees on Bail.  
Bail starts grabbing his chest.

Barry: this could be dangerous!

Johnny: oooo, I'm shaking in my pajamas...

As Kirk Storm goes for another knee drop Bail grabs the knee and throws it
right into the ground, Kirk Storm grabs his knee in alot of pain.  Bail goes
over and tags Marasmus, and then goes to the top rope and lands a flip right
on Kirk Storm while Marasms shoves Bail out of the way and goes for the pin.
1...........2.. and Kirk Storm kicks out.  Bail is cheering on Marasmus from the
side of the ring.  Marasmus does a Samoen Drop to Kirk Storm.  Kirk Storm starts
crawling for HTK.  Bail runs over and pulls HTK out of the way and to the ground, 
does a knee drop on him, spits in his face and runs to his side before the ref
notices it.

Barry: Hahaha, it looks like HTK knows how it feels now! 

Johnny: (sarcastically) no...really?

Marasmus picks up Kirk Storm and lands the Marasmic and goes for the pin. 1....
......2.........3!  And Marasmus and Bail are the first OWF 2000 Tag Team 
Champions! 

And the Winner is: Marasmus and Bail, the new Tag Team Champions
****************************************************************
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 4: Piranha Vr. Angel
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johnny: Finally, time for a REAL match!

Barry: And you can bet its going to be a 

Johnny: Slobberknocker?

Barry: Uh, I was going to say  great.

Johnny:Oh, great is almost as bad as Slobberknocker...gay...

Barry: Well Angel made his way into the ring during the commercial break. Lets 
bring out The Piranha.  By the way, we would like to say "Tampax Tampons 
provide much better protection because of their stayfree wing glide-"

Johnny: Oh my god, I knew it...what the hell are you talking about!

Barry: I read the teleprompter, nothing more, nothing less...

Ring Announcer: And his opponent. From Regina, Canada. THE PIRANHA.

(The Piranha makes his way into the ring. DING! DING! DING!)

Barry: We are underway. The Angel and Piranha are staring each other down.

Johnny: Come on, somebody hit the other.

Barry: Angel swings a right hand and The Piranha but it is blocked. The Piranha 
respondes with heavy right hand of his own. There's another, and another! 
The Angel is thrown into the corner of the ring.

(The Piranha climbs up the ropes and gives Angel another 10 shots. Angel goes 
down. The crowd goes wild.  Piranha goes to the side and starts doing a little
canadian jig, if there is such a thing.......(Mike's note--good thing this is
only text, I think I would puke if I saw a canadian jig.....))

Barry: The Piranha should be attacking. He is taking his time up there on the 
top rope.

(Piranha tries to give Angel a leg drop from the top rope but Angel gets out 
of the way and Piranha is down.)

Johnny: Ha Ha Ha. I love it. Nobody likes a showboat.

Barry: Angel is in complete control now. 

(Angel then does a drop kick to get Piranha almost knocked out.  He goes to the 
top rope and attempts from the heavens, a 360 deegree spin with a flip, and lands
it!  He looks up to the stands and then walks around Piranha for a little)

Johnny: What an idiot... I swear, we have to friggin idiots in the ring tonight.?

Barry: Wait a minute, The Piranha is back up.

Johnny: Of course you would notice that Piranha is back up...you are probably thanking
god that the man of your dreams is getting up....

(The Piranha comes up behind Angel, rolls him up in a small package and the ref does the
count 1..........2..........3!  And Piranha wins!)

Johnny: No! The Piranha was holding his tights.

Barry: No he wasn't. The Piranha is victorious here tonight. But what I want to know 
is who is that guy up there in the stands? He cost Angel this match I think.  Also, 
I am a little curious at how Angel didn't really try to get out of that pin...

Johnny: Maybe we will find out on Tuesday.

Barry: Good night everyone, that's our show, tune in for the main night of the week on
Tuesday!  Cya all later...we're outie.

Johnny: outie, how frickin gay...


And the Winner is:  Piranha
