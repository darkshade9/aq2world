<p>The following news comes from mSparks, developer of the ltktdbm bot.
<br>
<br><span class="small">Quote:</span><br><span class="quote">&quot;ltktbm is shortly becoming AQ2 LTKTBM Edition. This means you dont need any installation of aq2 or quake 2 to play, you get a powerfull new gfx and sound engine and of course the single player aspect of the ltktbm bots, along with the proven playability of AQ2.
<br>We currently have an internal test release floating around and I have just released a patch to fix a few issues, We&#39;re getting very close to being complete, so, if anyone is interested in helping test before we release head on over to <a href="http://ltktbm.moddb.com" target="_BLANK" class="pagelink">The website</a> and keep an eye out for new news, I&#39;m hoping to get a mirror up for the 55MB alpha install ASAP.&quot;</span><br></p>

<p><a name='74'></a><span class="title">LTK/TBM Released</span><span class="small">&nbsp;&nbsp;by smurphster at 18:42:45 GMT</span></p>
<p>mSparks has been working hard on his new project he calls The Borg Matrix (TBM). His long-term goal is to improve LTK bots. The current alpha version actually makes the bots less intelligent but don&#39;t brush this off. The new dll is far more stable than LTK 1.22 and has some added features that make running an LTK server sensible. You can now set how many clients are on the server (similar to Unreal Tournament) OR you can set how many bots to stay on each team. I am currently running a test server for the bots. The address is: smurph.dnsalias.com.
<br>
<br>Along with the first release, mSparks has also released improved route files and an application that compiles the files for you (the game will also compile these). Currently all of popuPak is supported but more maps are on their way. If you have old .ltk files, this program will compile them too (or the game will compile them but this takes several minutes). Head on over to the <a href="http://www.cam-direct.co.uk/ltk/ltknews.shtml" target="_BLANK" class="pagelink">LTK/TBM site</a> and have a look for yourself.</p>

<p>The boys at <a href="http://aqmd.action-web.net" target="_BLANK" class="pagelink">AQMD</a> released Murder 2 by FiReWaLKeR on Tuesday. I ran through the map and, although I think FiReWaLKeR could do better, the map is definitely the quality I like to see. So head on over to <a href="http://aqmd.action-web.net" target="_BLANK" class="pagelink">AQMD</a> and have a look.</p>

<p>Idle from <a href="http://aqmd.action-web.net" target="_BLANK" class="pagelink">AQMD</a> received word that FiReWaLKeR[TDm] (creator of Murder) is currently working on Murder 2. Most AQ2 players are fans of the original Murder so after years of waiting, Murder 2 is a short way down the road. It will be another city map but don&#39;t frown, everyone is expecting it will live up to the original Murder which was far from the ordinary city map. For more information, visit <a href="http://aqmd.action-web.net" target="_BLANK" class="pagelink">AQMD</a>.</p>

<p><a name='9'></a><span class="title">Apologies for downtime</span><span class="small">&nbsp;&nbsp;by G.Bloke at 21:07:06 GMT</span></p>
<p>Early on Friday morning a hard drive in the web-server failed causing major corruption of many files including some of the backups. 
<br>
<br>For that reason over last 48+ hours our hosts have been restoring what they can from the drives and re-establishing the data on a new server. This process has taken a long time because of the number of accounts affected and the severity of the damage. Whilst all of the actiongames files have been restored to normal, thanks in part to a well design database backed administration system (/me pats himself on the back) we&#39;ve still had to wait for subdomains and other minor problems to be fixed. 
<br>
<br>I&#39;m very sorry that during this time you&#39;ve been unable to access the site, I&#39;m hoping that now we are on a brand new server the problems will be a thing of the past. If however they persist, for everyones benefit, I will seek hosting elsewhere.</p>
