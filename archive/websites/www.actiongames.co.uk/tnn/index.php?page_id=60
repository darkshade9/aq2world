<p class="title">Windows 98
Second Edition Updates</p>

<p><span class="standard">Everybody complains that Windows is full of
bugs but surprisingly few people do anything about it. Microsoft is
constantly releasing patches and updates that either fix something
that was broken or improve Windows' general
functionality.</span></p>

<p class="title">Microsoft
Windows Update</p>

<p class="standard">If you open the 'Start' menu and look under
'Settings' you will see an item labelled 'Windows Update...', click
on this and you'll be taken to the update website (you must be
connected to the internet).<br>
Click the button on the left that says 'Product Updates'. Your
computer will check to see what updates it already has installed
(this may take a few minutes) then a list will appear showing you
which updates are available for download, the list will be split
into catagories to help you find what you need.<br>
To download an item from 'Windows Update' find the one you want and
mark the check box to the right, then click the 'Download' button
at the top of the page and follow the instructions for download and
installation. You can download more than one item at a time by
having more than one box marked when you click 'Download', a few
items however must be downloaded seperately for varying reasons
(you will be told when this is the case).</p>

<p class="standard">The updates listed above are what I recommend but you
should also take a look at what else is on offer and download
anything else that you think may be of use to you.<br>
Be sure to check the 'Windows Update' site once a month so that you
can download any new updates that may be of benefit.</p>

<p class="title">Additional
Windows 98 Second Edition Updates</p>

<p class="standard">There are one or two more updates available elsewhere
on the Microsoft website that can help improve Windows. Note that
the order listed below is the order I recommend you install them
in. You may find that some of these upgrades fail to install giving
you an error message such as 'This upgrade was not designed for you
version of Windows'. This simply means that the upgrade has already
been installed by another program and you should not worry about
it.</p>

<p class="title">Updating
Your Modem Drivers</p>

<p>There are two things to consider when you update your modem:<br>
</p>

<ol>
<li>What standard does it use? (56k modems only)<br>
</li>

<li>Are the drivers up to date?<br>
</li>
</ol>

<p>There are three different standards for 56k modems (A standard
is simply 'a way your modem does things'), they are K56Flex, X2,
and V.90. X2 and K56Flex were the first standards that came out and
were used for quite a while before the industry decided that it
needed one unified standard so they created the relatively new
V.90. Most good ISPs will still support K56Flex, less will support
X2 but it's still quite popular, any ISP with a company value
higher than it's subscription charge will support V.90. If your ISP
does not support your standard you can still use them but your
modem will only be running at 33.6k (This is obviousley
unacceptable). Fortunately most reasonably new modems can be
upgraded from X2 or K56Flex to V.90 through a processes called
firmware upgrading (Contact your modem manufacturer to see if yours
can be upgraded).<br>
Firmware upgrading involves obtaining a patch from your modem
manufacturer (either from their website or by contacting them),
this will usually take the form of a small program that you run and
select the options for your upgrade.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;color:#FF0000;">Please note
that due to the vast variety of modems out there I cannot help you
with individual modem upgrade programs.</p>
<p>Be sure to follow
any instructions that come with the program PRECISELY, carrying out
this procedure dose bring with it a risk that your modem may be
permanently damaged by the firmware (This is not common but I have
seen it happen), if this happens you have no choice but to buy a
new modem (Make sure you buy a V.90 one this time). Finally,
whatever standard you use contact your ISP to see if they have
seperate phone numbers specifically for modems of your standard, if
they do there is a chance it will improve your connection
speed.</p>

<p>You should check your modem manufacturer's website to see if
there are drivers newer than yours and if so, download them. Some
will come with a special installation program but most will just be
a bunch of files that you have to extract to a temporary directory
then install through windows, if yours are the latter type follow
these instructions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Extract the files to c:\drivtemp\<br>
</li>

<li>Open the 'System' control panel.<br>
</li>

<li>Under the 'Device Manager' tab click the plus next to
'Modems'.<br>
</li>

<li>Select you modem and click 'Properties'.<br>
</li>

<li>Under the 'Driver' tab click 'Update Driver'.<br>
</li>

<li>Click 'Next'.<br>
</li>

<li>Tell windows to search for a new driver and click 'Next'<br>
</li>

<li>Unmark the top three boxes and mark 'Specify A Location'.<br>
</li>

<li>Type C:\drivtemp\ into the box and click 'Next'<br>
</li>

<li>Click 'Finish'.<br>
</li>

<li>Click 'Close' from the modem properties window.<br>
</li>

<li>Click 'Close' from the 'System' control panel.<br>
</li>

<li>Restart the computer.</li>
</ol>

<p class="title">End</p>

<p>Your PC is now up to date, you can now go on to <a href=
"index.php?page_id=59">tweak your connection settings.</a></p>
