<p class="title">Update</p>

<p>Robbie Boy and many of the staff have since moved on. The site
will continue to exist for as long as possible. Small updates and
news will still be made by new staff members and volunteers while
they are interested.</p>

<p class="title">About this site</p>

<p>This site has been designed to help all of those new to Action
Quake 2. &nbsp; I am hoping that this site will take off, but for
it to do so, I am relying on feedback from all of you guys and
gals. &nbsp; This is your site, so help me out from time to time by
sending me suggestions, constructive criticism or whatever you
like. &nbsp; Hopefully I will be able to reply to each and every
mail I receive, at least that's what I would 'like' to do. &nbsp;
Time will tell!</p>

<p>I'm hoping that you will all find lots of helpful information
and useful downloads that will get you started in Action Quake 2.
&nbsp; So, when you are ranked number 1 in the world, you'll think
back and say "God, I'm glad someone went to the trouble of making
that site!".</p>

<p>It will take a little while before everything is running
smoothly here, but the updates will be regular, and the <a href=
"/tnn/">news</a> page will keep you informed of any changes.</p>

<p>Respectfully</p>

<p>Robbie Boy</p>

<p class="title">Credits</p>

<p>The following people have all contributed and made the Newbie's
Niche what it is.&nbsp; With out there help and support we couldn't
have done this.</p>

<p class="title">RobbieBoy</p>

<p>When I looked at this page and saw what RobbieBoy had written I
noticed that there was one thing missing, being the modest bugger
that he is he hadn't put his own name down. Well, I'm now
correcting that error. RobbieBoy is the person responsible for The
TNN website, the AG website and the TNN clan, as well as for
bringing us together. He's currently working on various areas of
the site but mainly the LTK section churning out an enormous amount
of route files and he has in fact recently arranged for TNN to be
the official LTK route depot. He's held us together through the
good and the bad and without him the Niche simply would not be here
today.<br>
RobbieBoy, we salute you.<br>

<p class="title">Moonman</p>

<p>Warren started his career at the Niche by joining the clan, I
remember the email!&nbsp; During my 'departure' period, Warren took
over control of The Newbies Niche, and also the ActionGames site,
and helped many other people start new sites.&nbsp; His continued
WebMastering of TNN, and his work running the TNN clan are a great
asset to this site, I'm not sure how much he realises it, but his
work here is massively appreciated by myself.</p>

<p class="title">Rincewind</p>

<p>Chris again started off as a clan member, he proved himself to
be a very honest and trustworthy member of our group, and currently
runs the Discussion Zone at the Niche.&nbsp; Chris has a great
quality of bring calm and sense to many heated discussions, showing
us young 'uns the errors of our way - or me at least!</p>

<p class="title">_Robbie_</p>

<p>Robbie came out of the blue!&nbsp; We met in a NG one day and
laughed over the confusion caused by our similar names!&nbsp;
Robbie made us an offer to do our artwork, and I jumped at the
chance, I gave him some rough ideas of what I had in mind and
within a couple of days there were 6 logo's to choose from.&nbsp;
Since then, he has created more buttons and logo's for the site,
and in my opinion is a fantastic artist.</p>

<p class="title">G.Bloke</p>

<p>Another clan member turned site staff!&nbsp; Stuart has taken
over the downloads on the Niche as well as the server information
pages, he has also written some code recently to improve the
efficiency of the automated pages.&nbsp; Another asset to the
site.</p>

<p class="title">Japes</p>

<p>Jon runs the Map side of things here at the Niche, he also
Moderates the Maps forum at the Discussion Zone.&nbsp; Along with
his ongoing work at the Niche, he is also author of the "to be
released" map 'CarPark', currently under testing at the AQMD.&nbsp;
Nice one.</p>

<p class="title">[8]</p>

<p>And another one!&nbsp; Sean has recently taken over the 'Guides'
at the Niche, as well as incorporating the new 'Tweaks'
section.&nbsp; Lots of hard work has been put into this area of the
site, Sean's even made it a separate section from the main site
with it's own logo and news!&nbsp; Good work mate.</p>

<p class="title">Crimead</p>

<p>Ryan currently works on the LTK section at the Niche with
myself.&nbsp; He kept the section operational whilst I was a.w.o.l,
and kept the route files available and up together.</p>

<p class="title">Optrex</p>

<p>Mike wrote our original 'Lan Guide', a fantastic piece of work,
covering all that was needed to set up your own servers for
AQ2.&nbsp; From there Mike took over the Map Voting and Map
Downloads sections of the site.&nbsp; Through thick and thin Mike
has been there for me offering help and advice, and spotting many
of my broken links and typo's!</p>

<p class="title">Tradegy Trousers</p>

<p>Erik wrote the original guides section for the Niche.&nbsp; It
was aimed at helping both the newbie and veteran AQ2 players.&nbsp;
He also kept the server information up to date by checking the
various AQ servers, and made general announcements to the NG's.</p>

<p class="title">Rabid</p>

<p align="left">Rabid is the creator of 'FireTeams'.&nbsp; It all
started in a NG discussion, and within days there was a new mod for
AQ.&nbsp; Rabid's 'FireTeams' site is hosted at the Niche, and
although there hasn't been many updates recently, Rabid has worked
hard on his project.</p>

<p class="title">And all the others.........</p>

<p align="left">There are also many other people who have offered
advice, support and ideas to the Newbie's Niche to which we thanks
them all.&nbsp; And to the visitors to this site, thank you for
your continued support, with out you, this site would not be.</p>
