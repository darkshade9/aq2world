<p class="title">LTK Installation</p>

<p>The following should be enough information to help you install
the LTK Bot on your computer. I will assume that you are using a
Windows orientated operating system, as most users of the LTK Bot
do.</p>

<p>The first thing you will need is the actual LTK Bot <a href=
"http://files.actiongames.co.uk/tnn/ltk/client/ltk122.zip">
download</a>, which you may get from us (now that we are
official!).</p>

<p>The next thing you will need to do is unzip the file once it's
finished downloading. You will need an 'unzipper' such as <a href=
"http://www.winzip.com" target="_top">WinZip</a>.</p>

<p>I would suggest that you don't unzip the files directly into
your AQ2 directory for now, instead, unzip them into a temporary
directory on your desktop for example.</p>

<p>Explore the new directory, you will see the following files,
below are their descriptions;</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier new;font-size:12pt;">
/Quake2/action/gamex86.dll</p>

<p>This is the heart and soul of the LTK Bot, this file replaces
your existing game86.dll (the one that was installed with AQ2)</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier new;font-size:12pt;">
/Quake2/action/bots/BAKasylum.cfg</p>

<p>This is an example bot configuration file for the Asylum map, it
tells AQ2 what guns and items to select for the LTK Bots (we'll
discuss these in the <a href="https://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.actiongames.co.uk/tnn/ltk/ltkconfig.shtml"
>configuration</a> section)<br>
</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier new;font-size:12pt;">
/Quake2/action/bots/BAKbotdata.cfg</p>

<p>This is the default bot configuration file that will be used on
every map if you don't create map specific one (as above, we'll
come to this in the <a href="https://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.actiongames.co.uk/tnn/ltk/ltkconfig.shtml" target=
"main">configuration</a> section later)</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier new;font-size:12pt;">
/Quake2/action/terrain/asylum.ltk<br>
 /Quake2/action/terrain/teamjungle.ltk</p>

<p>Both of the above files are known as route files, these files
tell the LTK Bot the layout of the map, and where items are, such
as ammo and guns. We'll cover route files in the <a href=
"/tnn/ltk/ltkconfig.shtml" >configuration</a>
section later. <a href="https://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.actiongames.co.uk/tnn/ltk/config.shtml" target=
"main"></a></p>

<p>These are the basics that need to be installed into your /action
directory, to be on the safe side, it is advised that you always
backup your existing gamex86.dll file, simply create a new
directory inside of your /action directory, call it 'backup' or
something similar that you'll remember. Once you have done this,
you can happily copy in the new gamex86.dll file, and also the 2
directories (and their contents), /bots and /terrain into your
/action directory.</p>

<p>As far as the installation goes, this is pretty much all you
need to do. However, you do only have 2 route files installed,
whilst you are in the mood for downloading and installing files, it
maybe worth getting a few more route files now from the <a href=
"/tnn/ltk/ltkabout.shtml" target="_top">LTK Depot</a>, pick a few of
the maps you like, download them, and unzip them straight into your
/quake2/action directory, all of the files from the <a href=
"/tnn/ltk/ltkabout.shtml" target="_top">LTK Depot</a> have been tested
and are safe.</p>

<p>So, you now have the LTK Bot installed on your system. Want to
give it a try, before you do, move on to the next section, <a href=
"/tnn/ltk/ltkusing.shtml" >Using LTK</a>.</p><br>
