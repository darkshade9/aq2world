<p class="title">Using the LTK Bot</p>

<p>This section may sound a little daft to some of you, for
example, how hard can it be to use right? Well, I figured as I was
writing all of the instructions out, it was better to explain
things so that someone completely new to AQ2 and also the LTK Bot, could pick it up, and jump straight in.</p>

<p>To use the LTK Bot, you basically just run AQ2 as before. There are some
things you can do to configure it for the better, see the <a href=
"/tnn/ltk/ltkconfig.shtml" >configuration</a>
section for details.</p>

<p>There are a couple of ways you can start a game using the
LTK Bots, I will show you one of the easy ways, which will be
quicker for you for future games</p>

<p>In windows, explore the /quake2 directory, click once on the
Quake2.exe file and create a shortcut icon to it (right click, and
choose 'create shortcut'). You will find it better to move this new
shortcut icon to somewhere easier to find, either on your desktop,
or add it to the list of programs on your 'start' button. Now
repeat this entire process, so that you end up with 2 shortcut
icons. Rename one of them to LTK DM, and the other to LTK TP (we
will configure them for both DeathMatch and TeamPlay games).</p>

<p>Once you have placed the shortcuts where you want them, you need
to change some of the information in it, so that it runs AQ2 and
the LTK Bots exactly how you want them. To start with we will set
the LTK DM shortcut up.</p>

<p>Right click on the shortcut icon, and click on properties, you
will then be presented with a window telling you about the
shortcut, click on the 'shortcut' tab.</p>

<p>You will see a field called 'Target', it should already have the
location of Quake2 in there, what you now need to do is add the
following text to the end of that line, leaving a space after
existing text.</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier new;font-size:12pt;">+set game action
+deathmatch 1 +maxclients 8 +map asylum +set ltk_skill 1</p>

<p>*Note : You can add which ever map name you wish to the end of
this, but to keep things simple, I've shown you how to run Asylum
as the .cfg file for the LTK Bots come with the download. You will also notice the
command on the end of the line, this will prevent you from being
completely slaughter, until you have got to grips with how the LTK Bot works.</p>

<p>Once you have added that text to the shortcut, click on OK, to
save the changes.</p>

<p>At this point you should now have a shortcut icon that will run
a game of AQ2 and put you and some LTK Bots into a DeathMatch game, so why not go give it a try.
Did it work? If so, good, we are on our way, if not, run through
the above again, and make sure you havent miss typed anything. If
you still cant get it running properly, then drop me an <a href=
"mailto:ltk@actiongames.co.uk">email</a>. After you've had a little
play against them, come back and we'll set up the next shortcut for
a TeamPlay game.</p>

<p>Ok, so you've now returned, hopefully amazed at what a good game
you've just played, and how you managed to win some rounds too!</p>

<p>Lets now set up a TP game.</p>

<p>Repeat the steps above, up to adding the text at the end of the
command line for the other shortcut you created. Use the text
below, remember to leave a space.</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier new;font-size:12pt;">+set game action
+set maxclients 8 +set deathmatch 1 +set teamplay 1 +map teamjungle
+set ltk_skill 1</p>

<p>*Note : Once again, I have added the skill setting to this
command line, just to give you a chance to get a feel for it, if
you are feeling a little cocky now, you could increase it, it
ranges from 1-10. I have also changed the map, asylum is a little
small and at close quarters for TP, so we are going to run
TeamJungle, the .cfg file for this is also included in the
download.</p>

<p>Again, click on OK to save the changes. You now have a second
shortcut that will run AQ2, drop some LTK Bots into a TP game. If you want to give it a try go ahead,
remember, with a TP game, you have to choose the team you want to
play on (refer to the Guides at the <a href=
"http://www.actiongames.co.uk/tnn" target="_top">Niche</a> for help
with this if needed). Remember, if you have any problems, then
re-check what you've typed in, spelling mistakes are easily made.
If you are sure you've done everything as above, and you still
arent having any fun, drop me an <a href=
"mailto:ltk@actiongames.co.uk">email</a>, and we'll get you up and
running.</p>

<p>That's basically all you have to do to use the LTK Bots. Once you've created these shortcuts you can use them
time and time again, changing the settings in them if you wish
to.</p>

<p>The longer way to do this would have been to type the commands
in at the console instead of using the shortcut icons. Both ways
work just as well, but the way I've shown you will save you having
to do it everytime you play.</p>

<p>In the next section <a href="https://assets.aq2world.com/archive/websites/www.actiongames.co.uk/tnn/ltk/ltkconfig.shtml">LTK Configuration</a>, we will show you how to set up
even more settings to make the game even better.</p><br>
