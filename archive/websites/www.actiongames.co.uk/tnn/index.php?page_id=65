<p class="title">LTK Configuration</p>

<p>Ok, so you've read the <a href=
"/tnn/ltk/ltkinstall.shtml" target=
"main">Installation</a>, and the <a href=
"/tnn/ltk/ltkusing.shtml" >Using</a> section, and
every other line referred you to here! What's so special about this
section, well, I'll tell you, this is where you will learn the in's
and out's of what you can do with the LTK Bot.</p>

<p>We have already shown you a quick way to set up both a DM and TP
game using the shortcut icons in Windows. The next thing that we
should show you is how to customise what the
LTK Bot's will carry in the game with them, with respect to
weapons and items.</p>

<p>The way we do this is by creating .cfg files, and placing them
into the /Quake2/action/bots directory. You will remember the
'BAKasylum' .cfg file that we talked about in the <a href=
"/tnn/ltk/ltkusing.shtml" >Using LTK</a> section
earlier. The LTK Bots will then use what ever guns and items you've selected
for them, but bare in mind, this is only setting what they actually
start with, once the game commences, if they run out of ammo, or
find a better weapon, they will drop what you selected for them,
and pick up something else!</p>

<p>First things first, explore the /Quake2/action/bots directory,
open the asylum.cfg file, using a text editor (on most systems, you
should just be able to double click the file, and either notepad or
wordpad will open it for you).</p>

<p>This is what you should be seeing (unless you've already changed
something);</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier new;font-size:12pt;">!1<br>
# Special config for the Asylum level<br>
# name, model/skin, team, weaponchoice, equipchoice;<br>
# Weaponchoice [1..5] MP5, M4, M3, HC, SNIPER<br>
# Equipchoice [1..5] SIL, SLIP, BAND, KEV, LASER<br>
# If teams then this is Team 1<br>
"FatGirl Slim", "female/venus", 1, 1, 4;<br>
"Killer Kombo", "male/cajin", 1, 1, 4;<br>
"Jackie Chan", "male/mclaine", 1, 1, 4;<br>
# Team 2 - Mix n Match<br>
"Kim DeVille", "sydney/sydney", 2, 4, 2;<br>
"Arnie Black", "male/commando", 2, 3, 1;<br>
"The Sarge", "male/grunt", 2, 5, 4;</p>

<p>So, what the hell does all this mean! Well, lets work through
it, line by line. The first line is very important, and although it
means nothing to you, if its not included, the file will not be
recognised by the
LTK code, always make sure its present. The next 5 lines
beginning with the # are comments, you can add as many of these as
you wish, it will not hurt, but neither really is it necessary to
add more. If you read these, you will realise the Connor Caple
(author of
LTK), has actually explained most of it for you here.</p>

<p>You just have to enter the information in the same format as its
already displayed, so lets just add another play for now to Team
1.</p>

<p>Create a new line somewhere, it doesnt matter where, but it
easier if you keep the players on Team 1 and Team 2 seperate, so
lets insert our new line after the line that begins - "Jackie
Chan".</p>

<p>Now add the following line;</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier new;font-size:12pt;">"Bill Gates", "male/mclaine",1,1,1</p>

<p>What has this just done, well, we've added a new player with a
name of "Bill Gates", we've given him the "male" model, and the
"mclaine" skin for that model. The first number that follows this
is the TEAM number, either 1 or 2, so here we have added Bill to
Team 1. The numbers that follow give Bill the MP5 (as decribed in
the comment line beginning with 'Weaponchoice' - number 1), and
rather cruely we've only given him a pair of slippers to defend
himself with - bad luck Bill! (as described in the 'Equipchoice'
comment line - number 1).</p>

<p>You could save this file now, and then run your TP shortcut, and
you should find that Team 1 now has an extra player to Team 2, and
his name is Bill. If you want a good laugh, watch them fight it
out, see how long Bill lives!</p>

<p>You can add as many extra players as you wish, and to either
team, just remember to get the quotation marks ( " ) aroud the
players name, and also around the model/skin that he/she will be
using. Also, ensure you seperate the number with comma's ( , ).</p>

<p>You dont have to have equal sized teams, you may have just one
LTK Bot on one team, and 10 on the other, but remember, if you
have lots of Bots in a game, you will more than likely need to
increase the 'maxclients' command in your shortcut.</p>

<p>*Note : If you want to play on your own verses the LTK Bots, with no other Bots on your team, this to can be done
easily, but not as you would probably imagine. What you cannot do,
is leave one team set with NO LTK Bots, so the only way to get around this is to do the
following.</p>

<p>Set up which ever team it is that you want to fight against,
lets say team 2. Then add 1 bot to team 1, give him a name that's
easy to remember, then when the game starts (just after the map
loads, but before you start fighting) type the following at the
console;</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier new;font-size:12pt;">sv_removebot BOTNAME where BOTNAME is the name of the LTK Bot you want to remove.</p>

<p>Below is a copy of a .cfg file I use, I also bound one of my
keys on my keyboard to remove the same LTK Bot at the touch of a button, which saves you having to
type it everytime, example;</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier new;font-size:12pt;">!1<br>
# NOTE: model/skin is only used in non-teamplay games!<br>
# name, model/skin, team, weaponchoice, equipchoice;<br>
# Weaponchoice [1..5] MP5, M4, M3, HC, SNIPER<br>
# Equipchoice [1..5] SIL, SLIP, BAND, KEV, LASER<br>
# Team 1 - RobbieBoy's gang!<br>
"[Mr]Deleted", "terror/skyterr",1,5,5;<br>
# Team 2 - The Dogs!<br>
"[Mr]Orange", "terror/skyterr", 2, 5, 4;<br>
"[Mr]Black", "terror/skyterr", 2, 1, 4;<br>
"[Mr]White", "terror/skyterr", 2, 3, 4;<br>
"[Mr]Blue", "terror/skyterr", 2, 1, 4;</p>

<p>As you can see, I have only 1 LTK Bot on Team 1, I have then 4 Resevoir Dog gang members on
Team 2 (the names can be fun!). As soon as the game loads, I hit my
'D' key, which I gave the following bind;</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier new;font-size:12pt;">bind d sv_removebot [Mr]Deleted</p>

<p>This is very handy, and lets you play the round on your own
verses the LTK Bots.</p>
