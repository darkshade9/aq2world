<p>Since this is my first column, I&#39;ll provide a brief introduction to myself.  I&#39;m a Computer Science student living in the US.  I&#39;ll often be writing about general computer topics but I am also into gaming, which is why I&#39;m here.  I&#39;ve been staff here at AG for quite some time and it feels like home.  I&#39;m a rather opinionated person and often play the devil&#39;s advocate.  Please don&#39;t take my ramblings as the views of AG or even myself as I&#39;m rather scatter-brained at times.  With that in mind, here&#39;s what I have to say...
<br>
<br>Hardware continues to get better, software and games continue to get more and more complex, programmers continue to be out of jobs.  Why?  Answer that question for me and I&#39;ll be very very happy provided a solution comes with it.
<br>
<br>Why is it that we live in such a technology-driven world yet jobs are being lost in the very field that keeps technology going?  Cell phones and PDA&#39;s have more processing power and storage than my first PC.  I still have a PII 350 in my closet that runs linux like a charm yet people need that power in their hand.  In a class of mine we toyed with the idea of ordering pizza by only entering what toppings you want into your PDA.  The delivery man would find you via GPS and you would pay electronically of course.  The next day in class our professor presented to us an advertisement that was extremely close to our idea.  It&#39;s amazing how far technology has come and I&#39;m excited to see how far it will go in my lifetime.  That is why I&#39;m in school for Computer Science.
<br>
<br>There&#39;s this strange misconception about Computer Science majors.  Every time I tell people what my major is, they say &quot;well you won&#39;t have any problems finding a job&quot; as if it was common knowledge.  I just smile and nod but behind that smile is terror.  I&#39;m sure every other student in Computer Science or similar major gets the same reaction and has the same feelings.  I know far too many programmers out of jobs to be confident about my future.
<br>
<br>Now you&#39;ve probably noticed there are a lot of I&#39;s in the last paragraph.  Yes, this is a touchy subject for me, but I tell you this to introduce a point.  Where is technology going?  Everyone knows where it&#39;s been.  We once had great factories with hundreds of workers, now we have robots.  We need designers, programmers, mechanics, etc. for those robots.  Now programming jobs are becoming hard to find.
<br>
<br>Could our technology be becoming too smart?  Of course not, smart is better.  People don&#39;t want to think for themselves, they want a computer that fits in their pocket to do their thinking for them.  Computers are relatively stable and dependable compared to the brain.  They compute at a set rate and have few variables.  The brain is much more powerful yet has specialized functions.  It requires concentration and is prone to error.  Computers don&#39;t forget, &quot;learn&quot; instantly and will never forget what they&#39;ve learned.  Computers have the upper hand right?
<br>
<br>I don&#39;t want to go into a <span style="font-style:italic">(The) Matrix</span> &quot;AI is taking over the world&quot; rant, but it seems the progression is on its way to this.  Perhaps this concept was considered when making <span style="font-style:italic">The Matrix</span>.  However, this is not the aim of my ramblings.
<br>
<br>Coding has become efficient.  Algorithms and methods are being named, studied, and written in books for students.  Classes (objects) are being developed and extensively re-used on a company level and even sold between companies.  CASE tools and standards like UML are making the programming process streamline.  Some programming languages are at a very high level that someone knowing very little about programming could read the code and have an idea of what it does.  Point and click programming is a reality.
<br>
<br>Amazing.  Simply amazing.  These things will make my job easy yet is what horrifies every programmer.  Fewer programmers are needed and are easier to replace due to this extreme state of efficiency.  Yet we are still learning.
<br>
<br>With this efficiency, you&#39;d think more companies would spring up and companies would work on more projects.  It is extremely difficult, however, to start such a company since a new company can&#39;t offer the same price or efficiency as another experienced company.  Also, a new company has no name and customers have no idea how much quality to expect.  Customers want software that works, is fast, has all the bells and whistles, and most importantly will be online quickly and is cheap.  How can a new company with 3-4 programmers offer this?
<br>
<br>Our economy is still low.  Perhaps technology grew too fast.  Perhaps it&#39;s still growing too fast.  Was this growth the cause or effect of our economic state?  Perhaps a bit of research could answer that question but no amount research can tell us what to do now.
