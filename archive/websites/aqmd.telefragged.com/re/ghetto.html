      </font>I loved this map except for a few tiny things.. you have 2 sniper 

      guns in the map, it turnsit away from a hit and run type level to a sniping 

      parade which is alright if you can shoot with lag : ). The sky as well... 

      BORING I think a nice peacefun night sky with a moon and a bunch-o-stars 

      would make this a really nice quiet map! As for the map design and the fun 

      I would give it 2 thumbs up, GREAT job on this map... take my suggestion 

      into account and you got on of the best maps! <br>

<p><b>Review:</b><br>

  If you have read any of my other reviews you know by now that i quite enjoy 

  close clombat, shotgun blowing, knife slashing frag fests. Ghetto recreates 

  this very well, with a nice, tight (but not small!) level. 

<p> Basically Ghetto consists of the basic outdoor perimiter, anda four level 

  building with a ground level, two VERY room filled floors and a roof top. 

<p>The sheer number of rooms is what makes Ghetto fun. Since the mjourity of the 

  ammo and weapons are in these tiny rooms players are constantly going in and 

  out of them, resulting in intense, nerve wracking gunfights and equalizes the 

  the playing field by making my two favorite weapons, the shotgun and handcannon, 

  actually usesful! =) 

<p> Weapon placement is great, with, once again, an emphasis on close combat warfare 

  by stuffing two shotguns in the level. Ammo is abundant but sparse, so there's 

  no real abiltiy to camp in this level. 

<p> This level isn't execellent however, minor flaws keep it from becoming an 

  "Action Quake" classic like Hostage2 or Kumanru. First off the level is ugly. 

  Now I know it's a ghetto but the drab browns harken back to the days of Quake 

  1. Campers and snipers are at a serious disadvantge since you really can't hide 

  in this level, throwing that strategy right out the window. Also there's not 

  a lot of little details that makes this level seem like I'm running around Compton 

  (fun note: how the hell is there exepesive weaponary lying around a ghetto?) 

  As with most Action Quake maps i also get bad frames and poly break up druing 

  heated battles, damn I need a Voodoo 2! =) 

<p> These gripes however are minor however. This map is mad fun, esepecially for 

  those sick bastards who like to grab a shotgun and go "LA Confidential" on some 

  poor bastards knee caps. God knows i do =) <br>

  This level is Fun if you can get pass the slow framerates. What else hasn't 

  been said? Well there is Definitely sniper and camper spots here. Lots of them. 

  (hehe i'm not gonna tell you the details but I've gotten more than 12 frags 

  in a row with a pistol and silencer.) Just use your imagination. It is also 

  possible to get lots of points and have a blast by running door to door with 

  a shotgun. Don't stay in the walkways too long or you'll be sniped. <br>

<p> <b>Review:</b><br>

  Being an open space kind of guy, when I first saw this map I didn't think I 

  was going to like it: it seemed too simple and too tight. Well, I was wrong. 

<p> This map is a lot of fun and definitely not simple. Perhaps the appeal is 

  with the multitude of rooms, the sensation of being in this urban war zone, 

  and knowing the only way to survive is by being smart (or smarter than your 

  opponents at least) because you're not going to be able to hide (at least not 

  for long). 

<p> Gameplay and strategy depends on where you are - on the roof, going from room 

  to room, or down on the ground. Weapons placement and ammo seem well balanced; 

  even the M4 Wunderwaffe is counterbalanced by the fact that whoever has it is 

  still quite exposed and vulnerable to attack. 

<p>I get a fair amount of clipping with this map, yet it is still an enjoyable 

  map to play. <br>
