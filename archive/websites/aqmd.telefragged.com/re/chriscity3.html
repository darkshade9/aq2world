<b>Review:</b><br>





Before you read further, start downloading this one and then read on. This is one map you will like.

<p>Now, what is this map all about? It is a piece of a city, hence the name. But it is a little different than most of the better city-maps. This one differs because it is a piece of ground where different buildings are placed on. Not an sort of huge box where you wander around in (the walls being all buildings which some you can access) like colt_c or actcity for example. And that gives quite a different feel to this map. And I like it.

<p>

You will find two area's with buildings, connected through a nice bended tunnel. Buildings being a church, a few residents, a pool, a factory and an office building and there is also a sewer system underneath this all. You probably think: this map must be HUGE, I'll never find the other players, but here comes one of the things that makes this map rock:

<p>

All the interiors of the buildings are not too big. Let's have the 5 (!) storeys high office building for example. The elevator is covered in glass, so everybody can see from the outside where someone is going: easier to find your victim, and recuires some adjustments of tactics (great!). Then each floor is not so huge: only a few rooms. And although maybe this might not sound so important: I believe this prevents to map from becoming an all but long range shooting map. Close combat enough in all the interiors of the buildings, so the sawed-off KA-BOOM is quite a joy to use here =)

<p>

Okay, the PRO's:

Great design: it gives you the feeling to really wonder the streets, run around buildings and houses and accessing these. The map layout takes only a few minutes to get familiarized with. Textures are divers, with some "graffity" as well (must be the Forsaken part?). Nice touches: the way you can get on top of the factory, the inside of the factory, the "windows" you can open and close (providing great shooting positions as well as cover).

<p>

Gameplay: even with just a few players in it, this map can be a blast! It is not hard to find each other, because the interiors are not that big and you will find someone walking down the street soon enough. Nice balance too with the weapons: natural enemies placed relatively close to one another (sniper vs. MP5) and I think there has been done some thinking about the enviroment tributing to the balance as well. For example: THE most obvious snipe spot is the roof of the skyscraper, but it is fairly small (teach 'em how to fly I tell ya!) and there's huge fan blowing sound so snipers will not be able to use their ears to warn them if someone will access the roof as well.....=) The amount of detail is good: not too much and not it is not in the way. If you play with less than 4 players I think there's a little too much ammo, but I guess that's not where this map is made for...

<p>

Well, the CON's:

The sewer is a bit confusing (but then again: would a real sewer not be?) and the "graffity": some lame words about some playerdudes.... My opinion is that this is some cheap commercial to get your name known. Please do not do this ever again, mappers!!! It is easy done, but so weak, so cheap and gives me the impression that you hesitate about your yourself as a mapper. If you are a good mapper your name will be known, don't worry. Instead of this text-bits, have a copy af some cool, old school real graffity pieces and use these to add up the atmosphere. But that is all I think of as being bad about this map. Maybe it does run a bit slow if you do not have a fast connection and that would be a real negative thing about this map, but I haven't checked that yet.

<p>

The same goes for teamplay, but I think I have seen enough elements which should make this map a blast, if not one of the best: it should lend itself for very different styles of teamplay: stand your ground (a building: various to choose from or even defend a territory: each side of the tunnel), cleanup with your whole team, etcetera.

<p>

The bottom line: get it, you'll like it, it's action quake2 allright! I'm looking forward to more maps of Chris Polan!<br>

<b>Review:</b><br>



This is a map about two sides. A "dark" one and a "bright" one. Well the bright thing is about right but the dark side?? I think not. Being the first map of the author i think he got potentials, but he has to look a little bit more to the details, such as: a TV with a HUGE size, A lamp flooting inches from the ceiling, doors with hinges that work like sliding doors, and so on.

I like the elevator. Its cool to have an open elevator.

That's what i mean with details. use them more often.

<b>Review:</b><br>









All I could do for the new map 'chriscity3' was a solo walk though because no severs are currently running it.  I am extremely pleased with the layout of this map, and I can see that it will make an excellent teamplay map.  Basically this map is divided into two sections seperated by a road tunnel.  One section has a tall skyscraper type building with an excellently done elevator (complete with floor buttons), an odd building or some sort, and a small factory type establishment.  Also there is a sewer system that connects both sides of the map.  The other section of the map has a swimming pool, a quake church (great idea it's about time we worship quake for what it is!), and another odd building. My only complaint about the "odd buildings" is the lack of detail in the rooms.  The furinture looks toyish, and the beds are huge.  Also the TV's have lame Quake2 images on them.

Weapon placement is good.  The M4 is difficult to reach, but my only problem here is there is a little two much firepower.  I could be mistaken, but I believe I found two MP5s in this map and that could lead to problems in DM.  

Overall this appears to be a great map, and I hope servers add it to their rotation soon.  Download it now!

<b>Review:</b><br>





Hey all!!! Bobby the Rookie here, now known as "The Rookie"

now (awwwwwwww.... no more beastie boys reference) for clan reasons, but don't worry, I'm still the same old reviewer you have all come to know and love (insert sound of circkets here.)

<p>

Well Christcity is one cool map. Basically it plays on a "light side/dark side" sort of idea with an urban feel. There are tons of cool buildings and effects (esepcially that box on the conveyor that turns little to big.) While probably DM compatible i've never found a DM server to actually play it on, but judging from what I saw I suppose this could be  a decent DM map, just need a good number of people. 

<p>

This maps stregnth has to be team play. The match is huge, and has distiguishable buildings so strategy is easily comparable to Blockwar (one of my fave maps) The map accomdates a number of strategies, esepecially the often screwed snipers, giving them nice tall buildings to pick people off of while still being pretty much safe.

<p>

The look of the map is great. Textures fit the theme and the whole "light and dark" side is very cool. The design is complex and large, making it easy for games of less then 6 to be long drawn out battles. Considering the fact that there's a sewer system just makes this map even more complicated. 

<p>

Gripes: The map is a too big for small 3 on 3 encounters or even small DM matches. There are a few bugs (ie. elevators not working all the time.) The map's size and design can eaily lead to the camper mentality, being the fact that an entier team can hide in one room and wait for the other team to run in and mow em down (If anyone on the A-Team is reading this, i hope you make 1 more version of Action Quake that includes Tear Gas Grenades and/or Flash Bangs to eleveate this.)

<p>

Overall Christcity is a good map in the same vein that Blockwar is a good map. If you like big maps that require tema strategy this is a great map to pick up.

<b>Review:</b><br>





First off I'd like to say, download this map before you read any further...where have I heard that before?  =]

<p>

PLAYABILITY:

  The setup is perfect for teamplay or DM.  The only thing I noticed is that in multiplayer this level seems to lag up really easy.  Modem users beware.

Score: 9/10

<p>

GRAPHICS:

  The main building has several floors but each floor has only a few rooms on it so it makes it easy to find your opponent so you won't be running around looking for each other all day.  On the roof there is a little graffiti which is a good touch, but the author could have used something a little more gang related or something.  Not JoBOB rulez at Quake!

  The factory was very well done.  Thats all I have to say about that, except I'd like to diss the grafitti again.  =]

sorry God.<p>

  The church is nicely done with a cool quake alter.  The only thing I dislike about the church is the Doom graphic and the ferrari...those shoulda been left out.<p>

  Outside the church is a dark building with two rooms, the rooms are ok but the TV's contain lame graphics on the tubes, and the doors to the bathrooms have hinges but slide open?  I think a little more time shoulda been put into this building.  Also I noticed that the author made one of the pillows on the bed with a water texture.  Not good.

  The sewer system under the city is one of the best ones I've seen yet.  It's not too dark and not to hard to figure how to get out.  (Even though you may not come out the hole you like.)<p>

  Thats about all I can really critic the graphics on this map, overall I think it fits the AQ2 profile nicely.

Score: 8/10<p>



TEXTURES:

  No cartoony graphics that really stuck out except for that stupid Doom graphic, if you wanna see DOOM go play Doom 2 or sumthin.  Who is that guy in the picture with the Ferrari anywayz?  I don't care to see something that I will never have the money to buy so please leave personal stuff outta the maps, it would make the game more reallistic.  And that is the main purpose of AQ2, reallism.

SCORE: 8.5/10

<p>

OVERALL: 8.5/10

<b>Review:</b><br>







 I play tested this map for hours. Great fun, good r_speeds, and uhhh...fun! Did I already say that? It was hilarious, I managed to coax the whole server into the church and then I executed them while they were frantically trying to escape!

The coolest thing about this map is probably the elevator. There are 6 floors. But one thing about that that pisses me off is if your next to the wall with the buttons when the elevator is going up, it will squish you. It's damned fun camping on the roof with the sniper rifle/mp5 and blowing people away the moment the elevator door opens. To my dismay, most of the action occurs on the light side of the map, with the elevator and factory. I would like to see some more fights by the pool and in the church/clock tower. The sewers are pretty wierd, you see the water flowing one way but the current takes you another way. The m4 is located in an out of the way but fairly accessable location, on the crossbar in the factory. If you can't figure out how to get up there, you shouldn't be playing quake. The building is a snipers heaven, with nice sniping areas in almost all of the floors. And with only one way in, it is more difficult to kill them, but don't keep your back to the elevator for long, you might just get shot out of the window. Also, be careful when leaning over the edge on the roof, because one well placed shot will knock you off. Some unique features on this map, but pretty standard, and fun to play. I suggest you download this map.

<b>Review:</b><br>

This map is a great map to play in teamplay or DM.  It runs good on my p166 even and I don't even have a 3d card, so it must be a fast map on other machines.  I love the tall builidings and finally an extensive sewer system that has many manholes, for those of you who are of the stealthy ninja type.  I love the tunnel, and how the buildings are have many windows for great sniper battles.  It also isn't just a big box, it's more like a real life street.  Only draw back is the gay grafitti on the walls.  This shows some immaturity on the map makers part, and should be avoided in the future.  If you must use graffitti use a picture of some real graffity ok!  I like the church of Quake, which is just sort of funny.

<p>

Structure and Design -9/10- I love this design of a map.  The buildings aren't so large and extensive that they make finding people difficult.  It's very easy to know where you are by just looking at the building you're in.  The glass elevator is the first of it's kind, so I guess mad props to this map maker for thinking of it.  I like how the buidings are tall, but not large, so they can be searched very quickly.  Usually in teamplay the size of this map is not a problem, since it has enough places to hide for you campers, but not so many it could take hours to find that last guy.  If two people want to find each other on this map, the tall top of the tall buildings give a great view for finding him.  This is one of the first maps that is not a box, it feels more like a city street (if that isn't already boxy:)  

<p>

Gameplay -9/10-  I never really give 10's because for a 10 I have to immediately by "wowed"(This is my word I made up) to give a 10.  So this is a great score from me.  The buildings aren't huge, so the game goes by fast.  This map maker has a map that is fun for teamplay, because if you can organize one team defend one side of the tunnel and the other team, the other side, then you will become on with the sewer since you stealthy ninja backstabbers will have a chance to do some damage.

<p>

Textures -5/10-  The textures aren't all that good here.  The grafitty is crap, and there are some cartoonish textures.  They are decent, but aren't a great masterpiece like in blockway, where it is like WOW!  This shouldn't discourage anyone from playing it since it's still a very fun map.

<p>

How it runs -8/10-  Not really an expert here with my crappy machine, but if it runs descent on my slow connection/computer it should run good on a faster computer.  

<p>

Overall -8/10-  Very fun map, should be downloaded and be put on server rotations.  If I owned a server I would put this map on a regular roatation. The author of this map has great potential in this field and I hope he can make some more maps.  Download this map and go to a server that has it since you won't be disappointed.  It's good fun, and the bottom line is that it fits the action theme, it runs good and looks good and plays good. I hope that all authors of maps will be able to produce this caliber of map and better in the future.<p>

                      Happy Fragging, hunting, whatever<BR>
