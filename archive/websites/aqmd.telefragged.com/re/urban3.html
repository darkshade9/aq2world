<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>This is another awesome map in the Urban series. Even though the three of them all have huge similiarities, each has characteristics that make them unique. In Urban3, many people would look at it for the first time and think &quot;this map is catered to campers.&quot; Yeah, that's only if you're a rusher with his thumb up his ass. I was playing this map against a team of two SGG toters, and I wasted them plenty with my MP5. You just have to keep moving, and the prensense of ladders and jumpable allies between buildings makes that possible.</FONT><P>

It gave the level a refreshing feeling. It really does have the feeling of a city. The only reason I gave it a 7 is that I would like to see some more city addtions, like parked cars and a few stores you can duck into. Right now it's a very functional level, but if you have the oppurtunity to look around during the game... you'll notice it's very bear.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>Urban is back! This time in full daylight. The buildings remind me of the previous maps in
the Urban series, which is a nice thing since their desing is simplistic, but works
very well nonetheless. The layout is basically three main rooftops (with spawn points), the connecting
roofs, and the street beneath them. Only one thing hinders the layout, robbing it of a nice 8 or 9.
This is the fact that the rooftops are only reachable by two sets of ladders, and if a skilled and
controlled enough team spawns on top of the highest spawn point, it can easily control
the other team's upward access and pick them off one by one when they try to come up.</FONT><P>

had enough of them. _If_ Urban4 is being planned, please switch the textures.

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>Joy! I've found use for every weapon in the list on this map. Spray-toys are self-explanatory, and
everybody knows snipers are abundant on the rooftops of all urbans. What surprises me the most
is that even though this is a daylight map, stealth slippers and a M90 or a Hand Cannon can cause
a lot of damage. It seems that rooftop snipers tend to think that nobody can come behind them.
They do, however, learn after a few rounds of HC-aided flights...
All in all, excluding the occasional camper, this map is a delight.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 5/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>No sounds, no catchy details, no nothing. To me it seems that Urbans have always
relied on the Fun Factor to patch up what they lack in the extras department,
and it works. While playing the Urban series maps I have never missed any sounds
or lighting effects; the fun replaces them well enough.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>Change the sky, give us a third ladder leading up and remove the spawn point from the "box" on
the plateau and TA-DA(!), a perfect map. Oh, and a good ping helps a lot in this map...</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>Good work Gerbil!! A fine addition to the Urban series.

<p><b><u>REVIEW</u><br>

  Architecture & Layout score</b> 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  This is the third version of urban and it still feels and plays like a fresh 

  map. If you have played the previous versions, you will notice the same basic 

  street layout, resembling a 'U'. The placement of some building and objects, 

  such as ladders and fences which stay consistent through each 'new and improved' 

  version. For example, the wooden fence and the A framed roof at the end of the 

  street. There is much more roof access then before, so be ready to climb many 

  ladders and jump onto many ledges. The flow of the games does stay consistent, 

  like most maps of this kind it can be challenging to achieve that final kill. 

  For obvious reasons, this is a sniper paradise. Many high roofs and areas of 

  cover when drawing fire. The MP4 and machinegun are also choice weapons when 

  it comes to weapon selection. 

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> 6/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Don't those same old building textures get old? Why yes they do, especially 

  on this map. Your basic red brick and white/gray concrete make up 90% of the 

  buildings. The only exception, a non-accessible, white pane building, tallest 

  on the map. Gerbil!, we need some more variety in your textures for your upcoming 

  maps. The sky, when viewed from ground level is clean. Another rendition of 

  blue skies with white, wispy clouds. Yawn. There does seem to be a problem when 

  viewing buildings from across the entire map. The build become intermittent, 

  as pieces disappear. Possibly the map is too big? I don't know, I don't map. 

  I does seem to be only in a few areas, on a few buildings. 

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 9/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  I am not sure what it is about his maps, but I enjoy teamplay on the urban series. 

  As we know the city theme is old and reused, but it makes for good, solid game 

  of team Action. Another in which snipers thoroughly enjoy. The map is extremely 

  large and makes it difficult for a player to see the far reaches of the other 

  side, giving the advantage to the sniper. There is a spot where a team spawns 

  in a small room on the roof (pictured above). This has caused members to become 

  stuck and easy targets for the other team. Also if you do not get off this roof, 

  chances are you will be killed by a snipers bullet. Why? Because the other team 

  spawn on building directly across from this spot making it difficult to descend 

  off the roof if caught up there. Teamplay flows well on urban3 

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> 5/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Not much, since it is daytime. Although in the building pictured below, there 

  is nice shadow cast by the light shinning down through the hole in the roof. 

  But that is the extent of lighting effects. 

<p><b>Other:</b><br>

  What can you say? This is the third urban map in the series? The concept is 

  old, but the map plays well, I guess there is where it makes up for being so 

  unoriginal. Do these city maps ever get old? Yes they do, if they are done incorrectly 

  (blood). This map, in my opinion is done right to give you a "new" feeling to 

  an old theme. 

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  If you enjoyed playing the other two maps in the trilogy, then take the time 

  to download this one. There is nothing new he has added. You will get the same 

  feeling you had on the previous maps. Some of the buildings have been reworked, 

  as have the ladders. I guess I have something for city maps, I like playing 

  here, even though some of the scores do not reflect the playability of the map. 

  Take it or leave it, nothing special about the new urban3

  Architecture & Layout score</b> 4/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  I give the layout a four which is giving it more than it deserves. Far more. 

  I found the lack of mobility of this map insane, for someone to get to some 

  snipers is such a bitch i never bothered and just let them kill me. There were 

  so many pointless buildings and places that beautiful gunfights just don't seem 

  to matter in the surrealistic enviroment. I did like the row of windows (?) 

  probably the only nice touch to the layout. 

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> = 3/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The damn lighting makes me want to cry. No new textures as far as I see. The 

  lighting would be nice if he had some darker places to contrast instead of just 

  one or two buildings. Most of my problems came from washout of whoever i was 

  trying to kill. 

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 6/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  I like the ability to sneak up on some people on this map. My favorite frags 

  came from blasting some poor shmuck through a window he was sniping from. Groundside 

  the action is your usual bloodshed, with most of the frags relying on skill. 

  Didn't like the lack of cover. 

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> 3/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The whole map was an eyesore for me. I didn't catch a particular theme or mood 

  i could get, only that i wanted this match over so we can go to something better. 

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  I am a fan of the first urban maps like any good little AQ2 player is. But this 

  was a poor excuse for a urban map. i'd suggest redoing this map with better 

  lighting and taking your time building it.

<p><b><u>REVIEW</u><br>

  Architecture & Layout score</b> 4/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The problem i had with this map is i was playing it on a LAN with 2 friends 

  for the first time, and i found myself getting shot about 2 seconds after respawning, 

  not by my friends camping but because the map is so open, you can pop someone 

  from across the map. The buildings are boring, and if you start on a rooftop, 

  you generally have to plan your descent carefully to avoid cratering or ending 

  up crippled. 

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> 3/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Aiii that sky! For those of us who prefer the standard crosshair, you cant see 

  your sight against the sky if your aiming up at someone on a rooftop. I found 

  myself typing "sky drksky" within 2 minutes of starting the match. Also the 

  building in the center of the map looks as if someone dumped a huge bucket of 

  whitewash on it. 

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 7/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  This map was a generally fun play on the LAN, the hard part is if you spot someone 

  up on a rooftop, and they run back from the edge and you miss, chances are youre 

  not going to be able to climb up to the roofs very quickly to nab them. Also 

  the opposite is true, if you want to get down from a rooftop, its generally 

  "fall off and see if you splatter". The map also seems to be catered to the 

  rooftop lovers, because i rarely saw anyone running at ground level. 

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> 2/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Well, i gotta give credit, it does look like its daylight out, the lighting 

  on this map is so generally bright that theres no dramatic shadows. perhaps 

  Gerbil would be better off with a copy of arghrad using the _sun_light feature 

  it offers. The map would have looked much more realistic if some of the buildings 

  cast long shadows across the streets, ala Urban2. 

<p><b>Other:</b><br>

  Also, its pretty much un-avoidable in a large open map like a city level, but 

  the vis blocking on this map is horrible. Half the time as you rotate your view, 

  you see the building dissapear, revealing anyone hiding inside them. 

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  The map is a fairly good play, and its rather large for more populated games, 

  but the mood and ambience is lacking. Imagine how much better this map would 

  feel if you heard wind whistling by as you stoon on the edge of a building, 

  or if there were shadows to bandage in.

  I, personally, think that servers should play this map more often. Even me, 

  a HPB sniper, can snipe rather easily on this map. Also, for the experienced 

  cannoner can have a LOT of fun on this map >:) This map, however, cannot replace 

  the original, fun-filled, original Urban map. But it's a great get-away!

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  This is good in theory, that is, the idea of making the buildings varied and 

  having numerous access points to most of them, however it is a little confusing. 

  I think he got carried away, and departed too far from the simple elegance and 

  polished look of the original urban map.

  The textures are not so hot. Especially, I was dissapointed to see the return 

  of that white texture, the one on the building you can't go into in the middle. 

  This building looks like a big tiled monument or something. he would have done 

  better to steal a texture, than use this one. "Duke Nukem" had better building 

  textures than that! I gave it a couple of points for the nice sky though.

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Obviously, he bent to the desires of all the weak-ass sniper haters. Now I am 

  not a sniper, Action means action to me (i.e. moving around) but making it impossible 

  to snipe (as he has done here) is just not a good idea. For all the camper haters 

  out there: SNIPERS ARE GOOD. THEY KEEP YA ON YOUR TOES. IF YOU CANT'T TAKE THEM 

  OUT, YOU NEED TO PRACTICE MORE! I think one of the most intense experiences 

  I've ever had, is stalking a sniper with my assault shotgun... there is no safe 

  sniper spot in this level. This is a shame, that he gave in to all the weaklings 

  who cant stand it when they get killed for walking around in the open. 

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> 1/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The lights are a change, but they dont fly. In a level this open, the flat bright 

  lighting is boring, and removes what little cover is left in this maze of windows 

  and ladders. 

<p><b>Other:</b><br>

  R_SPEEDS!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAA!!!!! This is just plain poor design skills. I personally 

  have dual voodoo 2's but i hate when my friends have to leave the server, because 

  they can't handle the NUMEROUS areas where the R_SPEEDS are around 900, even 

  1000!! The original urban was much better in this respect. The average poly 

  count here has to be over 700!! This is what made me dislike this map the most. 

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  The original urban was better. It ran faster, was cleaner, simpler, had good 

  sniping spots, but had good spots to snipe on the snipers, and make banzai charges. 

  Urban 3: he must have forgot to check it in software mode. And he must have 

  had his brightness on his monitor all the way down, so he didnt realize how

I have been playing Action Quake for 3 months now, and I ONLY play urban maps. 

The other maps are good but they can't beat Urban1 and Urban2. I have been waiting 

for Urban3 for a while now, and its not as good as the other two. Their are many 

action zones (where all the action happens) and playing 4 on 4 teamplay isn't 

as fun. Its too big but the sniper spots a the best I've seen.

  One word: DULL. Its a normal city with a few buildings. Their are hardly any

<b><u>REVIEW</u><br>

Architecture & Layout score</b> = 6/10 <br>

<b>Commentary:</b><br> Firstly, I my self am a great fan of the

original Urban map.  Dont ask why, but I find that map hugely enjoyable.

It suffered a bit for a lack of routes but despite this drawback it was

attractive, reasonably fast (quite a feat considering I play on a p100) and

a good laugh.  Now we have urban3...  Layout wise, not a huge amount has

changed from 2.  The most noticeable change is the loss of the rooms in the

middle which have been replaced with rooms round the outside.  Hardly a

great step forward.

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> = 3/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br> At first glance it looks like little more than

a fullbright remix of the nicely lit urban2, but start looking a little

closer and it gets much worse.  Firstly, and quite importantly, it appears

that Gerbil! doesnt seem to realise that some ppl are still lumbered with

software mode, I literally ran around the map for 5 minutes in soft and had

to look away from the screen at the end of it.  Any mapper who remembers

the lurching feeling as they ran around there first little unlight/vised

creation will remember this gut feeling and fear it :)  Fortunately its not

so bad astheticly in GL but still it would be nice to see those weapon

flashes to get a hint as to who is mowing you down.  Texture wise its

pretty much the same set as 2.  Comon Gerbil!, urban1/2 both prove that you

can do better than this.

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> = 6/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br> Again this is another area in which I feel the

map is a step back,  Urban 2 balanced sniping by punishing ppl who hid in

the brightly lit buildings while providing shadows for those more willing

to dig deep into the fray, this aside the map is still quite an enjoyable

one with plenty of opportunities for quick headshots before someone gets a

bead on you.  Ammo wise the maps perhaps a little light for my tastes,  I

prefer resonable stocks of pistol ammo (which urban1 provides in abundance)

with much less ammo for the automatic weapons, in more open plan levels

this seems to be a VERY worthwhile trade off as it stops the lasersight/mp5

nutter from simply running round the map cleaning up freshly spawned

players.  

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> = 1/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br> Er ambience?  Sorry mate youve got the wrong

map here.  Seems Gerbil! forgot to include atmosphere this time round :/

<p><b>Other:</b><br> The above pretty much sums it up

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br> If anything after the classic Urban and good

urban2 maps, urban3 is a bit of a disapointment.  Many ppl have said this

before but ill say it again,  as far as im concerned this map is simply an

attempt to milk of the success of the other 2.  If your running out of

ideas Gerbil! then move on!

<b><u>REVIEW</u><br>Architecture & Layout score</b> = 8/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br> Much better layout than its parent maps. I

like that there are many ways to get from one end of the map to the other.

Great for sneaking up on a sniper and introducing him to your shotgun. =)

There is a lot of open area, so machinguns still have an edge, but less so

than urban2 for instance.

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> = 4/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br> I know i'm being a little harsh here but I

believe it's justified.  I think most people will agree that the map is too

bright. Stealth is difficult  because of it. In addition, the textures,

being the same ones from urban and urban2 are getting a bit on the old

side. It really looks like Urban with a different bright sky and the

buildings moved around.

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> = 8/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br> It is a good time though. There is a place for

all the weapons, even though the open areas give range weapons an edge,

there is plenty of places to take cover and to flank your enemies.

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> = 6/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br> It's a city... Not much to say about this. It

feels like urban. The map looks more cartoonish than other city maps due to

the lack of details around. (signs, things on the streets, etc.)

<p><b>Other:</b><br> There are a few areas where players can get stuck on

ladders, ledges etc. Some clip brushes would have been nice in a few areas,

but not enough to really draw from the map's quality.

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br> Overall I wasn't super impressed. The map is by

no means of poor quality, but it suffers from sequel syndrome (Really, was

Rocky III all that great?) =). It looks like Urban rehashed, but on the

plus side, The playability is much better than other city maps (with the

exception of city by Ruskprick)

<b><u>REVIEW</u><br>Architecture & Layout score</b> = 9/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br> The layout of the map couldn't be anymore

balanced. There are sniper nests, for snipers, and plenty of running/cover

room for assaulters. This map looks like it would be hard to camp in,

seeing how there is more then 1 enterance to anywhere in the map. CAMPERS

BEWARE! 

The buildings look great, ammo is perfectly placed as well. 

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> = 10/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br> I've never seen a map so beutiful. This map is

the supremecy of all maps. I loved urban, and urban two was great too, but

my god. I loaded up Urban3 and my jaw hit the floor. This level has it all

folks. Details are extravagant. There are ledges on buildings, great

lighting for teamplay, and an overall  10.



<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> = 10/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br> The fun of the level alone ranks it a 10 in my

book. I don't recommend it for deathmatch (unless there is more then 5

people in the game) only for the fact that it is HUGE.  But wow, what a

teamplay level this will make. It will force teams to ditch the old

Guerrilla warfare tactics, and draw a new gameplan, a strategic one. And

because this should prove to be a NO CAMPER zone, it will probably be the

best map so far.

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> = 10/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br> I'm at a loss for words... WOW. The

setting/mood of this level is just breathtaking. Even without a voodoo

card, this level looks great. The mood seems to be mid-day in the obvious

city setting. But its litterally as big as a city, bringing out more

snipers, but also making it fun for sniperkillers as well.

<p><b>Other:</b><br> Aside from the.. well.. I have no complaints on this

side. This is the best urban level yet to come.. KEEP 'EM COMING GERBIL!.

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br> Well, great job Gerbil!, I mean what a map.

My overall score is 10/10 and i just want to find a server that will play

urban1-3all the time. I hope you people appreciate this level as much as i

do. 

HOO YAH GERBIL!
