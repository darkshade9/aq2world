<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR> This map is very original, there are lots of bumps and alot of cover. There are plenty of places to hide behind. It is large so it can be easy to get lost until you get used to the map. The large underground lake in the middle is done very well, it's sort of the center of the map, if your trying to go from one side to the other you basically have to go through it. There is also a small outside forested area which is the first well done forest i've seen in a quake2 map so far.
The layout is very well done overall. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR> It looks spectacular, the lighting coming through the holes in the ceiling look very real. the textures are smooth and go well with the lighting. the waterfall is nice though it could be better. the best part of this map is the forest area though. wow. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR> very fun. I can see how alot of people would get bored playing this map, even 1on1 games are quite long, but people who think this map is boring just aren't intelligent players, these people have probably never heard of strategy. unlike other maps you can't just go running out into the open guns blaring and expect to get some kills like you could on teamjungle or cliff2. This takes intelligence and if your looking for a good map to sneak around on and use some hit and run tactics then this is your map. I don't play dm anymore, too easy. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR> The sounds, lighting, looks and overall feeling of the map really seem to put you in the game, i've had several people say wow, you really scared me, after I'm been done killing them. You get more into the game than you do on other maps. It can either be a very dark map, if you put your gl_modulate down, although I know most of you won't.
the slightest movement or sound can make you flinch and turn to see if your enemies are right behind you. It's great. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR> This map is a fun if you like slower non-rushing games and is worth downloading. I'd definatly put this map into my regular rotation if I had a dedicated server. Good job gimp, can't wait for you next map. </FONT><P>

This is a interlinked series of tunnels (very ncie looking) that you may find in a tropical dormant Valcano. Some water and such... very nice, tight and lots of cover. </FONT><P>

Ok, i nearly weren't blistic when i first saw it... i didn't think ppl could get the q2 engine to do such nice work, after such fatal maps as deepcanyon (right angles) and alot of boxy shapes and such in the maps. This truely does look (well as close as you can get in the q2 engine) to a tropic island volcano! congrads. I wish more mappers would put this detail into their maps...

unfortunatly this is where the map sufers. It is really large, (like i am thinking Blockwar size maybe) you can get lost in it easily (infact i did a few times) and teamplay is slow when it comes down to the last 2 ppl, and if so lamer is in their camping away (although i couldn't think of a nice place to camp =) ) it could take 5 or 6 minutes easy to find him... I don't do DM but i would guess you would need about 10 or more ppl to have a good game. </FONT><P>

Excellant! the bird and the other sounds (maybe some monkeys i think) really add the tropic feel to it.... the envirionment is excellant... that nice little waterfall too... looks liek something from Hawaii. maybe a pineapple tree or soemthuing but even the trees look nice here. those sounds make the difference ppl, so put a few in your next map. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Other Comments:</B><BR> I am running this on a PII 400 so i don't have a problem running anything... but for those of you with slower end machines, my frined was complaining about some slow points when he palyed it byhimslef on his comp (it is under a 200) so... but for a decent box, it seems to be fine for me... </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>
If you going to run it on your server, put a roundtimelimit of like 4 or 5 on it, and don't spend anymore than a ï¿½ hour on it (waiting kills a game, jsut as fast as a camper does) but for a quick stunt, it is fun... i would dl it just for the fact that is it looks nice. </FONT><P>

This map is probably the most incredible I have seen thus far for AQ2. What won it for me, is it's incredible design. Things just seemed to make sense. I don't know... it just was, like, in place. Most maps seem awkward at times, almost pulling off their objective, but not seeming right, this map is very right. </FONT><P>

Where should I start? Moss hanging from ledges, lighting that actually looks real, trees that ACTUALLY look like trees... And I can go on and on. This map looks more like an Island on RIVEN then a map that you frag people on... it almost seems sacreligious to do so, in a place so incredible. This map even looks good on my crappy ass resolution, so I give it two BIG thumbs up. </FONT><P>

Dripping cave walls, excotic bird calls... the ambiance is like I said, RIVEN like. Some maps are just plain ugly, with oddly sized things, and uncorrectly named, like Jungle for instance, which looks more like a park with very well cropped trees. This map is so right in so many ways, like I have said. DOWNLOAD THIS MAP!!! </FONT><P>

I don't know about the gameplay, but I had a lot of fun just walking through it. Give it a try. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>
This map, is already my favorite map, and I haven't even played it in a deathmatch/team play. But if I did, I'd probably love it. Unlike other people, I love HUNTING down my victims, where it takes a long time to sneak around with my MP5, until you finnally get the confrontation, that's a good level. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR> All in all this is the best non-urban map out there. Not so good for teamplay, but deathmatch with about 6 people is just perfect. I hope the maker of this map makes a sequel. </FONT><P>

Definately not your typical map. No buildings whatsoever. Strictly an outdoor map with many nooms and crannies to hide in. Also some high ground to climb up on and water to hide in. The map is rather large though and will take many hours of play to learn the layout. I have to give the layout high marks just for the originality. </FONT><P>

Looks great ... the maps name suits it perfectly. Between swimming in the water that i assume are underground springs ... and running thru the tunnels this map is a constant surprise to the eyes. Really a surprise ... I have never seen a map even similar to this and you haven't either. </FONT><P>

TOO BIG!!! Unless you have a minimum of 5 man teams this map is useless in teamplay. Likewise it is to big for CTB ... I haven't played it in DM though and i think it might be ok there with a large number of players at least 8 to 10. weapons aren't always easy to find but that is just because it is so big. Although stuuning to look at and very original this map is a let down in the gameplay department. Even with a multitude of players i think the size will still be an obstacle to quick play. Be sure to set a time limit of you want to use this on a server. </FONT><P>

The ambiance is great. You get the feeling you are in a strange and exotic landscape and the change in the lighting from bright sunlight out in the open to dark shadow in the tunnels and the water is excellent. Runnign thruogh the tunnels not knowing if you are going to round a corner and run right into someone was a great feeling ... provided lots of excitement ... if only the map was small enough that you ran into people more often than every 2 minutes. I don't know about you but i find having to search for several minutes to findpeople to kill boring. </FONT><P>

Definately a new twist. Worth looking at i just wish it was smaller. It is a very new map and I am anxious to hear other opinios about it so download it, play it and write your own review! </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>
I would put this map on my server on a regualr basis if only it wasn't so big. I think that if it was half the size it would be perfect. I think after playing this map extensively to learn all the nooks and crannies it might be a blast to play. However taking the time to learn it just may be a bit too tedious. The originality of the map earns it an avergae score though. </FONT><P>

This map looks SO realistic. First when I started to play Lavatube, I ended up dancing and hopping in the dark tube and I thought myself: "isn't this too simple map, running in some kind of tube". Then I got lost. Now that was fun. I didn't have any idea where I was going. The ground, the cave ceiling, the waterfall... everything fits so well to Lavatube.

How it looks ? It looks outstanding. Yup, very good textures and the water is also different here. Fits very well to this cave atmosphere. Not only you can frag on the cave, you can also climb or find your way to outside. Trees are looking very good and the background scene is also impressive.

I think, DM is really fun in Lavatube. Not only fun, but exciting. Teamplay could also be fun, but if I had to choose I'd take DM. I can't wait till I see this map in some of the AQ2 servers.

Sound-work finishes the experience creating really believable atmosphere. You know, those cave-like water-sounds and the sounds outside are taken straight from some kind of jungle. Very nice !

So, I got lost. Now that's something that you could dream about in 3D-action games. Imagine this, you are playing DM and you notice that you have no ammo to your pistols. "Now, where was that MP5". No time to think 20 blood-hungry-players are hunting you.
</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>
Really nice map ! Bigger than average and much better than average. 9 or 10...10 because this very good map for a long time. Wait, till I get to Deathmatch Lavatube.
