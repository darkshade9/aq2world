   <b>Review:</b><br>
  I was a fan of the original Midtown, and Midtown X is the new version found   on the extremeties pack. But it's not a simple texture uplift, the map has been   overhauled (somewhat.) Added to the level is a whole new harbour section, increasing   the size of the level and adding a few new tricks and traps to the level. I   guess there's not much more to say about this map. The new textures look a little   gay (especially the sky) but all in all a good level. <br>

<font size="2">Ok, first off, if you liked Midtown, you'll probably like this one. MidtownX is basically Midtown in the daylight, with Duke-Nukem looking buildings, and with some changes, including a dock with green water. Item placement for DM was ok, but was a little light for my tastes. There were a lot of little places to go and hide, and a few interesting Corridors of death. The buildings look a bit clutered, but some are good. It should be a good DM map, and possibly a good Teamplay map. <br>

Well, after 10 minutes of teamplay, it was obvious. This is one map to avoid.   Besides being ugly, its just too big. While this map may have a few nice features   (the docks with the ship and the seagull sounds) they cant save it. On a teamplay   server with 8 players the rounds were taking forever, just too many places to   go and too many nooks and crannies to get lost in. Perhaps a DM round with a   LOT of people would work here...if you don't mind looking at the textures. But   for teamplay, forget about it. There are quite a few problem areas in the map,   with the library being the worst. I mean, during the 10 minutes I was there   I heard 3 different people comment on getting lost navigating through it. There   are just too many good maps out there right now to spend any time on Midtown   X. <br>

  </font><font face="arial" size="2">First let me say that I am aware of the work   that goes into making these maps and I commend everyone who does so for the   benefit of our gaming community. Because of that, I want it known that even   if my evaluation of a map is not complimentary, it is not a reflection on the   author and I encourage him/her to continue creating maps. Having said that,   I offer my opinion on the above referenced map. I wandered around for a few   minutes and then deleted it from hard drive. I will not play it, even for the   15 minutes until the next rotation. This is ONLY because I cannot stand a map   that entirely made up of that god-awful black and red checkered pattern. I think   this pattern is ugly and only detracts from a map. My suggestion is take the   exisiting map, and re-texture it with a real-world environment. Then I'll try   it out again. <br>
