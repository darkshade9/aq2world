<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR> ok, this is a sniper friendly map... but from what i have experienced, it is not a camper friendly map. only the sniper rifel can make those huge shots to plug someones head from their body all the way across the map. Great... a few ways around to everywhere... i like it.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR> ok, this one shocked me... the actual hight of the damn thing. it is so awesome. my friend and i were palying, and i was afk for a second. he poped me in the head 4 times with the m4 befor i died. that shows how far it is... this make for eom interresting battles with the sniper rifle. also, you m4 nuts can leap over the edge, hit the water, and go bonkers with it in the bottom, while the snipers are [plugging your budds up top </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR> good. sometimes a long drawn out sniper war, with someone slipping at the very end is funny. m,ostly rather quik matches. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR> i felt like i was bond in goldeneye, jumping from the damn in the beginning of the movie. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Other Comments:</B><BR> nice. i would add it to my map rotation. put a timelimit on the rounds, just incase there is some lame camping in there. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR> very fun... learn to snipe, and you can be a machine in here. go bust some nerds! </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR> This map is really attractive off the bat. It looks like the dam in Goldeneye. Its architecture is fantastic and has lots of treats. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR> The giant dam is overwhelming. I've never seen anything quite like this in a AQ map. Textures on the damn are great. The canyon walls all over are great. Everything else looks good!! </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR> This is a very different Team experience. It is a BIG map. You'll probably need a fast comp to run it well (i have a PII -hehe). Team games start far off from each other and offer many ways to engage each other. There are plenty of sniping positions. Jumping off the dam is the best part! You'll hear a nice scream too! If u go down too deep in the water you'll here: "It was a bad idea comin' down this far." DM on this is half decent - hard to find weapons but very interestin! </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR> Feels like a warm summer day.... uhh... what am I supposed to say? It's depressing? Anyways, it makes me feel good inside... there. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Other Comments:</B><BR> If u have a fast machine, play it as much as u can! If not... uh... play cracked instead. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR> Great map BBQ! Cool sounds, original idea and great architecture! Looks great, runs great and feels great! :) </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR> I don't think I have EVER seen a map that could ever compare to the style of this map. When I first ran the map I started at the bottom, but as soon as I looked up, I knew that this map was going to be GREAT. The effect of a tall, curved wall for the dam really made this map realsitic. I can't believe how well this map was put together. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR> This map looks great! Everything, textures, water, sky, colors, are all pleasing to the eye. I love the texture he used for the dam wall, and the texture for the water. The lighting does a lot for the level, especially under water, and at the bottom of the dam. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR> I recently went to a LAN party where we played Actdam for a long time. With only 5 people, this map kept us interested for a long time. When we decided to fool around on it, the map was perfect for kickboxing on the big beam across the gorge. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR> All I can say is, good lighting effects, but mostly, great sound! I was real surprised when I fell off the dam and that screaming noise came. The sounds under water with the gears and generators really sounded in place. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Other Comments:</B><BR> I'm not sure I like the little rooms under the towers...someone could just hide down there with no one knowing.. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR> This map is great for deathmatch mainly, I don't think it would work real good with teamplay. Other than that, this map really hit a good note with me, because it had very unusual elements that many maps dont have. </FONT><P>
