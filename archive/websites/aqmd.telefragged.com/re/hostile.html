<b>Review:</b><br>

Hostile Takeover is a fairly large map, with this said, it's not so good for small games of deathmatch or even small teamplay games, even though the level flows very well, it's pretty easy to get lost, i recommend playing this map on a server with at least 8 people, it's still fun with less, but you're going to have much less encounters with enemies. The Architecture in this map was GREAT, the chairs, desks, computers, and other fixtures look better than in any map i have ever seen before. Lighing, this map has pretty good, alot of action quake2 maps I've been seeing laterly have very poor lighting, either too dark or way too light in areas.. suffice to say this map isn't like that. Weapon/Ammo placement was great, ammo was scarse, not spammed around all over the place like in most maps, i'm not too sure about every weapon, because the level is quite big and i dont think i've been through every weapon, but they are well placed in that sense. The gameplay of this map is probably the most strategical of all action maps which encourages stealth, and use of the silencer to keep concealed from enemy sight/ears.. now.. the framerate for this map was absolutely great for the size of it, it ran fine, i had framerate problems in maybe 1 or 2 places, and that was only when i stood in a certain spot  (and my computer sucks :P). The setting of this map is a school. it's probably not so convincing that it is a school at first look, but after looking through alot of the rooms, you catch on to the theme.<p>

my only rants about this map is that it's a seemingly huge map and not for small games... and those elevators in the main hall crush people if they stand in the doorway. overall, if i were giving this map a rating out of 10, i would definitly give it  a10, this isn't any ordinary map.
