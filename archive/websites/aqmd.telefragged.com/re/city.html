      Architecture & Layout score</b> 10/10 <br>

      <b>Commentary:</b><br>

      This maps layout is absoluteley fabulous! with multiple pathways to nearly 

      everywhere, drainpipes to climb. (there are usually several on each building 

      so it is easy to sneak up on someone if they dont watch their back) This 

      map isn't the biggest map but it is very hard to find yur way around at 

      first, but you get to know it. The only thing stopping me from giving this 

      map eleven is that the dial only goes up to ten. </font></font></p>

    <p><b>How It Looks score</b> 9/10 <br>

      <b>Commentary:</b><br>

      Although there isn't a lot of coloured light in this map which I really 

      love this map look excellent, but there are still some extremely well placed 

      bits of blue which look o so sexy, with lots of new textures, the billboards 

      on the buildings look really kickass in GL, but they are a bit blurry in 

      software mode. The small details like street signs and police stations and 

      a pizza resturant are extremely well done. 

    <p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 10/10 <br>

      <b>Commentary:</b><br>

      With the excellent layout this map is fun, ive only played teamplay, but 

      DM should be very good. This map Rocks in teamplay! as ive said with the 

      drainpipes to climb and so on it is soooooo fun to play. 

    <p><b>Ambiance score</b> 8/10 <br>

      <b>Commentary:</b><br>

      The ambience is very good with the little flat with a stereo and tv, the 

      stereo is playing a tune which you will actualy want to listen to, unlike 

      the shocking one in police. 

    <p><b>Other:</b><br>

      DOWNLOAD THIS MAP NOW, EVEN IF YOUR SERVER DOESN'T RUN IT! 

    <p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

      This is easily the best, most fun map i have ever had the pleasure of playing. 

    <p><b>Overall score:</b> 10/10

      </font></font>Rusprick did it again. After the astounding teacher i was 

      really waiting for the next by the author, and oh my GOD. This map is already 

      seems to be a legend amongst the community, tho some of the credit goes 

      to Karlsson and the halirrious radio. The spectators just love it when you 

      camp in the room and Swing It.<br>

      The textures are clear, enchanting. The map runs amazingly well, i bet thanks 

      to the minimal use of surfaces. For example the ladders are made just as 

      they should be, while simulating a "round" surface would make your processor 

      steam, as seen on other maps like Urban.<br>

      The overall structure is very good, allowing the player to use many different 

      styles and approaches. Basically the streets, with any number of roofs to 

      deliver death from above. The balconies, stairs, rooms one can go into, 

      and crates on the street are incredibly well placed. Not too complex, logical, 

      and exciting. No choke points to kill teamplay, but you will not get lost 

      either. The streets look realistic, the scale is great, and the whole thing 

      reminds me of a Swedish suburb.<br>

      Run this map if you run a server, this is the teamplay blast of the Xmas.<br>
