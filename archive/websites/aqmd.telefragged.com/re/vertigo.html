<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR> This map is definitly unique. The architecture is very unconventional. It might have been a fun style of map, but the way the different places of the map connect to one another make it irritating to move around from place to place. Teamplay does not play well. (map is too big) Perhaps action deathmatch might be more fun, but who really plays that. </FONT><P>

A bit above the average when it comes to texture choices, and texture alignments.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR> There are some fun things about the map. Would be most fun in deathmatch.
I laughed outloud when I saw the sign "You had better run!" in the disco bar.</FONT><P>

Irritation.. "How to I get over there?" you are constantly thinking.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>I was a big fan of highrise however this map just didn't seem to do it for me. It feels a bit like Actcity3 only in this map, if you jump of the building while it is saying, &quot;Lights&quot; you will still hit the ground way after &quot;Action&quot;. Due to the map's pure size it would surely become a huge sniper war with every one on 6x zoom. Sure you can get inside the buildings but in teamplay you rarely start close enough to actually get a shot off with that M4 or Shotgun.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>It looks kinda struffy.... KaRRiLLioN was never known for the beauty of his maps..... or at least not by me and this map although quite detailed has that &quot;budget&quot; look about it. One part of the map that does look good is when you look over the edge of the buildings.... Now on video card couldn't render that far so as i got closer to the ground the road beneath me started to appear and the &quot;SPLAT&quot;. I would download the map just to do this a few time :)</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>Well after all the bad stuff I have said the map sure is fun. I find myself trying to snipe them out for a while and then one of us will fall off the building. There is also a cool little disco at the top of one of the buildings and it has a little &quot;booby trap&quot; when you try to get the M4. I just don't understand how KaRRiLLioN made this map.... it is just so massive.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 10/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>Just jump of the side of the building a few times.... you will understand.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>Well KaRRiLLioN mave have not maded another 10/10 but he sure has done something that I didn't think was possible.... This map is just massive. This is the only map where I have been scared to run across a powerline between two buildings.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>If you like heights you should like the map..... If you are scared of hieghts you will love it :) </FONT><P>
