        Architecture & Layout score</b> 6/10 <br>

        <b>Commentary:</b><br>

        Well, this map wasn't too spread out and it wasn't too complicated a design. 

        The many ledges give you the ability to snipe, yet the hand cannon is 

        also pretty good because of the several roof tops and building floors. 

        Cunning little secret passages make it possible to get from one place 

        to another very quickly. Oh, and the garbage catapult is pretty fun. 

        <p><b>How It Looks score</b> 3/10 <br>

          <b>Commentary:</b><br>

          UGLY. UGLY. UGLY. This map needs a major make-over. However, the author 

          was kind enough not to go for a super-dark night setting in which there 

          would be tons of dark corners and it would just be masking some of the 

          texture problems. The ?disco? room is meant to give people epileptic 

          siezures (I know I can't spell). The elevator is ugly also and needs 

          some work. 

        <p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 7/10 <br>

          <b>Commentary:</b><br>

          I'm persuming that like most other systems, 5 is an average map worth 

          downloading, anything higher is special, anything lower isn't too good. 

          So, well I thought this level was really fun for DM (haven't tried it 

          in TP). Because of the simple layout, there are never any hard to find 

          campers. I've only tried it with at most 4 people but it was fun. Pretty 

          cool for small LAN games. 

        <p><b>Ambiance score</b> 3/10 <br>

          <b>Commentary:</b><br>

          Once again, not too good. The buildings are perhaps condemed? Or are 

          they just under construction and nothing much has been done? The pool 

          is a little strange (especially where it leads, are we swimming in raw 

          sewage?). 

        <p><b>Other:</b><br>

          The only obvios things I can think of to add are my small complaints, 

          elevator is no good. I a body ends up in the shaft everyone riding the 

          elevator is smushed when they hit the body. My other main complaint 

          is that when playing in software mode, the garbage catapult dissapears 

          when stared at from the right angle. As a non-complaint,, I found that 

          an interesting way to play this level is with a gravity of about 100. 

        <p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

          Well, here is a short way to describe this level: It is ugly but fun 

          for DeathMatch. It has a pretty good layout that enables the player 

          to get to each part of the level easily. Last, but not least, it has 

          interesting little things like a garbage catapult and diving boards. 

          It is worth downloading even if you just play with the toys. I'm giving 

          it a 6 because while it needs work, the design is quite smart and it 

          is just a little above average.

        Architecture & Layout score</b> 4/10 <br>

        <b>Commentary:</b><br>

        It's different. I've yet to see a map done quite as vertical as this one.It 

        has some interesting looking buildings. Doing a map like this has a lot 

        of potential. 

        <p><b>How It Looks score</b> 1/10 <br>

          <b>Commentary:</b><br>

          One of the ugliest maps I've ever seen. The textures are bland and one 

          dimensional, the lighting is flat and distributed, the buildings have 

          unheard of shapes. (I for one have never seen a building that gets wider 

          at the top. (With a pool on top of it.) 

        <p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 1/10 <br>

          <b>Commentary:</b><br>

          It was always hard to find an enemy in this map, and When you did find 

          someone, they could jump in one of those ridiculous air tunnels that 

          KaRRiLLioN seems so fond of. There is limited use for anything but a 

          sniper rifle or a machingun on this map. 

        <p><b>Ambiance score</b> 2/10 <br>

          <b>Commentary:</b><br>

          There are a bunch of conflicting moods to this map, and The air tunnels 

          pretty much destroy the entire thing. If the air tunnels pushed by fans 

          aren't bad enough, the invisible ones that throw a player into the pool, 

          or onto a roof are about as ridiculous as it gets. The scaling of the 

          map is inconsistant too. There are areas that make you seem like a giant 

          (doorways, elevators) and other areas that make you feel like you're 

          in the land of giants. (ladders to the diving boards at the pool.) 

        <p><b>Other:</b><br>

          This review is a little harsh, but after reading the good things some 

          people had to say, I think I need to discourage KaRRiLLioN from making 

          maps like this in the future. 

        <p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

          It's not that there wasn't effort put into this map. It has some good 

          ideas. Unfortuanately they are implemented poorly, in a cheesy fashion. 

          I make a note to leave any server if this 'map' comes up in the rotation.

        Architecture & Layout score</b> 7/10 <br>

        <b>Commentary:</b><br>

        The buildings are extremely tall, which should be expected from a map 

        called Highrise. However, they're not exactly works of art. Travel between 

        buildings is made interesting by the use of fans that shoot players up 

        to the tops of the buildings. One of them will smash the player into the 

        bottom of an elevator, which is really fun. Unfortunately, none of the 

        fans that I know of will send a player to the top of the building with 

        the catapult, so it's more difficult to reach. Players have to use a dangerous 

        elevator that can smash them or climb up the outside. I'd have given more 

        points here if that were not the case. 

        <p><b>How It Looks score</b> 4/10 <br>

          <b>Commentary:</b><br>

          The buildings are just plain ugly. I know how difficult it is to use 

          textures (mine suck), but that yellow brick texture looks awful. Also, 

          the tiles in the pool don't fit in with the rest of the map, although 

          they do make it hard to see other players in there. The water texture 

          doesn't line up and it's not transparent, although that may have been 

          on purpose. 

        <p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 9/10 <br>

          <b>Commentary:</b><br>

          Flying through the air is a great feeling, especially when you manage 

          to get that sniper off the roof of the tallest building with a flying 

          knife as you shoot past on your way to the pool. (It's possible; I've 

          done it.) Plus, the incredible distance to the ground makes falling 

          to your death a new experience. The only thing that detracts from the 

          fun is getting smushed by the catapult or the working elevator, but 

          that can be avoided. 

        <p><b>Ambiance score</b> 5/10 <br>

          <b>Commentary:</b><br>

          There isn't really a mood to this map. It accomplishes the feel of very 

          high buildings, but that's about as far as the mood goes. This map is 

          meant to be fun, not moody or artistic. 

        <p><b>Other:</b><br>

          The only other thing worth mentioning is that sometimes one of the sniper 

          rifles or M4s disappears. They simply never respawn. I have no idea 

          what causes this, but I've seen this happen in other maps, too, and 

          not just when there are two of one weapon. 

        <p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

          It is clear that this map was made to be fun, not pretty, and it is 

          definitely very fun. I've never taught so many people how to fly on 

          one map before. If you like kicking snipers off buildings, or performing 

          death-defying acrobatic feats, then this is the map for you.

        <b>Commentary:</b><br>

        Ugh, absolutely hideous! The author of this map obviously did NOT go for 

        layout or architectural wonderment. The focus of the level was a use of 

        triggered effects and other special perks that, if the level was well 

        designed, would've made an A-rated map! Instead it leaves one with a shitty 

        sense of "God, I can't hit a damn thing!" Grenades, handcannons, sniper 

        rifles, and anything except for a random spray of MP5 or M4 rounds are 

        useless in this level. Ugh, overall, ugly! I give it a five because some 

        of the special effects are pretty nifty.

        every little detail is perfect in a wonderful layout of 3 buildings spaned 

        equally apart & a small house sized bulding at the base of the biggest.

  Well...its kinda high...and kinda spaceous...and big...and a bit laggy (especially 

  in my WAY under par GL) However, I like it. The few rooms int eh buildings are 

  sufficiently detailed while the streets (is that a road all the way down there?) 

  are more bland so as not to create massive r_speeds. The rooftops are a bit 

  crap, the Garbage crane is likely to amuse people as will the elevator fans. 

  A pretty original idea and a bit like actcity3 </p>

  Well like i said; a bit bland and annoying. Ruskprick's yellow brick texture 

  is not properly remipped with wally so I have to do that myself (Chris P did

  are quite disapointing.
