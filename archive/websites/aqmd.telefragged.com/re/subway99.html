<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Rating:</B> 9/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>I would rate the architecture a 9 for one reason and one reason only: The train is difficult to controll. There should be more switches to start and stop the train. Other than that the architecture is perfect. The outdoor city area is a very nice touch, and the flooded bathroom is cool.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>Once again T.T.I hands us a beautifully done map with all origional textures, great ambience, and the his usual attention to detail. What he did with this map, is like a combo between subway2 and urban. You have the large city area, riddled with sniper spots naturally, and then you have the underground subway area, complete with waterfalls, electrified tracks, and for once, the train actually moves! I love how this map looks hence the rating.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Rating:</B> 7/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>This I rated a little lower than the others. The reason is that picture this: you spawn on the top of the building. Your lookin around for five minutes thinkin your hot stuff. Then you realize, that you have no clue where the other guy is. The map is so huge, that you can spend the entire time just looking for somebody, much less trying to kill them.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 9/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>This was also pretty good. You can deffinitely tell where you are, but you almost never know where your enemy is. This is nice because it adds an added degree of suspense, and then all of the sudden, BAM!!! you get smacked with a handcannon. This makes not only teamplay, but death match not only a great challenge, but a lot of fun</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Other Comments:</B><BR></FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>Overall I think this was an excellent map. T.T.I clearly has some mad mapping skills as he has demonstrated in the past. This map, next to actcity3 and urban, has got to be my favorite map of all. So why are you even bothering to read this conclusion? Go get the fricken map!!!</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Rating:</B> 8/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>The basic layout is very well done and there are no real camping spots. My only problem was with the tall buildings, they should have some bridges or walkways connecting them to make sniper hunting a bit easier. Other than that i thought that this map was very well designed and can be enjoyed by a handcannoner or a sniper alike.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Rating:</B> 9/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>In my opinion, this is one of the nicest looking action maps. The design is simple with nice looking textures and posters on the wall. Also the little features are cool, like the flooding toilet, or the small street signs. Unlike the earlier subway maps, this map actually looks like an actual subway.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Rating:</B> 9/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>This map is extremely well balanced and is well suited for any weapon. You can ambush automonkeys at the stairs with shotguns, snipe people from the roof, spray&amp;pray on the street, knife people on the dark corridors and the handgrenades aren't too deadly on this map.<br>Also the fact that games are usually short because of the good layout, makes this map very fun to play. The only major fault in this map is that most of the fighting happens on the rooftops instead of the subway.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 10/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>The ambiance is absolutely perfect. It actually feels like an subway, with the flooding toilet and a small outdoor area. The corridors are suitably eerie and the ads on the walls look nice.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>The outside area feels rather empty. It doesn't affect the gameplay but it could have been nicer if the author added some cars or something to the streets.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>This map became current AQ2 favorite map after i played some games on this. It looks great, plays even better and even I can get some frags on this map. </FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Architecture Rating:</B> 7/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>Ok the layout is just wicked. The subway runs under an urban like level with a similar feel to urban2. Allowing for close in combat in the subway and sniping on the roof tops. What makes these roof tops different is you can jump from one to the other very safely; meaning that you can jump on to the roof top of a unsuspecing sniper and point blank him with a hand cannon. What would have made this map truly the best would have been if you could get inside the buildings and come up into them through the subway ect.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Looks Rating:</B> 6/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>The textures are a little bit budget but it feels good aswell as different. The backdrop on the level is also a cool change. It is perhaps not as detailed as the other subways but this improves the lag and r_speeds.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Gameplay Rating:</B> 7/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>It has a new feel to it and breaths life back into the city style map the only thing holding it back is the fact that you can't get inside the sky scrapers. The ladders are well designed so that you got fall off all the time makeing this map pure skill.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 5/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>This area of the map is where it is let down. No Sounds ect. The subway design helps with a cool bathroom (the best ever) and a small shop but you just never go down there.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>Subway??
The game is played in the city on this map and in teamplay I found my self on the roof tops for 90% of the game. In the next subway map the players should be forced into the subway as it does make a cool battle field.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>The map is good fun and with an update or two (allowing players into the buildings) would make this map a real winner.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>
I enjoyed playing above ground. It is fun to sit up on a 20 story building and shoot people on the street.
The bad thing about this map is that it is just over the line for being too large for teamplay.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Looks Rating:</B> 9/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>Nice job on the textures and alignments. </FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Gameplay Rating:</B> 7/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>Like I said before, the map is too big for 2 minute rounds in teamplay. The subway electric thing where you can turn off and on the rails is pretty neat. Though I rarely found myself down in that area. Only on the occation I was trying to find the last bad guy.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR> Everything is there except for that subway smell. :)</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Other Comments:</B><BR></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Conclusion:</B><BR> Not a good teamplay map. Too large.
Would be a good deathmatch map in that there are a lot of fun things to do.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>Did not find anything wrong here. I liked the building textures and the subway textures. They all fit pretty well. Also I did not find any seams.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>I thought it looked pretty good. It really makes you feel like you are in subway or out on the New York streets. And the Subway car was a great idea. I liked how it moved and you could shut it off!!</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Gameplay Rating:</B> 10/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>This map was great!! I only played with two people but we could always find eachother. Even when one of us "Camped" (The other guy).
Once we played this level we did not stop playing it....It was just damn fun!!! You have your sniping yet your small corridoors too!!!!
And if someone camps in the Subway just hand them a grenade!!!! LOL</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 9/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>Definately a great feel ya get the street sounds when you are outside and the look of the subway gave you that subway feeling!! It was a fun mood. and if ya did get down a bit just head over to the Java Cafe'. Or relax by the cool Waterfall/Fountain..(Waterfalls rock) ;-)
The only sound I did not like was the Sirens it was ok but a little loud. And allso at first the street noises are wierd but once you get into playing the sounds just implement themselves and you feel like you are out in the streets. Great Job</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>I feel TP would be Great!! Up to 8-10 players. But Dm I think 10 would be bit much. All in All this is a great map and I think Subwaylate99.bsp would be great too :-)<hint hint></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>This is a great map for as low as 2 people to as high as 10. Your snipers are happy and so are your Groundmen. Its just plain Damn fun!!!</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Architecture Rating:</B> 8/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>Quite balanced and well made. The outdoors are excellent for sniping and the subway's narrow corridors are excellent for those fraggers who like to spray ppl with their MP5 or pound them with shotgun rounds. Well made, good job TTI!</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>New texture is bright and looks cool. Good sniping spots and textures are similar to other familiar maps. No complaints here.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Gameplay Rating:</B> 9/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>I loved this map on teamplay, i often switched weapons and had no problems with any of them, depending whether you're offensive or defensive. I had a blast on this map!</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 8/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>This map is pretty bright and "cheerful" you could say. Very fast paced downstairs in the subway and slow when sniping on top of the buildings. Gets you pumped up to shower some ppl!</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>The car honks and other sound effects are well done (although i did iss that red car with the cool music) :)
Silencers and laser sights are not recommended while sniping, but kevlar vests are the best. You should go with the stealth slippers and either the knives or handcannon when going offense in the subway downstaris, VERRRY SNEAKY!!!!</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>An overall good maps with few downfalls, but overall quite enjoyable no matter which weapon you use!</FONT><P>
