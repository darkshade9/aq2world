<b>Review:</b><br>



After the first edition of Mall came out, I treated it as a regular map. It had some great sniping shots, but I real;y prefered the Office more. Well, after I saw the revised version, WOW! Adding the M4 is much more fun, and location for weapons is better. (Putting both machine-guns next to each other!) The roof and and back rooms really add more to the overall gameplay, and by taking out the sniper areas it made it much more an open fight.

My favorite map from the first five I played with AQ2 (v.93), Mall2 has grown! The roof and back rooms add so much to an already awesome level. My former college roommate and I play AQ2 2 player all the time, and while the original map was the perfect size for a 2-man game (plenty of time spent stalking and hiding and ducking into the BBQ to snatch the H&K - not to mention hiding white-knuckled in the crapper with nothing more than a pistol and 2 bullets while the other one sat outside aiming at the door), the additions are good and add to the experience for a larger group. The tri-level layout with corners to hide (and get stuck) in, makes for a great playing experience. While I do always laugh at the fact that opponents look like kids running around (as everything was designed taller than the players), I appreciate the fact that the building has enough room to move around. Some levels lately have been so cramped that ducking, dodging and running is not an option. The flow of this level is excellent, and the only way you can get cornered is behind a door, not in a hallway.<br>
