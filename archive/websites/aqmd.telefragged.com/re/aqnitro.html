<b>Review:</b><br>





Overall:

This map is not small, not large. It basically are 4 buildings (3 little and 1 larger), a litlle open maze, a catwalk, and a "garden" with some hills. It is set up with some space, and it is clearly daylight. The author worked from a filosophy that it had to be a map where you could run around and where the emphasis was not on close combat. I think he has accomplished most of that in this map.

 <p>

Outdoors:

What I really liked were the facts that you could acces most of the roofs of the buildings but they are all a little different: views and a few possibilities to hide. It is great to get up there and try to take some runners out. You still have to guard your ass though, for you cannot cover it up, so snipers beware! In this way balance is being kept, despite the fairly long distances snipers are not quite in advance. Another plus is that you can run through all the buildings: there's more than 1 way in. So you can run around. And there are plenty of playstyles to be practised here except for close combat: there's this really neat open maze with a catwalk above it and a building on the other side. So keep a grenade in store for when you're up there and your victim goes in the maze! And your gun could do the rest, just in case ;-) But there's more about this in the Weapons part.

  <p>

Then the downside: the distances and lighting make it a hard time for anyone to get away and bandage, so that part of this game is not for this map. And what I really don't like about this outside part is that it is way too light. Nowhere to hide in the darky shadows, and the few shadows that are available outside don't help much: the background is too light, so you see a black guy. Almost easier to notice. The author wrote he wanted a map for "...stealthy stalking movements...". But you can see everything, so not much of that. No chance of an opponent running by and not noticing you (which I feel is so much fun in lock'n'load). That's too bad I think =((

And then there's nothing high enough to get falling damage (except when you JUMP off the highest building (resulting in a -10 or so), I always have such laughs when during a shootout the opponent slips over the edge....

 <p>

Indoors:

Most of them are simple yet effictive, with stairs up to the roofs and some have a tunnel entrance in the dark! And there are a few dead ends here where you can use your knive to keep up your anatomy knowledge =). Due to the bright light all over the map these are the only places where you can do this and there's nothing more satisfying than have an opponent killed with "just" a knive. And then there is the larger building: the author has given this some nice attention. There are glass panels set up nicely so you have to chage your strategy in order to kill. And the lighting is pretty dark, so some surprise actions are to be expected here! Especially up on the higher platform where you can pick off both fighting dudes at the glass panels. And still take cover bihind the blocks there. And also shoot some others who are outside through the shooting holes in the wall there.

  <p>

Weapons:

There has gone some thinking in the placement of the weapons. For example: just before the maze you have the MP5 so that when once you're inside and get attacked from above you can bite back here! Furthermore is the lack of the M4 (at least I couldn't find it) a big plus! It would dominate at all times. There's only one thing though....why is almost all the ammo placed in doubles? And often next to the weapon too. ? So you pick up the MP5 AND 2 extra clips for it giving you a 90 bullets to spread around. That's a bit unbalancing here.

  <p>

Conclusion:

I think it is a good map that should provide good gameplay and FUN. There has been done some thinking first and I like (and appreciate) that. Although there is a little lack of a theme (another city-ish map) here. But if you're into shooting where you need to aim too, get this one. If you have an original style of playing (killing) get this one. If you like to run and shoot, get this one. If you're into moody lurking, stealthy moving, surprising action, wait for aqnitro2 or a more proper name the sequel could go by.

<b>Review:</b><br>

This is my first review, but since I have logged at least a 1000 of hours playing AQ2, I think I have a good idea about which maps are good/fun to play/etc.. and which ones you should delete from your action.ini.  <p>

First, I'd like to say that I know how hard map making is, and most map makers should get an "A" for effort, in just attempting to make a map.  Now... On with the review.  This map, is what my LAN budies and I call, our favorite map.  The basic layout is a rock enclosed, rectangle.  Inside this rectangle are 4 buildings, some mounds and a small maze.  The largest building occupies a corner, as does the maze and one of the smaller buildings, so things are spread out.  There is a bridge that runs over the maze to the large building from the corner.  The streets are green grass and a have a couple of wall like things  to duck behind for cover.  Each building has an accesable roof and a way to move throught the building.  In the last corner are some mound things and "The Stairway to Heaven" which is a stairway up the side of the map that appears to go nowhere, but is a pretty good sniping spot.  

Now, for the weapons.  There is no M4 or Sawed off shotgun here, instead, there is an additional sniper rifle and an additional MP 5/10.  The weapon placement is pretty good, everything is fairly well spread out.  The only thing I don't like is that there is ammo for every wepon, except the shotgun, right next to where the weapon spanwns.  There is not a whole lot of ammo on this level, a little with the weapons, some pistol clips scattered and about 4 or so grenades in various places.  This is a fast-paced map, you almost always have to move around on this one.  With so many spots, and with each being accesable from just about anywhere, you always have to watch your back.  This is where my friend set his first all-time frag record at 72, which he has surpassed and reset at 104 on Building 17, bastard ;)<p>

As for keeping with the theme of Action Q2, this map strays a little from the path, but there are only so many Real Life  structures that can be built before original ideas come back again.  With the wide variety of areas, this map caters to most player types.  I like to snipe, and do well on this map, one of my buddies is a MP5 man, and he does well also, so overall, I think this is a very good map and I rate it 9/10 for gameplay, 7/10 for looks, 10/10 for overall fun factor.  That comes to 8.7/10 overall, which is not too bad.  Thanks for reading my review and thanks to David Munroe ofr his excellent map.

<b>Review:</b><br>

 The more maps I play the more I like this map.

 For teamplay concerns this is a very underrated map, not many servers carry it in rotation. However it has very fast fps rates, very good lighting and an excellent combo of sniper and close in work like few maps I have seen. A few blind corners mixed with a good spread of rooftops and groundcover make this a map where you have alot of kill zones but no dominating area.<p> The map is basically 4 zones, theres some hills in one corner, a maze in the next an area with two buildings and a tall building with a sniper platform. The zones all have excellent access to each other, good views and great cover. in addition all the buildings are accesible, there is a sewer between two buildings and glass partitions in the main building.

 The only real complaints I have are that the sky is too low to jump from the sniper deck and that the maze should have taller walls to force snipers to go onto the catwalk to get you instead of the sniper deck.<p>

 for teamplay this map rocks, good defensible locations and yet enough cover and alleys with exits that no place is impregnable. I would give this an 8 out of 10 and say it's very much equal to blockwar only smaller!
