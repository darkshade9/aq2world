<b>Review:</b><br>

 Ok, I admit, I'm a HUGE Austin Powers:International Man of Mystery and love Korn's got the life, so if this review seems a little biased well it should be no surprise. Quite simply, in terms of effects, this map is pretty cool. 

<p>

The Map has Dr. Evils base, a giant fort divided into seperate rooms (including Scott Evils room with Korn blarring out of the speakers.) There's an outside area which is pretty bland except for the fact that there's Austin's jumbo jet, complete with roatating bed =)

<p>

The rooms are tight, the corridors small and spaces are cluttered making for some cool fire fights. However the desgn doesn't seem to lend itself to teamplay very well. As Cliffe suggest this would make a great DM map but not much else. It almost seems the authour spent more time on making the cool effects rather then design. This looks nothing like Dr. Evils lair. Where's the drill area? Ill Temepered Sea Bass Tank? Fembot holding aread? While I know it would be difficult to recreate the actual moie set it would be nice to see something from the actual movie (other then the jumbo jet.) 

<p>

Gripes aside this is a fun DM map. Pick it up.

<p>

(The autin powers sounds are cool to by the way)

<b>Review:</b><br>





Well my first impressions of this map were first "How the hell did he know that Gary [my mate] wanted Dr. Evil's base!!!!!!" My friend was trying to get me to make such a level but I said it would be crap for teamplay etc and ther would be no point. The author's inventiveness of making the entire base is quite admirable and i think it would play pretty nicely under any conditions.<P>


Plenty of cover, weapon layout is good, not too big or small, excellent framerates...however, the map looks like shit in some places and it could have been better with just a little thought, otherwise, I look forward to playing this map on a server as soon as i can. Cool sounds btw! :)

<b>Review:</b><br>





 Kick F*&#Kin ass man. 

<p>

As I tend to do, I entered this level with a negative additude preparing to compare it to Chris's prior map, Chris city when I saw that he had made it.

<p>

But I loaded it up tonight, to check it out since it's not on any servers just to take a look and I think it fulfill's a lot of need's in an AQ2 map.

<p>

Concept:  the concept is great, based first of all on one of the greatest movies of all time, which is about time when were' talking about the particular mod at hand.  Being as how it is Dr. Evil's Lair, out in the desert, and Austin's plane landing in, I assume that in team games, the starting positions will be over by the plane, and then in Dr. Evil's Lair.  

<p>

This goes in towards a great game of base defense, with seperate sniping locations outside the front door that it seems can only be accesed from inside the compound.  

Then of course there is an assortment of doors that must be accessed through some switch that isnt right there by the door.  This is pretty cool, cause you never know who's right around the corner =o)

<p>

Also, there are serveral other things that are just damn sweet about this map, the little tid bits, and extras here and there make it some good gaming.  All the sounds from Austin Powers put in the game, (I.E. Austin Powers private jet:  "Do I make your horney?"  hehe

<p>

and of course there's the iron maidens from Reg Quake2 single player, converted into the bimbo bots, inviting Mr. Powers into the bed =o)

<p>

hehe trust me you gotta see for yourself.

<p>

Along with the conferance room that explodes, Scott's room with a blasting Stereo, Security Rooms, the Drill Room, a Prison, Toxic waste Trap, lazers, and a switch that will detonate the whole damn lair if certain switches are hit in unison, this level puts the capital "S" in tha Shiznet!

<p>

I mean the colors are great, the desert landscaping is greatly done, I have nothing to complain about in this level.  Its funny, great, and fun, =o)  and this is with out even playing on a server yet, =P

<p>

If you do not play this level, you must pay ........One Million dollars. 

<p>

you get the idea,

<b>Review:</b><br>



 This is a nicely done level. So many tricks, traps and gags around every corner that you'll fall in love with this map the first time you play it. Though...it does get real old real fast but I always get a kick out of the evacuation button! (you'll see what I mean when you play it!) This map is kind of DM and teamplay. I say this because in DM there's tons of places to hide and such but it's good in teamplay because there's a nice security room where you can track anyone down if they're in the building so all those players that have died already don't have to wait for 2 lamers to wait each other out.



<p>

Textures and lighting: 6/10<Br>

Structure: 7/10<Br>

Weapons and Ammo placement: 5/10 (The M4 is hard to get to)<Br>

Gameplay: 8/10 (pretty good 1 vs 1)<Br>

Framerate: 10/10 (didn't have any slow downs during the game at all...and I have a 166 32 meg)<Br>

Overall: 8/10 (Well done Chris!)<Br>

<b>Review:</b><br>





 OK 2nd review and its late night so if you make fun of me, tell me! I wna know what the hell im doing worng.

<p>

First Comment:Yeah baby Yeah

Features:

that control room with the lights showing who's were is Porbably the Greatest thing since the dart board in asylum! The acid chamber :) i wana burn some people! now, about the room with the expoldeing chairs, i Semi-disagree, first the pad should be ON the table, and 2,d not only should they expolde, BUT the chairs should fall down into a lava pit for someone to fall into incase they get the great idea of ducking :) Now the self destruct mechinisim, i didnt figure that out yet... yet. (am I the only one that looks at the readme's?) The Freze chamber, well done, well i looked good but it was good to put a small amout of damige comeing form that "pod"

For the Features in this map:10/10

<p>

Second comment:Do i make you horney? Do I?

Structure:

What could a Austin powers level be without the love plane? (or whatever it was named) that rotateing table(ok its a bed) is just too cool, but I didnt know that pillows could smash you against the wall :( Ok lets leave the plane and get on were the REAL map is, ok the structre, id have to give a 8/10 not the best ive seen but not the wost. and on the plane, on the top of it is a M4 clip, how the hell do you get it? (i used noclip for testing sake)

<p>

Third comment:Do you wana shag baby?... I mean do you wana Frag baby?

Gameplay:

Havent played it yet but looks like its gona be one hellofa frag fest!  There were only a few annoences i came acros such as the doors you open with that hand pad, on one side you cant open the door :( that couls cuk if your being chaned with only a pistol and someone has a MP5 on your tail. for DM im gona give it a 8/10 and for Teamplay a 8/10

<p>

Fourth Comment: the laughs are as plentyfull as the frames

Frame rates:

well i didnt notice too much of a choke on my P133 (software mode) so id have to give it a 9.5/10 for software render users (there should be 2 catigorys, one for software render and one for GL)

<p>

Fith Comment: Its a man baby! (no its not its the lighting)

Lighting:

Well lit in the places it needed to be and nicely dim in the other places, i ahve only one place that i didnt like, the tunnel from the outside chack by the plane to the jail, it should have been darker so im gona give it a 8/10.

<p>



Weapons Placement:

Finally! a map with 2 shotguns! gota love it. I gave APbase a 9/10 for weapons placement, on the ammo however, the ammo was too uncommon, a few clips here and there with another magizne ould be nice.(too bad that little pea shotter wasnt hidden somewhere in the level.. or is it?) 

<p>

Overall:

Mr bigglesworth is back at it again, (well first time in Action Quake) with lots of humor and plaenty of frag's to go around, Id give it a overall of 9/10 If you can find a funnyer map than this one, submit it to AQMD!

<p>

If you hated the movie, its not my fault, i didn't make it :)

<b>Review:</b><br>



This map was made with an Austin Powers theme. I can't say that I have ever seen the movie, but I have over time learned (mostly from the trendy sayings it provoked) the basic feel and sound of the movie (uh.. that make sense??).

<p>

This map is comparatively a medium-large map. Plenty of room to move around, with a good balance of small areas and large areas. Inside the base, very tense pistol and/or knife battles can take place in the halls. Plenty of rooms are around for one to hop in and hope for a few moments to bandage; many of the rooms serve tactical purposes as well (including two rooms with power switches). There are four levels within the base (jail is at bottommost, freezing machine is at topmost). Outside allows plenty of room for running around.

<p>

The environment of the map keeps the darkness of Quake2 alive and is still able to add a lot of humour (ex: two Bitches sitting on a bed, waving, and saying something).

<p>

Weapon placement: clever, and in most cases tactful. The better weapons are usually in a place where it would be dangerous to go (the M4 is in a chamber where, at the push of a button, can be filled with toxic slime).

<p>

Respawn points are good. For teamplay at least one of the respawn points *could* cause sticking (like in teacher), but overall should not be a problem.

<p>

I haven't found any problems with this map. Chris is obviously an awesome mapmaker. I didn't lag anywhere (of course, I do have a 333 MHz machine), tho the sounds could prove to be a problem for even 266 MHz machines. I'll have to give this map a 9 out of 10 instead of a 10 due to the fact that I haven't played it DM or teamplay yet.. and because I was rushed to finish this review.

<b>Review:</b><br>



Ok, i when i write a reveiw, its on behald of the LOWER END computer users. Those of us who are sans PII 450's and 3d cards. OK now on to the reveiw... I like the idea of Dr. Evil's lair, because i liked the movie (rent it) The textures are kind of Q2ish but then again, its an underground mad scientist base. The airplane outside looks like something outta a cartoon, but i love the rotating waterbed inside, and the sound when you press the button :). I think the outside area with the big rock arch is how the outside area in DESERT should have been, more cover than those STUPID roadblocks. The inside of the base is well made, the compuers actually look like computers. I like the fact that the M4 is nearly unreachable (you try to get itm, you get burned with acid) It runs surprisingly good on my 166 and it is a lot of fun in DM. I havent played it in Team Play yet but it looks like a lot of fun. I just came from playing with [ZOID]God Incarnate and he said a lot of people are bashing on the map. I dont want to bitch or anything but if HALF of the people out there knew how HARD, FRUSTRATING and AGONIZING making a map is, they wouldnt have anything to say but good things...ok well i'll just put my soapbox away and give the overall rating

<p>

9/10 - i took a point away because i wish i would have thought of this level myself ;)
