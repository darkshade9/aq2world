<b>Review:</b><br>

 The Town - This map feels a little cramped when you enter it, and is not very big at all. But the detail in this map is INCREDIBLE! The bookshelves have books, the doors have screens, and the trucks are very well done. I like the feeling that something disasterous just went through the town, the doors smashed in, crates flipped, ect. I really enjoyed this map and recommend it highly.

<p><hr noshade><P><b>Review:</b><br>

I have to disagree with Limbcutter's review. This map is detailed, true. But, is detail really a good thing in a Deathmatch map? No, it's not.

<p>

Especially in this map.

<p>

The textures are shocking - the author freely acknowledges that he's ripped off a large number of textures from 3D Realms. Build engine textures do *not* fit in the Quake2 engine. They are horribly pixellated and don't fit the crispness of Quake.

<p>

The level itself is terrible. Many crates which should be easily jumpable are inaccessible. It is an exercise in frustration to attempt to leap onto buildings as the crates are extremely picky in what they will allow.

<p>

Not a very fast deathmatch level at all - much too cramped for a gunfight.

<p>

I would *not* recommend this level, except as something to look at in the lunchbreak.

Intro : Action Quake 2 is all about the movies. The best action movies are the ones with the exciting settings. When I say exciting I don't mean battling it out across a the grand canyon with air to ground missle launchers on your shoulders. The kind of action movie settings that are exciting are the ones that you recognise and can relate to. Here Mr.Abusdal does everything in his power to bring you the most exciting Action Quake2 level I have ever played.

<p>

Design : Mr.Abusdal obviously decided to make this small and detailed as opposed to large and crap :). Everything here is carefully done so that it'll get caught in your legs and immobilize you when you least expect it. Very realistic in other words. This however can be easily avoided after playing the level afew times. You quicly learn how to negotiate that little mound of chairs near the bathroom or that upturned keg near the alleyway. I found that when I did get stuck I'd simply stop look down and admire the bueaty of what I had caught up in. Mostly quaint little chairs of boxes.

<p>

Gameplay : All the weapons are postioned perfectly. I don't think there's any problem in that field. When playing 1on1 I was constantly postioning myself in different areas just 'cos I thought ; "wowa, wouldn't it be dead cool if I shot him from here after jumping silently down off the roof?". I'd run along with the wrong weapon just so I could jump up on the car, change to akimbo pistols and unload them both in me friends face forthe ulitmate action movie kill. Seriously the best gameplay for 1on1 in ANY Action Quake2 map. More than 5 people wouldn't be advised but would probably be a good laff :).

<p>

Bugs/Mistakes : I found that when on roof of one buidling (which had Sniper Rifle on it) the sky was so low I couldn't jump up cos I'd hit my head off it. Also I think that when in house with bathroom, table with candle and kitchen the back window should be big enough to get out of. It'd be a brilliant escape route when being chased. This may not be a bug or mistake but it'd just be better :). Also I'd like to point out that in this map I didn't really run into the 'agh, glass I can't brake, I believe I'm extremly annoyed' feature. The glass that it does have is already broken so I didn't really feel the urge to shoot at it. Future map makers be warned! Unbreakable glass is a NO, NO!

<p>

Overall : Simply the best for 2-5 players. Really gets you in the action movie mood. I'd love if Mr.Abusdal could do another version of it and fix up some of the little things I mentioned. But if he won't I'll sure be playing it every day wishing he would :).

<p>

Rating : 8/10 (I rate hard, GET THIS MAP NOW!)
