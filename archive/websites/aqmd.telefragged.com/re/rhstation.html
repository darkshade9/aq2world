    Architecture & Layout score</b> 8/10 <br>

    <b>Commentary:</b><br>

    Good layout, it is just a little like the other city type maps, but original 

    in its own write. I cheated, i had a sneak peek when i got it from there sight. 

    Im guessing this is a lot like the actual city. </font></font></p>

  <p align="left"><b>How It Looks score</b> 8/10 <br>

    <b>Commentary:</b><br>

    Good job Igor. I can tell why you chose this, is you clan German based? Well 

    any, it looks good and my hats off to yah. 

  <p align="left"><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 8/10 <br>

    <b>Commentary:</b><br>

    Just the same as any map. Teamplay fun factor is good, especially with the 

    size. Mostly, if the map has places to go, hide and have a skirmish, its good. 

  <p align="left"><b>Ambiance score</b> 7/10 <br>

    <b>Commentary:</b><br>

    Couldve been better, but we cant expect everyone to do everything perfect. 

    Its still a great map, but it could be a little more happier. 

  <p align="left"><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

    This map goes in the Golden Vault along with the other classic maps. Its one 

    of the best ive seen, but thats just me, i could be wrong. 

  <p align="left"><b>Overall score:</b> 8/10

    </font></font>This map is great, as long as your normal method of playing 

    is to turn off your monitor and randomly fire your gun till you die. The long 

    brightly-lit hallway is a death zone with two HEAVILY shadowed buildings on 

    both sides, great for campers and sniperts, which tend to abound when playing 

    this map. A good point was that there were no secure places on the map at 

    all, it was all almost completely open, which means usually that you die from 

    being shot in the back of the head. I only played this map on teamplay (I 

    don't play in deathmatches), and it wasn't good for teamplay at all. Maybe 

    DM, I wouldn't know. Overall: 6/10 <br>

    </font>This map is cool...some dark areas and some very nice sniping hang 

    outs...Also a good mix of light and darkness. Fighting in the dark all the 

    time is lam..but when you have a great mix of dark areas plus lighted...very 

    cool.. I love this map..Out of the last three new maps...midtownx, police, 

    and rhstation...this one rocks....Hopefully more servers will have this in 

    their rotation...ha <br>

  Hey all! This is Sir PooP From LT. reviewing RHSTATION By Igor[Rock]. As I first 

  when through the map I noticed all the small black and dark areas in shadows... 

  These spots look tempting for campers. So you may encounter a few campers while 

  playing. As I explored I saw some great textures and originality. From the benches, 

  walls, doors and floors, everything looked like a real station. The only bad 

  thing in the art, I beleive, is the sky. It is very plain. Even the mapdepot 

  provides some sky textures. This sky truly stinks! Maybe Igor was trying to 

  keep the file size of the map low, who knows?! Speaking of the file size.. it 

  is small! That is great! All the detail included, it is awesome that the file 

  size isn't huge! I also noticed that this map would be better if used in deathmatch. 

  The map doesn't have many floors, it was basically leveled. It is pretty much 

  open and not large enough for teamplay. If you were to play teamplay you can't 

  have much fun with this map. There are no great hiding places or other areas 

  that make teamplay maps what they are. The weapons placement is also great in 

  this map. You have to know where to look. Through small corners and tight areas 

  by boxes, ammo/weapons can be found. The framerates seems to be good on my 4mb 

  3d card. I give this map a B+! If you are a huge DM crazed maniac, get this 

  map! It will rock on DM! -=I'm Out=- </font>

  Structure & Design: Very Good idea, I think A worthy enhancement To the original 

  Hallways - A bit too thin for my comfort, I want to be able to overtake someone 

  while running down the hallway. Outdoors: GREAT good open area for general meelee's 

  - Only problem is the light on the right side of the building (while facing 

  it), the color, I think, Is a bit off Room Design: like other maps, with the 

  exception of teacher.bsp, the majority of the rooms were relativaly bland, but 

  I liked the 3rd floor - nice spot to hide & bandage. A few surprises of rooms, 

  but just that, a few Texture work: Walls are a bit bland, especially indoors. 

  (Sorry, but solid blue isn't a good color) Structure: 8/10 Design: 7/10 Weapons 

  Placement: M4: Good, accessible Spot MP5: Well hidden, but Quick to get to Handcannon: 

  See MP5 Shotgun: See Handcannon Sniper rifles: Well hidden, hard(er) to get 

  to 8/10 Item Placement: Bandolier: Easy to get to, but hidden. Kevlar Vest: 

  Same as above, but the door on the jail cell pushes it back into the wall....bad 

  design Lasersight: See kevlar vest (both in the jailcell) Silencer: well hidden, 

  but easy to get to 6/10 - Sorry, the vest pushing is BAD Gameplay: Looks like 

  it will be a fun teamplay (mebbe 3 on 3) map, or a 8-Player Melee map, more 

  than that would be crowded. 8/10 Looks good with the exception of repetitive 

  textures & colors ummm, no comments on framerate, as I gave My monster to a 

  freind about 2 months back, I don't think I can provide a good estimate. Overall 

  Score: 8.5/10 <br>

  </font>This is my first review, so don't kick my ass if I'm saying shit here 

  ;) OK my review subject is "Rockheim Station" (rhstation) by Stefan Giesen alias 

  Igor[Rock]. The map is obviously intended to resemble a German village train 

  station, and it does well. But let's go step by step. Architecture: The map 

  is a mid-size map and basically consists of a huge station building and a small 

  outdoor part with the tracks and platforms. Let's come to the constructive criticism 

  :) The whole scale of the map is too small. You'll kinda feel like Gulliver 

  when playing it. When walking around outdoors, you can just get through the 

  small space below the clocks and "next train" signs. I also wasn't able to jump 

  on top of the platform roof when I tried it in the local station here, but this 

  isn't bad actually because it adds to tactics and gameplay. The building consists 

  of three floors. The ground floor sports some ticket desks, defective toilets 

  and a snack bar. The second floor consists of a round hallway with doors leading 

  to several rooms. Stefan has put some nice gags in here, check it out. The third 

  floor is very small and basically a room with some windows. Jumping out of the 

  windows, you can run around on the second floor roof and snipe some passengers 

  off. ;) The exterior area is small and consists of the platform and a backyard. 

  The track texture was a good idea, it greatly reduces poly count. I would have 

  liked electrical wires over the tracks though, they would make snipers watch 

  out. 7/10 Textures: The textures are well aligned and perfectly fit the theme. 

  The signs are all in German, but that won't disorient international Quakers 

  :). Nice work here. 9/10 Weapon placement: There's one piece of each on the 

  map, I couldn't find the shotgun though. You gotta do some search to get the 

  weapons, but sadly Stefan has put the M4 on the silver plate, just waiting to 

  be wielded. There's just the right amount of ammo on the map. 7/10. Lighting: 

  Lighting is moody and well done, but some areas inside the building are just 

  too dark. 9/10. Framerates: r_speeds are in the lower 600s outdoors, and often 

  get < 50 indoors. Good work here. The map is perfectly playable on my PII/266 

  with Voodoo 1. 10/10. Overall: 8.5/10 Enough talking. Get the map and do a 4-player 

  deathmatch :) PS: Stefan is damn good at writing legal crap. Really, the readme 

  sounds like a Micro$oft EULA ;) <br>

  'Tatort: Rockheim Station at 3:35' leaves little to the imagination (except 

  'Tatort' - which, my dictionary informs me, means 'scene of the crime'). And 

  indeed, this map does leave little to the imagination, preferring instead to 

  recreate in detail the railway station of a small town somewhere in Germany. 

  Let me first get my gripes out of the way. My biggest is that this map is too 

  open to sniping. A sniper may get him/herself up on the roof and never be seen 

  again for the rest of the map. The roof (it's more of a solid balustrade really) 

  is totally in darkness, and therefore a sniper can sit, undiscovered, and snipe 

  away. The good thing about it is the placement of the sniper rifle. It's placed 

  so that the sniper will have to expose himself (sorry, bad choice of words) 

  for a while to get to it. And the ammo for it is fairly scarce aswell. I'm not 

  sure what the top level of the train station is supposed to be. There's nothing 

  there except a few empty rooms, all decorated in the colours of the German flag. 

  It reminds me a little of a more cramped version of Hostile Takeover. Anyway, 

  on to the good points. The map has a varied selection of areas. If you fancy 

  a wide battle area, go out onto the tracks. If you prefer close, tense firefights, 

  come inside. If you like running around, you can do that all around the station 

  aswell. Weapons are placed fairly randomly around the level (some rooms have 

  no purpose except to store a weapon, which I don't really like) and most of 

  them are represented. I'm not sure how well this map would lend itself to teamplay. 

  It's not a small map, but it's easy to find everyone, so I think any more than 

  6-7 players would be too many. It's ideal for 2 on 2's. The attention to detail 

  isn't bad - outside, the signs are clear and the tracks look realistic, but 

  inside is fairly barren. For such an open map, r_speeds are good - on my 24mb 

  P133 with 3dfx the highest I noticed were about 800. Overall, a solidly built 

  map that's just a bit too dark for my liking. But it's still a playable map 

  that deserves credit. <br>

  A lovely piece. The scale of doors etc. may seem small but just compare the 

  models with the surroundings and you see it really fits well. The idea is great, 

  and with all the vast maps around, a small, but complex map was a nice and welcome 

  surprise. The textures are just sweet, mind the dark places, this map brings 

  the station alive.<br>

  What i like the most is the accesibilty (is that a word?) to all the areas in 

  the map: fortify in the building with your team, and there are tens of entrances 

  they can come though. This map really makes you move, they could be anywhere! 

  A real challenge to the team to work on, and a brainstorm in figuring out how 

  to secure your back. And you can use _any_ weapon available in this map, snipe 

  on the roof, HC hunt incide the station, spray away at the tracks, all types 

  of game play are supported.<br>

  I hope more servers start running this map soon, and i am talking about TP, 

  if you put your mind to it, this one can be very enjoyable. Fast pased action!<br>
