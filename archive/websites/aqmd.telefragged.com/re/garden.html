<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>Well, it's a maze all right. It's really easy to get lost at first, but after awhile you should be able to find a route to the center. The only thing that seems out of place is that underwater passage with the M4.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>Grab a friend or two, then start shooting! Whoever gets to the center first would supposedly end up w/ an advantage because it's the perfect spot to snipe from...

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>The bird calls fit in perfectly. You turn a corner and hear a bird chirp, or run past a spot and hear a different bird call.

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>There are no real weapon combinations that can be over-used, except maybe a sniper and vest while on the tower. A machine gun user has just as much chance as a shotgunner.</FONT><P>

          Architecture & Layout score</b> 8/10 <br>

          <b>Commentary:</b><br>

          I really got a kick outta the layout of this level.I have always loved 

          mazes,and this map is the first and only level I've seen with a nice 

          hedge maze.The maze itself is well layed out,and I like the touch of 

          the tower in the center with the SR inside.The underground passage is 

          quite a nice touch,and it was how I got to the tower when I looked around 

          for the first time.The only thing about this that could be considered 

          flawed,is that it's *VERY* easy to get lost.But this is a characteristic 

          of any real hedge maze,so it's not the fault of the level or the mapper. 

          Still,a very well planned layout. </font></p>

          <b>Commentary:</b><br>

          The layout fits with a sort of Labyrinth(If anyone has seen that movie) 

          kind of setting,with rich textures,and a good feel .The lighting is 

          done well,and is nice and even.I liked the sky texture,but I think maybe 

          it was a little too spartan.The various places to find the toys are 

          also interesting,like the HC in the blue treasure chest,and the grenade 

          on the roman column pedestal. </font>

          <b>Commentary:</b><br>

          I loved the flow of the level,and am going to look for a server running 

          this.Though I doubt the auto-monkey's will like this level much,the 

          HC and knife users will love the narrow passages.I scored this level 

          high b/c one of my favored weapons is the HC,and I *LOVE* cramped,narrow 

          passages :-) That combined with the sniper fun to be had on the tower 

          has made this one of my favorite levels.The only problem I can see is 

          the tower top is very defensible.Just close both the doors on the tower,and 

          you can hear anyone coming your way,making them easy meat(Unless you 

          suck,anyway). I don't mind that personally,b/c I love the SR as well.

          <b>Commentary:</b><br>

          The level just *oozes* medieval charm.I love mazes,and medieval architecture,so 

          I love the mood this level presents.The sky is a nice touch,but I would 

          have prefered a sky with castles in the distance,or something....I don't 

          know who made it,but the sky that goes perfectly with the level is the 

          Desolation Island sky. I also liked how there's a bird that randomly 

          chirps in the level as well.Too often do I check out a map solo,and 

          hear only the resounding falls of my own feet.Mappers:Put sounds in 

          the levels! </font>

        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

          I love this level,and if I must trim my maps folder,I will definately 

          keep this map.As I've pointed out,I love mazes and cramped passages.Anyone 

          who shares these likes will most likely enjoy this map. Kudos to it's 

          author! </font>

          Architecture & Layout score</b> 4/10 <br>

          <b>Commentary:</b><br>

          The garden is nice and intricate, and the tower is always visible, but 

          you never seem to get closer to it no matter how hard you try. The sewers, 

          though not exactly a secret, are difficult enough to get to considering 

          the maze that I'm not sure it's going to help any. </font></p>

        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>How It Looks score</b> 6/10 <br>

          <b>Commentary:</b><br>

          It's a hedge maze... not that much you can do with it. For what it's 

          worth Jesus makes a reasonable representation of one, but nothing really 

          stands out here. </font>

        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 4/10 <br>

          <b>Commentary:</b><br>

          It's bad. Not quite awful, but still bad. I do enjoy surprising people 

          and worrying about my death every time I turn a corner, but this is 

          taking it to the extreme limit. There's no chance for stratergy or planning 

          here unless you've completely memorised the maze. It would have been 

          nice if the hedges were slightly below eye level so we could see the 

          paths AND where other people are, but be unable to shoot them. Right 

          now though, it's not much more than a game of luck. </font>

        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Ambiance score</b> 8/10 <br>

          <b>Commentary:</b><br>

          The garden setting is fantastic, evoking a real sense of fantasy and 

          wonder, the mountains, the sky, the bird calls, all are really wonderful... 

          unfortunately it's not the right kind of environment for AQ, our action 

          movie bloodbath simulator. Still, I'm going to rate this map highly 

          on this point alone. </font>

        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Other:</b><br>

          The file seems a little bloated considering it's 1.2 megs and given 

          the complexity (or lack thereof) of the level. </font>

        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

          An interesting idea with wonderful atmospherics, hampered by the overly 

          complex maze and the fact that it's not the right feel for AQ. </font>
