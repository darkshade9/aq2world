<b>Review:</b><br>

ok lets break it down: 

textures: wonderful...except for one place...inside the movie room itself, yucky..comes to mind. A very drab grey color for the walls definately could have been a different more realistic or just plain better looking color.I mean how many movie theaters have you been in that have grey cinder block walls??

every othere texture is very very nice. Espacially those used for the bathroom!

<p>

creativeness: This level has been thought of many times before...but  Harrison seems to hit it right on the nose. Wonderful creative use of his mind. I mean.....the big sign outside(colorful)....the bathroom....a GREAT looking but small snack bar.This artist in harrison really came out for this level.

the car prefab was nice too...common , but a very nice touch.

 <p>

weapon placement: The weapon placement is just fine. The sniper rifle can be an exersize in futility to obtain,,,,oh man....but it is really worth getting a hold of for this little level. Harrison has created a snipers heaven and not to mention knifers heaven on the roof top. Excellent darkness and shadows just where you need them. The weapon are spread out very evenly so it doesnt make for one man to get all the goodies when he spawns in.

<p>

r_speeds: to get lagged on this level your gonna have to be running a pentium 100 w/8 megs of ram and a 14400 modem. I found the r_speeds to be very forgiving and very reasonable.

<p>

overall: The level is definately made for a 2 to 6 person shoot out, It can make an excellent one on one practice level  for all you clanners out there. This map definately should get a lot more attention than it does. Big and wonderful things come in small packages, There you have it. Download and enjoy.<br>

<b>Review of Cinema:</b><br>



 Cinema's simplicity is both it's greatests asset and biggest liability, making this map decent, but not great.

<p>

Cinema's pluses are diverse areas, unique level design and great look and feel. The level is divided into 4 basic areas. An outside area, fairly open with a truck, an downstairs area, failry open, an upstairs area, again open, the cinema, a great "hide and shoot" area and a crammped bathroom stall where crazy fights break out over the M4. Cinema is small so the fights are fast and furious thus making them very intense. Little goodies like a lock on the bathroom and the cool escalators add varitey to the level. 

<p>

However Cinema has a few problems. Ammo is VERY limited, to illustrate there's only one box of shells! So i suggest you bone up on you pistol skills. Camping can become rampant due to this. I remember one game where the majourity of the unique weapons and items wound up in the bathroom and there was one guy just standing there with the M4. Also since the level is so small you usually respawn in the middle of fire fights.

<p>

If you like tight, mad, crazy games i suggest picking up Cinema right away, you won't be dissapointed.<br>

<b>Review of Cinema:</b><br>

 I was forced to write this review, since everytime "Cinema.bsp" rotated onto the server about 10 messages would float by that basicially say "This levels sucks". Folks, it does suck. It is *WAY* too small and because of this, all of the weapons end up at the feet of some guy in the far bathroom stall wielding a hand cannon. 

<p>

Part of the problem is the lack of grenades. But most of the fault lies in just the area being *TOO SMALL* for anything more than a duel. 

<p>

If you want "Fast paced respawn killing action" then you want this map... Well no, you want another map that's better, but you get the idea :)

<p>

All in all I wish the server administrators would QUIT putting this map in the rotation, especially with more than a five person limit.
