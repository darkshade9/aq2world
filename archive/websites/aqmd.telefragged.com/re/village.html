<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR> Ok, It's a medival type village thing, which is a good idea, but i think could've been better. It's a big field basically, with a few houses, a church, a graveyard, this stone maze thing, and some other buildings. The buildings are simple for the most part. Oh yeah, there is a big tree. The doors are annoying sometimes too, they are hard to get out of. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR> Not enough textures. Grass, stone, and wood. I that there was a big tree, but trees look crappy in q2. The lighting was very bright, with the exception of the church. It was pitch black in the back of it, which was odd. (I use software mode, so maybe it looks better opengl) The sky was the normal q2 sky, which was kinda strange to look down from this village to big spacy buildings. I also don't like the way it's like...the grass ends and suddenly its sky. Like you should just fall off into oblivion. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Rating:</B> 5 /10</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR> I'm saying 5 because I haven't played it multiplayer, so I can't say either way, but there isn't a tremendous amount of weapons or ammo, so I wouldnt think more than 5. There are some (what looks like) good sniper spots, and maybe some secrets. I haven't totally explored it yet. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 7 /10</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR> Once again, nothing totally awesome, but not horrid. There is a cool crow in the background. So that's worth something. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Other Comments:</B><BR> I think that's about it, but lemme say this, it is supposed to be medival. Action quake is supposed to me movie like. I dont recall seeing any movies set in 1200s with sub machine guns. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR> Ok, lemme first say that I give credit to anyone that makes q2 maps. I haven't tried it, so I can't really tell people they aren't good. And when I give something say, a five, thats not awesome, but it's also not bad. It's average. I think the author could do better. Make it a darker level. Scarier. New textures. </FONT><P>
