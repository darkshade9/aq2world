<b>Review:</b><br>


As soon as I entered this map, I knew it would be good. I saw the ladders leading up from the bottom of the cliff edges, and I saw the Cart that goes across on pulley. This level is gorgeous!! I especially like looking down from the cart when going across, but watch your step! I accidentally slipped off once, and now I know why it's called Cliff. This is a very awesome level, not too big, but I consider it to be a pro-made level. Good going, Ace12ga!

<b>Review:</b><br>


Well, this is my first ever Q2 map review.  A relatively new player to the scene, I hope to make myself a regular to AQMD map reviews so I can give something back to the Quake Community.  So here goes:





Introduction:





You'll expect nothing less with a map created by an A-Team member.  "Cliff" is a cleverly-designed map with very open gameplay and quick thought.  You won't find too many places to catch a breath in this level.


<p>


Structure and Design: 





In terms of structure, the map is basically a small cross-section of a canyon, with a center plateau and two opposing cliffs.  There are big ravines dividing each cliff from the plateau, so any smart folk will know not to hop in (you can, of course, but you will most likely end up in a bloody mess).  To cross, most players will notice the most prominent feature in the level- a two-way pulley cart spanning the entire level.  While it can take you from one end to the other, it is extremely slow, making it an inviting target for snipers and crazy folk that love to do a tightrope act along the topwire and drop grenades into an open ceiling panel.  Speaking of sniping, there is a fairly large hill beside the plateau, allowing view of the entire level w/o getting shot at directly.  Overall it is a surprisingly small, but a well-designed level.  The only problem maybe the size itself, because I can't see playing with more than 6 people in this level w/o having it turn into chaos.  [9.5/10]


<p>


Aesthetics:





The look of the level is great- unless you are sick of rock-brown and grey metal as the basic motif of the area.  It will be a great advantage to those using something like the "Desert Terrorist" skin.  I guess my only complaint are the shadows in the open canyon.  Now noted, I'm not a mapmaker myself, so I don't know all the technical aspects to that facet of Q2, but there are areas where shadows are broken (i.e. the top wire of the car).  You'll probably never notice it in normal play, but from this POV it leaves it looking a bit imperfect.  Software and GL players will find it looking clean too, with only moderate ugliness caused by the Software rendering dither (I must say it looks much better than "Lock n' Load" and "Coventry Village" in Software mode).  For being surprising simple, it looks surprisingly well. [9/10]


<p>


Weapons:





Weapons are placed in abtract locations.  This may be a problem to a number of people, but those that are smart enough to go through the level locally will find most of them are actually hidden from plain view.  Ammo is abundant- perhaps too abudant with your standard clips and shotgun shells.  I think this could be damaging to the gameplay and some of the strategic element because most people could go on shooting like a maniac w/o worrying about ammo as it is usually just around the corner. [8/10]


<p>


Gameplay:





Fun!  You may find yourself worrying more about killing yourself than shooting others, than some of the Action maps, but that shouldn't affect the general game.  I must point out though that there seems to be an inadvertent tendency to accidentally kill yourself falling from a cliff too many times.  Also, some may get bored of "Cliff" because of it's small size and limited space.  Add it to a regular rotation, however, and you can't go wrong. [8.5/10]


<p>


Overall:


A fun level that is nearly perfect in design and perfectly made for a small group of AQ2 players... you won't be disappointed.  I am really anxious to see this map go into the first pack collection.  [9/10]

<b>Review:</b><br>


I read the other review and was sorely disappointed, so I decided to post my own.  I would just like to say, make sure you are playing a real game before you review.  If you are the only one in a map, it is easy for it to look pretty sweet.  When I first got in this map it was pretty awesome looking, and I was impressed with the pulley car and cliff structure.  Unfortunately it did not hold up to my game play with only my brother, and even worse when a 3rd person joined.  I would think more would just make it worse and worse.  This is not a bad review, mind you.  It is just that this map makes action less "action" and more "woops i fell".





<p>


Structure relative to gameplay: 


<p>Pulley Car:


     Ya, don't even think about using the car to cross the chasm.  You can make the loop around the middle rock jut by moving to the bottom level and going around.  If you are in the car you are basically wasting time when you could be fragging as well as being a sitting duck for gun shots/grenades/snipers/etc.  It looks nice, but it is added brushes without purpose in my opinion.


<p>Sniper Spots:


     I found most if not all of the sniper spots to be rediculously easy to spot/hit.  There is the spot in the middle on top of the jutting rock, an easy spot to hit with a wild pistol shot, making the sniper plummet to his death, there is a spot on a shelf on one side of the middle rock which is equally open, and there are a few others which had no cover.


<p>Aesthetics: 


     Pretty?  yes.  looks nice.  That always adds to a level, but prettiness doesn't add to playability.


<p>


Weapons:


     Lots of ammo down below.  IMHO, stay down there.  You have the run of both sides, all the ammo you need, and you can pick off snipers with your pistol.  Bingo Bango you win.


<p>


Gameplay:


     Ehhhh.  The vest is useless because about any wild shot will knock you off a ledge anyway.  Also, the spawn spots (a few) seemed to be placed just for snipers.  I remember spawning near a stairwell (which i might add is impossible to run down without "jumping" too far and getting hurt) and being picked off repetedly, not because someone was being a camper, but just because i had to watch my step after spawning so I didn't rush off the edge.  With three people we had trouble having a real game.  It got to the point where you had to cram yourself into a corner and shoot so you didn't get knocked off.  I got bored and actually just started running up the main hill in the middle toward the sniper respawn and taking a flying leap to the nether regions of the map. . .good hang time.


<p>


Overall:


     It seems I have said some bad things about this map (lots maybe), but earlier I said this is not a bad review.  Why did I do this?  I did this because I know how hard it is to actually make maps.  I tried a couple of times, and one may someday make it to this page only to be torn apart and bitched at.  This map looked wonderful in theory, but I think playtesting may destroy it.   I do say good job Ace12GA, and sorry for the not so good review.  I think it is a kick ass level for demos and action movies though, so go make 'em here. ..and be dramatic off that pulley car or something.<br>

<b>Review:</b><br>


Just wanted to post a short (but sweet) review of cliff for Teamplay.  Although in Dm this level is a little too much for my P200 to handle with more then 6 people, I played some major teamplay in this level today and had about as much fun as you can have, legally.  The maps layout leads to great strategy, and the high areas of the map are great for those sniping wars.  On the subject of sniping, two or three members of my team were pinned down by a *really* good sniper for most of the game.  It was an utter blast trying to make a "run for it" while watching your teammates disappear in a red spray.  I highly recomend this map for teamplay, for those who want an experience where not only the MP's rule the level, but also the skilled sniper.

<b>Review:</b><br>


I just read the latest Cliff review [zjrunner's], and since I REALLY disagreed to it, I though I should tell you all what I think of the map. Before I start, I think I should tell ya'll that this review is based on many hours of playing this map 2on2 and 3on3 TEAMPLAY mode. I have *NO* idea how it plays in standard DM mode, as I haven't even loaded the map without teanplay set to 1.


<p>


Anyway, This level is quite an original.. As you might have figured out by the name, it all takes place around some cliffs -- and dangarous ones, I might add. You have to watch your steps, cause if you fall down, you're gonna get hurt real bad -- and most likely die. And that's one of the cool parts about this map.. you HAVE to watch your steps. If you don't, well, you're ain't gonna hit the top spot on the scorelist, that's for sure..


<p>


The design of this level is pretty good, although some brushes don't fit well together and stuff like that, but hey, I know how hard it is to create a good looking outdoor area, so I ain't gonna bother saying anything more about that. The cable car connecting the two cliffs is VERY cool, although it's too risky to use it.. still real cool, though. The author has also managed to keep the r_speeds relativly low.. from 300-700. This is pretty good for a level like this..


<p>


There aren't many textures used in this level (besides the cable car thingy) but it still looks good. 


<p>


My final words are: fun, fun FUN! Yes! This level is VERY fun to play on, and none of the 6 guys who were playing it (3 Gl, 3 software) EVER complained.. we loved it, and we still do =)


<p>


I'd rate this level 8\10 - In my book, that's VERY GOOD! Keep it up, dude!

<b>Review:</b><br>


This is my first review, but I plan to start reviewing maps on a regular basis. 


The most important thing in a level is and always should be playability. Is the Level fun?


After all this is still a game and fun should be the number 1 priority.


<p>


Well this Map is becoming one of my favorites, for team play that is. DM is a another story all together.


Now as some people know, I love both the sniper rifle and the mp5. This level is a heaven for both. The sniping is great, the map is basically divided in half and on side has a cliff looking down on the other, This is great for sniping and can make for for a battle of the snipers. <p>


But if sniping isn't your cup of tea so to speak you can always do the sneaking around with an mp5 strategy. I like to run to the other team's base right away and sneak up on snipers that are zoomed in with no backup. The most fun thing you can do is hit a sniper, that is sniping from the edge and wearing a vest, in the chest with you mp5 up close and knock him off of the cliff. I love that. 


Of course what a lot of people hate about this map is the constant threat of falling. Well personally I love it. This is one level where the vest can be a big disadvantage instead of the huge advantage it usually is. 


Another feature I love is the  rail cart or whatever it is. Sniping people in it rules. 


This  is one of the best teamplay levels out there and can make for some REALLY fun games.

<b>Review:</b><br>











Well, I haven't had time to submit much reviews since school started, but I just practiced this map for an hour at a warm up for this weekend's BREAKDOWN. (Not beatdown, name comes from something else) The Breakdown is simply bi-weekly LAN I hold where we all get togather and wish we were in CA at the real BDown. Anyway, Cliffe is BDown IIIs offcial tourney map. And there is a good reason why. The M4 is impossible to find! I can't find it! So I use the mp5! Woohoo! Gotta love those 3 shot bursts now. This map is great with just the way it is, the suicide car for those who misjudge my sniping talents, the nice pits, the absence of the M4 but plenty of ammo! I wont go into details, but I love this map! The Moose returns!

<b>Review:</b><br>


This map is one of my favorite maps for teamplay.  It's small size ensures you don't have to wait for two people to kill each other before the round is over.<p>


   I know that many people see the pulley cart as a bad way to get to the enemy side, but the enemy hardly watches for people coming over on the cart, and I've seen people go over on the cart and shoot the other team in their backs.  I also like to tight rope walk to the other side if the enemy isn't watching me.  


  <p> I'm not a sniper so I love the lack of sniper cover and I also like the idea that the enemy has to protect their snipers backs in order to win.  This map requires good teamplay and those defensive players seem to have a big advantage because if you're sitting still you can't fall off the edge.


 <p>  I love the huge cliffs that kill you if you fall off of them.  It makes it so people just can't strafe all over the place making wild shots and getting lucky and hitting someone in the head.  It requires some kind of thought when you move to not be able to fall off.  


   <p> So overall this is a great map for teamplay, but after reading other reviews may not be a good DM map.

<b>Review:</b><br>


 This is my first review so bare w/ me :)..<br>


This map freakin rocks. First of all I am a sniper and a soloist so see this map from both sides. The author did a great job with the layout of this map, it allows many types of play for every person. It has sniper areas ( a few ) and places where you can sneak up, or pull an all out rambo attack and take everyone out before you recieve bullet to the head :) ( love that ). Personally I hate teamplay but because of this maps layout i can play all day and not get bored. My favorite thing is to jump on the death trolley and crotch down, then if the opposing team doesnt see me , drop down and take out there snipers and campers in that little room.Thats the funniest thing becuase the snipers cant see you while zoomed in unless they look up for some reason, and quaickly you will get 2-3 killz if you quiet. When using this its vbest to use 1 of the 2 automatics, the mp4 or mp5. This map is also one of the most original I have seen yet( those buildings ar egettin old old old). Also with a semi-good computer this map runs very well, so if you want good clean teamplay I suggest this map :)

<b>Review:</b><br>


 I LOVE this map, very original, good for straight dm, me and my friends play it on a lan, and it ROCKS.  I played the map well over a hour and finnaly found out that you can get on top of the cable car (which rules).  I played forever and still was fascinated with the map and the places you could get to.  its not a good snipers map, but you can stay on top of the cliff if you have a few players without being picked off for a good long while.  this level was built for the jump kick.  i would try to kick somebody off the cliff and a little strafing on their behalf sent me over the edge, laughing all the way down.  i got a ton of frags just by throwing people off the ledge.


<p>


the little hump of dirt in the middle underneath the cable car should have a easier way off of it.  other than that, i think this is a top notch level, one of my favorites.  it rules for a lan, its completely hystrical when you kick somebody off of a ledge to send them to their death.


10/10 if you have a lan (3-4 players), get this map<br>

<b>Review:</b><br>





Whoa. This map really resembles the title. It is basically a huge outdoor cliff area, with a cliff in the middle to maintain a playable framerate/ping. I like the placement of the sniper rifle in this map, right on the top of the cliff. There are several ladders at the bottom, and steps to get down from the highest peak.<p>


   What was probably the coolest about this map was the Tram that goes from one side of the map to the other. You can also get on the cable that the tram rides on (one way is hurtful, one is easy, i'll let you find that out yourself). One thing, though, I couldn't find the M4. Anywhere. I've played this map dozens of times, but I have heard several people tell me that an M4 is here. Oh well. The MP5 just 0wns here, once I got it, I was fragging people left and right (mp5 ammo is EVERYWHERE!!). Once someone killed me, My goal was to get the mp5 back. Yes, it's that good here. If you know how to get on the cable, you can find the Mp5. One freaky thing is...if you run up the middle cliff, and try to stop near the top, you don't, you just keep flying ;).


Having fun admins for this map is GREAT. Kicking people off those cliffs is just hilarious!


I give this map a 9/10, great fun, but not so good for people with weaker computers.

<b>Review:</b><br>





 I have played this map several times on DM and Teamplay and to put it bluntly, this map sucks.  I would not recommend that it be downloaded or played on.  Textures and map design are great on this map but gameplay just brings it all down.  Its a great map if you don't mind falling off a 100 foot cliff every 5 minutes.  Everytime I play it I see people getting pissed off because they lose well fought for frags because they fall off a stupid ledge.  I can understand a high dropoff here and there but this is ridiculous.  The map was well thought out and designed very well with nice stair cases and a very nice lift that transports you from one side of the canyon to the other.  If you wanna kill yourself about 10 times a round then this map is for you but I strongly advise against it.


<br>


Score:  3/10
