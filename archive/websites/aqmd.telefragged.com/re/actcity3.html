<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR> While there are problems with this map, it is nevertheless one of the most entertaining and enduring I have played. The flaws are generally minor - about half of the playing area is rarely frequented due to its sparseness of fields of fire and general separation from the centre, and this is only compounded by the limitations of the engine, which result in a player being unable to see one end of the map from the other. However, this pales into significance next to the extreme playability of the central area - good fields of fire, low ping rate and a balanced combination of indoor close range encounters and outdoor, long-range firefights. Especially satisfying is the feeling of tracking an opponent by watching his passage through the open windows, and so preparing to ambush him at one of the doors. The silencer and the grandad slippers are of particular use for this. The only real disadvantage is the!
doors, and their slowing of the pace due to their frequency and swing nature. Overall though, there is very little separating this from the perfect layout. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR> Not too pretty, but functional and appropriate. Some items, such as the payphones and perhaps the windows have been lifted straight out of Duke Nukem 3D, and so look a bit dated. All this aside, though, the buildings are adequately varied and the textures sufficiently realistic to pass muster as a rooftop complex. Finally, particular praise should go to the sky texture, which combined with the low lighting level gives a real gritty urban feel. Lighting is a definite plus all round, in fact - providing a real balance. Do you opt for the more easily covered, indoor areas, where although you are safer you can be more easily spotted? Or do you choose the darker, but more open outdoors, where concealment is of the essence - if you are seen, you are in big trouble. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR> I'd only abstain from giving this level full marks due to the engine, and the fact that snipers cannot see one end of the level from the other. Aside from that, never a dull moment. Respawn points are particularly good, combining instant access to the action with relative concealment, and the option to run rather than fight. The multiple routes around the level also lead to tension, as it is possible to flank an opponent from almost anywhere. Cover is good, furniture doesn't get in the way, all the weapons (even the handcannon) have their uses. In truth, to cast off authorial distance for a moment, this is truly the only map where I have played a two player game and killed my adversary with all of the weapons, even grenades. Nothing has yet beaten my opening a door, throwing a grenade in, closing it and watching the resulting explosion send the target flying out of the window. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 8 /10</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR> Like I said, lighting used to really add something to the game. The lowering sky and the lack of a ground level playing field really add to the sense of a special-ops mission, or a similar terrorist incursion. Many people will merit a map with the statement: 'if you stop for an instant, you're dead' or something similar, but how does this apply in a game with a sniper rifle? Here you add to the game with areas exposed to countless windows, where those who stand still reap obvious benefits until spotted and dealt with. This makes the tension - there is no stronger incentive to think your rash impulses through than the certain knowledge that the courtyard you are about to cross will be peppered with bullets. Actcity 2, the predecessor to this offering and another fine map, held this feeling in a more dilute form, for there the action was tighter, with fewer options and fewer vantage points creating a mor!
e in your face quality. This, though, this is what its all about. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Other Comments:</B><BR> Oh, and did I mention ammo? Sparse, yet thoughtfully placed, this encourages the flowing nature of the level, and players will always have to seek for more whilst conserving their few remaining bullets. If you do run out, though, there are more than enough doorways to leave the action through, and the astute player can all but guarantee himself an escape route from almost any position, to heal and find the all-important pistol clips. Worthy of particular praise is the placement of the sniper ammo, right at the other end of the level from the rifle and in one of the most exposed positions. This means than, while the bolt hole under the rifle promises easy kills for six bullets, beyind that you seriously have to consider your limited options, and it is then that the harassed centrally placed victims of your fire will have revenge. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR> The best map available for this mod, but don't use it with more than four players. One for those private gatherings, but not such a hot option for teamplay. Go it alone against a select handful of veterans, and nothing else you can play will touch it. I don't even play Quake any more, or indeed any other game multiplayer (except the seminal TA). And of all the maps available for Action Quake, this is truly the only one to use. A must for any collection. </FONT><P>

I really hate being shot, and because of the shot fall down in the pit. You should think that the shooter would get a &quot;Shooter shows deadman to fly&quot;?, but noo. The author has made the pit dangerous( like lava, only black), so whatever you do to fall down in there you`ll loose a frag, thats stupid.<br>I guess this is for people who jump/fall down in before Action!, and would have to stay down there for the rest of the round, but couldn`t the author make an elevator or something?<br>I`m voting for a road instead of a black pit.<br></FONT><P>

<p><b><u>REVIEW</u><br>

  Architecture & Layout score</b> 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  It uses a fresh idea in the layout by making all the buildings rise from a deep 

  pit. The buildings all see a common outdoor area with lots of sniper spots and 

  narrow bridges. Of course due to the design falling off any building is extremely 

  dangerous so you really need to be careful when advancing between buildings 

  and when looking out of windows. There are also small indoor pieces of the level 

  which allow access between buildings. The main outdoor area is quite big, making 

  for some nice sniper fights at very long range. The outdoor area is maybe a 

  bit too open making it somewhat non-strategic with not much to hide behind. 

  </font>

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> 7/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The texturing is quite well done with nothing to complain about. Lightning isn't 

  that good, the map is lit in a medium fashion with no dark shadows and no bright 

  spots lying around. It still looks good and is much nicer to the eye than fullbright 

  levels like urban3 and all jungle levels. Still, urban2 beats this one. </font>

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The gameplay on this map seems to become very sniper-oriented. A design bug 

  could be that the main area is too long for at least my GL card to display the 

  full view from edge to another, making sniping a hard time. Otherwise the r_speeds 

  are fine for a map of this size. Since most places have two entrances this map 

  could make for some good TP tactics to storm the enemy team. Unaware snipers 

  will propably get a boot in their ass on this one because the center pit is 

  much too tempting for anyone who manages to sneak in their backs. Being outside 

  is also highly lethal due to the fact that anyone can see you from all the houses 

  around you. TP is very fun in this map but it takes some players for it to function. 

  3on3 - 6on6 should make the best results. I didn't test DM since I didn't find 

  any servers running it so you might want to read the other reviews also. </font>

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> 6/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  No sneaking in shadows on this map. Still it makes you feel the heights and 

  you will learn to fear the falls. Indoor design features nothing special and 

  outdoors you are too busy fragging to worry about ambience. It hasn't yet got 

  the classic feel of urban or actcity2 on it. The lightning is not as good as 

  in actcity2 and it feels like CryptR had sacrificed ambience for complexity 

  and more tactics. It still isn't the main thing on this map so it doesn't matter 

  that much. </font>

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  A very enjoyable map on TP, actcity3 combines urban and actcity to make a good 

  TP map. I think it would have needed a bit more originality on the roofs and 

  insides to create a classic. However all city map addicts should go for it.

  Okay this is my first review... don't kill me too soon : ) The idea behind it 

  is very good. A high towering city level with a huge ravine. Very original. 

  Plus that it's well done makes this a plus point. Windows are placed where they 

  should be etc. The only thing I'm not too fond of is how those bridges look...

  It looks very good IMHO. It gives a very good atmosphere. Perfectly balanced.

  Perfect. Plain perfect. I have a very funny anecdote... I was playing a 1 - 

  1 with my brother. I'm running behind him shooting with my pistol on him. I 

  get a bit closer and kick him. I thought he flew through the window, so I take 

  a look out of the window and... BANG. A shot in the back and I fall down... 

  Really funny, not that it's relevant. I just mean that the map is perfectly 

  balanced and... kicks ass!!! </font>

  I like the flow of this map. At first I found it hard to get to the sniper rifle, 

  but then I found out the shortcut of going out the sliding glass doors of the 

  apartment and jumping the rail. I like how there's lots of jumping from roof 

  to roof. The walkways are relatively small, and I can't think of anywhere in 

  real life where there would be concrete walkways connecting roofs, because there 

  just isn't. But it's cool anyways. </font>

  Nothing special here, but it works. I don't know what it is about me, but I 

  like how stuff looks in Quake2 when it's under a blue light. It looks cool, 

  and there's a hall with only blue lights. That automatically bumps this up a 

  notch. Hehe. I didn't try it in software mode, but I imagine it looks fine.

  Oh man, the layout is amazing. The whole rooftop idea is awesome. While watching 

  for snipers, you also want to watch your step. Speaking of snipers, there are 

  enough places for snipers that cover a decent bit of area, but you don't want 

  to stay there too long. This isn't a camper's map. Once again, the rooftops 

  are great. </font>

  The textures and buildings are nothing new,(unless you haven't played any of 

  the urban or actcity maps)but the rooftops and no ground is completely fresh. 

  The lighting is good. But it's the rooftops alone that put the zing in the way 

  this map looks. </font>

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  This is a fun map to play, DM or teamplay. The narrow ledges don't give you 

  much space to jump around or strafe out of the way, so if you run into someone, 

  you better have quick reflexes and killer aiming. Grenades are really good here 

  against snipers, or anyone else for that matter. I presume snipers would snipe 

  from small areas where no one can see them, so grenades are really usefull there. 

  And against melee weapon users, this is a good surprise weapon if you don't 

  overtoss it, and throw it off the roof. Let's say you see an enemy on a ledge. 

  Toss a grenade and if it lands on the ledge, 1 of 2 things will happen. Either 

  he will be so surprised and stunned, that he will run off the edge while trying 

  to escape, or 2 - he will be extra careful (which means slow) in not falling 

  off, in which case the grenade will blow him sky high. </font>

  The overall mood of this map is suspense. Anything can happen at any moment

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Ever want to jump from rooftop to rooftop while being chased? Here is your chance, 

  thanks to CryptR. Great layout on this map, makings use of rooftop access. Players 

  do have access to hallways and rooms through doors on the rooftops. The layout 

  is not complex, and eventually you can work yourself back to where up started 

  from. There is also access to the backside of the buildings which are only useful 

  when transiting to the next building, very rarely did we have any exchange with 

  the enemy here. The layout does provide for a continuous exchange of gunfire. 

  One must be aware of where they are at all times, even when holed up in a building 

  standing by a nearby window. </font>

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> 6/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  There do seem to be some new textures used on different portions of actcity3. 

  There is a nice wood texture, along with some stone columns located on a balcony. 

  There is also a nice variety of textures used on the buildings. It does look 

  as if the background and sky were not completely finished. The sky is your standard 

  blue, with a layer of white clouds. The background also includes a mountain 

  setting and a cityscpe dotted with lighting. Its works for the map, but there 

  are a few barren spots between the mountains and the cityscapes. I also noticed 

  when standing at one end of the map, I am unable to see all the details, such 

  as the 'Cult Cola' sign at the far end of the map. Does this mean I can or cannot 

  see my opponant if sniping from this area? Never had this opprotunity to test 

  this theory. </font>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  This feels like a very large map for teamplay, just because of how it is laid 

  out. But it plays very smoothly, even for large games. I never felt cramped, 

  like I have on other city maps. This map does give your the opportunity to hole 

  up and look over a situation. There are many places for teams to secure, to 

  provide cover fire for other team members.There was also a steady exchange of 

  gunfire during our games. There was not really one area which had a majority 

  of the kills. They seemed to be spread out over the entire map. Even when the 

  action came down to one on one, the gameplay seemed to go rather quickly. DM 

  was not played on this map. </font>

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> 5/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Not much in the way of sounds. I did hear what sounded like the hum of an air 

  conditioning unit in one of the hallways I was running down. LIke most maps, 

  this one could have used some more sounds to help with the overall ambience 

  of the rooftop setting. Most all of the rooms and hallways are well lit, so 

  as not to give a hiding sniper any advantage. Outside, it feels like a gray, 

  overcast day, although that is not what the sky reflects. There are not really 

  any shadows anywhere, but that does not detract from rooftop setting. </font>

<p><b>Other:</b><br>

  Here is a new twist with an old theme. Not your typical city layout, but instead 

  of having street access, it is solely rooftop and room access via hallways. 

  If you fall off the bulding, you die. I do believe is the first map of its kind 

  available, where you do not have street access. This makes for some great rooftop 

  action. There are also a few details, such as the windowshades which open when 

  you click on them. There are also a few balconies with sliding doors you can 

  shoot from. There is also an open window at one end, which porvides great cover 

  for a sniper. Of course you may need a second team member watching your back 

  while sniping.There are also narrow walkways connecting the different buildings. 

  One must be cautious when crossing these narrow walkways or you can fall to 

  your death. These walkways are also in the open and provide no cover when running 

  on them, be careful not to take a bullet. </font>

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  This maps is nothing like its predecessors, nothing in actcity3 has been carried 

  over from either of the first two actcity maps. After having little change from 

  previous two, the concept here is excellent. You do get the feel of height when 

  running across the walkways. The change of height on the buildings makes for 

  much ladder climbing, which can slow you down and make you an easy target. Most 

  of the games I experienced were played outside, as opposed to indoors, which 

  seemed to be more for changing locations the actually attacking the enemy. I 

  do wish we had a street on the lower portion of the map, instead of just blackness.

  ITs great...its also an original. unlike all these other city maps it has sumthin 

  different to offer acq2 players. Some of the walkways could hav been a little 

  wider as to allow 2 ppl to pass each other on them with out both hurtilin to 

  their deaths. Unother problem is the scale. This is hard to get rite (fuk i 

  no from many bad maps b4) but all the doors are way to big...just like in actcity2(one 

  of da best maps eva). This map has very few dead ends which makes it cool. </font>

  Looks great. Again it has a different look to all the other city maps around...and

  Great fun in both dm and tp..breaks away from actcity1/2 idea which is a both

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The rooftop layout is COMPLETELY original, and I like it! It stops the run n' 

  gunners from ruling this map, and leaves some time for the more strategic elements 

  of teamplay. The lack of dark rooms is also a good thing, limiting the amount 

  of kills the campers will accumulate. My only reasons for the 2 point deductions 

  are that there are only 1 or 2 ways to cut across the gap, and so, any fans 

  of the automatic (less acurate at a distance) weapons are left at a little on 

  the screwed side. Also, the overall length of the maps can screw with snipers, 

  having people pop in and out of view can cause havok to a person's game. </font>

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> 10/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  GREAT look. I guess there COULD have been a floor or street for you to hit at 

  the bottom of the buildings, but that's an unsubstantial loss at best. Other 

  than that, it LOOKS like a rooftop! (I'll admit, the catwalk isn't set up to 

  walk you between buildings over such a distance without a railing.... but.... 

  once again, and unsubstantial loss). This map just looks great! </font>

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 10/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  A guaranteed good time. No matter what you prefer, DM, or teamplay, there's 

  plenty of ways to die (and kill) in this map, and the weapons are placed just 

  right, making sure you don't have EVERYONE with a sniper rifle, but on the other 

  hand, you can still find one of every weapon without having to try death defying 

  feats (eg, bxtrain2 and the M4!) </font>

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Well.... what can I say...... there's NO sounds included in this map that I've 

  noticed that help enhance the fact your on a roof..... A wind or street sound 

  with honking horns would have been nice to enhance the experience. Other than 

  that though, it carries through just fine. </font>

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  Overall, this is a great map, weather you prefer cramped maps, or empty maps, 

  DM or Teamplay... you're bound to come back to this map once or twice. Just 

  jumpkicking poor fools off the ledges is enough to keep me coming back ;) See 

  you on the field. </font>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Damn, can you say original? The whole idea of this map doesn't seem inspired 

  from any other map found in the vast Action Quake2 map pool. While still based 

  on a city concept, the architecture is unique and something special to see. 

  Other maps were close to ground level, others tried to implement highrises, 

  but this map truly does it awesomely. </font>

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The lighting is what this map is all about. Period. It adds the whole atmosphere 

  and feel to the level. The continuously dimming light when you look down below 

  and into the darkness of the streets below really confirms that CryptR KNOWS 

  how to do highrise maps. If you think you've seen all kind of highrise maps, 

  wait untill you try this one... It just looks awesome. </font>

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 6/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Unfortunately...the gameplay isin't as good. This map is a bit too much like 

  playing hide and seek. The spawns are professionaly placed, of course, but playing 

  this map just isin't as fun as the equivilent on the ground below. You always 

  seem to bump into an obstacle or a ledge as you're fighting against someone. 

  So you're continuously bothered by the design of the map which makes it very 

  awkward to play. </font>

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  As noted above, the lighting really adds to the ambiance of this map. Unfortunately...the 

  lighting is the only thing that adds to the ambiance. Where's the sound? I agree 

  there's a bit of sound placed randomly around the map, but it's still lagging 

  a bit in ambiance. I agree that it's pretty awesome the way it is, but there's 

  room for improvement. </font>

  This map goes to show that mappers aren't out of original concepts yet. </font>

  I love this idea! The battle on the rooftops is awsome, and caters to the players 

  with not only shooting, but also movement skills. One false move and your doing 

  the swan dive off the edge. One problem I have with the layout is the length 

  of the map. In some cases clipping occurs at long distances, obscuring the view 

  for snipers and targets there of. The placement of the wepons and amo in DM 

  are great. The sniper rifle and its amo are located on oppasite ends of the 

  map, limiting the kills those snipers can get without moving around to six or 

  less. I think the overall access to sniping positions and placement of amo more 

  than make up for the clipping issue. </font>

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> 9/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  I like the choice of textures used in this level. The simplicity of colors and 

  lighting effects are great. Theres no running right past your buddy hidding 

  in a corner because he looks like the wall in this level. I'm getting tired 

  of maps that have dark corners and entire rooms where you can't see a damn thing. 

  The lack of dark corners and rooms is great. Players who sit in dark corners 

  waiting for the unlucky opponent to wander by wont be getting the game winning 

  shot in this map. </font>

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 9/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Lots of fun to play, both DM and Teamplay. While effective, snipers are also 

  exposed to the good old handcannon and slippers trick. The variety of rooms 

  makes for varied play in both DM and Teamplay. Falling off the edge of a building 

  sucks, but it makes for more complicated/balanced gameplay, removing the luck 

  factor usually found in 'run at em firing' maps. </font>

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> 10/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The level has great flow, due mostly to its circular construction.(By circular 

  I mean you can go through the whole level along only one or two paths, and end 

  up where you started)The lighting is great. Not too dark, not too light, just 

  perfect for zooming in on someone's head and sending them flying off the catwalk. 

  </font>

<p><b>Other:</b><br>

  While testing the map I found the layout lends itself even to 2 player DM, the 

  flow of the level providing lots of chances for the two opponents to meet. </font>

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  Attention to detail, good lighting and overall design make this map one of my 

  top ten. This map has great flow, allowing even two or three people to play 

  DM without problems. </font>
