        </font></font>First off..Suislide and crew..you guys are really puttin 

        in great work dudes...Your mod is the bomb and I cant wait to see what 

        goes down with AHL... Secondly...police map is OK..but the shoot out always 

        comes down to the door at the end of the long hallway...??? and there 

        are really very little sniping opportunities...thats kinda cool cuz I 

        suck at sniping but for those that excel as a sniper.....?????Also no 

        back sneak attack route?? You know sneaking up from behind..... stay cool 

        and be eazy <br>

        </font>This level is very good, but it is missing one vital element that 

        would make it great: it needs an additional hallway so that there is a 

        back way around the station. Otherwise this map has one hallway which 

        is the kill zone and that's about all that ends up happening. I played 

        it on TP with 10 people or so and admit I had fun getting someone to open 

        the door at the end of the hallway and then openeing fire and taking out 

        about 3 people with my M4, but the fact that there is just that one hallway 

        makes it tiresome after a while. Sizewise the level is perfect, with the 

        exception of the aforementioned hallway, and this level shows great promise. 

        Just add the damn hallway!! Graphics: 8 Design: 7 Gameplay: 8 Framerates: 

        10 BTW, did I mention you need to add another hallway?<br>

  <b>Review:</b><br>

  Ok, this is my first review... so here it goes, I helped Spectacle test this 

  map, man, it was a blast with just 3 players, it can get pretty chaotic in some 

  areas, its structure was really good (has some surprises) and for some reason, 

  it took Spectacle a while to find the M4 (i found it right away :) The design 

  was really good, sorta looks like there was a small riot or something similar 

  to that (few borken things, blood on walls, etc etc), the weapons placement 

  was pretty good, except I couldn't find the Sniper Rifle anywhere, even though 

  there was a box of Sniper Rounds in the cell room... the framerates stayed pretty 

  smooth on my ATI 3D Rage Pro card (i know :P) so if i get smooth framerates, 

  then that means all you people with real OpenGL cards will have no trouble at 

  all. It looked pretty realistic to me (never been in a police hq though). Overall 

  for this map is 2 thumbs up for this map, I recommend only servers with a max 

  of 12 players to use this, if it goes higher then it may get a bit too crowded, 

  especially if it has ATL, so here comes the ratings..... Structure: 9 Design: 

  9 1/2 Weapons: 9 Gameplay: 10 Framerates: 10 Look: 8 1/2 Overall: 9 1/2 <br>

  I just wanna say a few things about this map. are slagdaddy and ruskprick the 

  same person? and is this really a new map or just part of teacher that i didnt 

  see? this could be fun if you play Cops vs. Thugs (please use mr kill's skins 

  and not the gay ass aq2 ones) Who am i to decide but this one should be like 

  the duke3d police station (in the atomic edition) Come on there is one jail 

  cell here! and what in the hell is with the spikes on the door? i really dont 

  understand this map. That radio playing the john tesh-like music should DIE! 

  if youre gonna put annoying music in your level (I.E. Asylum) then make it so 

  the players can turn it off! Oh well thats all from me now ill give it a 5/10 

  (hehe i just noticed the thing on the submit reveiw page that says use correct 

  english and complete sentences. me feil englush? that unpossibel!)<br>

  </b> This map is based on a police station, which some elements of the map show 

  this. The textures on the map are a combination of realistic and cartoony. The 

  grates, boombox, doors, book shelves, and doggy wheez treat dispenser are cartoony 

  to say the least. Some maps pull of realistic and cartoony combo's pretty well, 

  this however is not one of those maps. Aside from textures not mixing well, 

  but well enough to be decent, the architecture is well done. There are some 

  nice places to get into fights for some cool demo's or whatnot have you. One 

  is by the flipped table that stands as a barrier on the lower of the three level 

  building by the hall and stairs going up a floor. Another place is in the hall 

  with the Crates stacked in the cubby hole area, on the third floor i believe 

  it was. It's a good map overall nothing mindblowing, some things werent so enjoyable 

  like dying from the three spikes in the doorway that kill you in 2-3 seconds 

  if you don't move. The music from the boombox was more than aggravating though, 

  he should stick the pimp car music from Subway in there. And one more thing 

  which could have lead to at least another great map made in action history, 

  the ducts above, you see them you want to crawl in them and come out and pop 

  some people, but alas you cannot get in them. One area has one little duct area 

  that is accessible for what could be approx. 50 Quake feet worth of ducting 

  that was accessable. to go in crawl around a corner and fall out the bottom 

  and into a hall which you would more than likely get massacred in if there is 

  more than 2 people in coming through. Scores in my book rank up: Framage: 10/10 

  : no big areas to slow play down, not too small though. on P2 300 64meg ram 

  no 3d card, software mode. Texture & Lighting: 7/10 : The cartoony textures 

  didn't mix well, either all one or mixing better would have salvaged this. Weapons 

  & ammo placement: 8/10 : Quite a bit ways of run to get to one or the other, 

  that could be a good thing too. Some weapons appear where they should end up 

  being a police station. Gameplay: 9/10 : I didn't play against anyone but im 

  going to give this map the benefit of the doubt since it had some good looking 

  fight areas Overall: 8.5/10 : Average it up and whoop. There ya go the whole 

  shibang goes into a B map category. <br>
