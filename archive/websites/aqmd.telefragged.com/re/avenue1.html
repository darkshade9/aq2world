    Hi all out there once more! LTS.PooP is back with another review. First off 
    this map has Death Match written all over it! It is too huge for teamplay 
    but, I consider, the best map for DM. Some textures i notices were ripped 
    from some maps I've played on before (ie. urban). This map has it all. Unlike 
    MidtownX, no retarted textures, the size is big. I recomment 18 players on 
    this map or DM. Try it out for teampaly but I don't think it will pull out 
    a winner for teamplay. The structure and design is excellent. The weapons 
    placement is very tasty! You can find what you need in some kewl spots (ie. 
    trunk of limmo)! The gameplay is fun because people just keep on poping from 
    different areas. The framerates are really nice on my 4MB 3D card. It looks 
    pretty kewl, though i wish people would stop using that sky texture. In my 
    opinion is isn't too good. It is gloomy. It has some great open spots and 
    I always find something new! The overall grade i give it is an A-. This should 
    be a big hit for the DM maps, since the few maps that have come out in the 
    past aren't too exciting. <br>

    I had seent eh sentence going something like "If you thought Blockwar and 
    school were big then you'll be surprised" Well I am not that surprised, maybe 
    at the detail but not at the (large but not INCREDIBLE) size The map seems 
    to be teamplay and certainly DM friendly and the weapons are very nicely placed, 
    Lighting was well used but I feel that the orange and purple as is realisticwas 
    used too much making it look a little multicoloured. Actual detail/design/making 
    of brushes is excellent, some details are more than cool, like you can hide 
    in the trunk of the shotgun car in wait for the next foolish child that runs 
    up in glee to the closed boot and opens it, only to find - BANG!! he didn't 
    have time to blink. and the other things...yep I would say this map is a mix 
    of Subway (duh), Blockwar and midtown but not Urban, my favourite map. It 
    is not sniper friendly but my MP5/Laser could do some serious damage. Well 
    done TTI for another excellent map. I say a good 8/10 <br>
