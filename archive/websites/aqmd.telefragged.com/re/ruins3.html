<b>Review:</b><br>

Well, Runitai has done it again… he has created the best simulated combat town I've ever seen… and as an x-army type, I've seen quite a few real ones to know what's good and what's not. Not two weeks from his ruins2 map posting, which was a great improvement over his original ruins1,  Runitai has created a true masterpiece this time… not without a few flaws, but a masterpiece none the less…Bravo! 

<p>

Layout: *****<br>

Based on a semetrical city map, its about 9 square city blocks in size. There are four, 3-4 story buildings on each of the four corners of the map, with plenty of sniper ports overlooking the middle blocks. The middle of the map contains two, 1&2 story buildings, one rubble building, and a nice maze of streets strewn with rubble (read: cover!). All but one of the buildings have roof top access. There is a sewer system with 2 access points and 3 exits. Interior layout of the buildings are tight rooms that are non-semetric, which gives many of tactical possibilities and is guaranteed to confuse new players for the first few times through. 

<p>

Weapons & Ammo: *****<br>

2 Sniper Rifles, 2 MP5's, 2 Shotguns, 1 R4 and 1 Sawed-off guarantee a firepower packed map. Ammo spawn points include 4 boxes of sniper ammo, 9 MP5 mags, 6 boxes of 00-Buck, 2 R4 mags, 5 pistol mags, and 4 grenade points. This is a good mix of hardware, and is all well dispersed across the map, with correct ammo close enough to all corresponding weapons. Random spawns of all the other gear is good, with plenty of ammo vests popping up all over the place (The R4 guys need these!).

<p>

Gameplay: *****<br>

This is an ideal map for teamplay and makes a darn good map for a general frag fest as well. Since there are eight heavy hitter weapons available, that’s about the ideal number to keep this map running at a moderate pace for DM. You could, however, easily put 16 or so on this map for teamplay and never see the same guys twice, since most areas are isolated by either buildings or rubble. Movement in the open is the most dangerous game here, since there are no less then 15 windows and sniper ports overlooking the ground, plus 5 rooftops to contend with. Death will come quickly to anyone who doesn’t understand how to use cover, concealed movement, and in teamplay, covering fire. This might scare newbees into an attempted sniper war. Skilled players, however, will brave the deadly sniper fire to maneuver between buildings for the rewards and excitement that only close quarter battle can offer. Moving between most buildings via jumping from height is quite possible by skillful jumping with minimal damage. It is, in fact, the only way to get into one of the buildings. Runitai has done a masterful job of overcoming the shortcomings of the current fall damage setting of the Action Mod by excellent use of rubble and rooftop placement for landing areas. Interior room layout is tight & twisty; you could almost hide a platoon of men in either two of the higher buildings. Exterior lighting is set for dusk (or so I hear… se problems.. below), which would make it a little easier to cross the map without getting smacked with a sniper round. 

<p>

Mapping & Textures: ****<br>

I'm a player, a clan leader, and a  server admin… in that order. I don’t map, and I am in awe of anyone who can do it well. The most important part of a map to me as a player is a good layout with fast textures. This map does not disappoint. The layout is masterful… just perfect. The textures are perfect for this urban terrain setting, and look almost true to life. No attempt has been made to cheapen this map with objects that don’t lend well to the Quake II engine or the intended motif such as cars, interior fixtures, or Duke Nukem style street signs. A few burning barrels litter the street, but they are done well, and provide great cover and good wall valting.

<p>

Problems:<br>

All masterpieces have their flaws, and this one is no exception. 1) There are a few places that if you stand just right, you get see-through walls. Don't know why, but it would be nice if this was fixed. This doesn’t hurt gameplay though, since their locations are non-tactical. 2) My p200 had a bit of lagging problem when I'm on the ground in the rubble area… I think that if I had a P-II with a 100hmz bus, that wouldn’t be a problem though. 3) I got stuck in between two small rubble walls, near the sewer access, a few times and I've fragged a few that got stuck there as well. Hit the manhole cover head on and you'll be just fine. 4) Somehow, when I was on top of the 1st story building, I jumped to my death by hopping up and down while on the ledge… don’t do that. 5) I hesitate to disclose this, but it will become common knowledge soon anyway… certain Video tweak settings will remove all nighttime elements… rendering it daylight outside. I happened to have started out that way, not knowing that is was supposed to be dark outside… guess that’s why my sniper rifle is so feared on that map!   

<p>

Overall: **** 1/2<br>

This is a must have map. I rate it 4 1/2 out or 5 stars. Fix the bugs, and it would rate 5 stars. No Action server is complete without this map.

<b>Review:</b><br>

Ruins was great, Ruins2 was a bit of a dissapoinment for, but Ruins3 more then redeem Runati as a great map maker.

<p>

The main reason why I gripe about Ruins 2 is because the two sets building were too close toghther, thus elminating the sniper element in teamplay. Ruins 3 however has a nice middle field great for fire fight and for snipers to point there little scopes at.

<p>

The size of the level is great, esepecially for team play. Once again Runati gives a great sense of Urban warfare here as the decayed city makes a great backdrop. Although set at nite (which doesn't look right, ruins looks cooler in that sort of dusk time light) it's well lit so there aren't any hiding bastards.

<p>

The diversity in space is great, letting all types of players use their favorite weapons to the full extent. Once again the buildins have little to no cover, making for some intense, twitch fire fights. Meanwhile there are enough little secret entrances (like the sewer) and cover areas to allow for the intelligent player to flew his brain muscles.

<p>

Overall Ruins3 is a great map. Runati once again captures the feel of an idea while not sacraficing gameplay. Great work!

<b>Review:</b><br>

Damn. This map is such an improvement over ruins1,and 2. I absolutely loved it. There are SOOOO many places to go (as opposed to the fairly small ruins1/2), and the barrels with the wood and lava in it are nice touches. There is a fairly hard to get to sniper rifle, and there is a convenient crack in a boarded wall that gives you a view of the entire map, right next to it. And the ammo spawns right there. If your a sniper, look for maps that run this. As always, the m4 is hard to find if you don't know where to look. You can get to it from the sewers. I loved playing on this map, and I give it a 10/10.
