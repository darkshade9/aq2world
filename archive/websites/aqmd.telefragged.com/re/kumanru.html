<b>Review:</b><br>

The first thing that I noticed about this map was its unique feel. The textures are done perfectly for the theme of the level. They give this map a great sense of individuality. The author achieves this nicely.

<p>

Kumanru has many areas, including a sewer, an altar, an outdoor area, and the sniper towers. In this map, its very hard to stay in the same place for a long period of time, which i liked. Example, if your in the sniper tower by the swinging bells, an enemy can shoot you from the ground, from the bridge behind you, and from a hill they can climb up to get a quick snipe. Most places in this map are like this, which i like. It minimizes camping, which is a thing I hate (camping that is, not minimizing it :)

<p>

The lighting is also done very well. The shadows cast make great hiding spots, especially with the KGB skin. However, the shadows are not overdone, or underdone, there is a nice balance.

<p>Weapons placement is also another strong point. Example, the M4 is placed in a room, on the altar, and you can snipe the person going for it from different places. I like that, because i feel that the weapons that are better should be harder to get, because you can get ambush from any side.

<p>

Kumanru is a great map, with minimal flaws, and maximum fun, a must have !!

<b>Review:</b><br>

What lies within the walls of the ancient temple that attracts all of these adventurers and explorers? Will it be found and brought back to civilization, or will it remain lost as everyone dies in a series of betrayals and treachery?

<p>

Right out of the 'zip' this map is beautiful. The textures are effective, the lighting is excellent, and the layout is fantastic, giving the impression that you are in a huge structure of some sort of ancient Central or South American vintage.

<p>

Stylistically, this map is wonderful. It looks great and it feels right. The bells on the bridge are an inspired touch. The down side is that this map isn't that great if you're not into more or less "standard" Quake2 playing. The map is completely interconnected, and you are able to run pretty much smoothly all over the map. This is great for a standard Quake2 game, where "dogfights" are the norm. 

<p>

For AQ2 it just doesn't seem to sit right. Lacking lots of good dead ends, the knife and the handcannon are more or less useless, and the sniper rifle is of only limited effectiveness. Expect to see alot of folks running through the map firing wildly with pistols, and expect to see the M4 in use early and often.

<p>

This is a map intended for rowdy, non-stop frag-a-second pure deathmatch play. If you're the type who likes to stalk your prey, or play tactically, you should probably pass this one up.

<b>Review:</b><br>



First of this is a great map.  The strategic placing of ledges in the courtyard area outside provides for some fun long ranged firing from elevated postions, and at the same time a great challenge trying to hit those lil bastards hitting at you from up there.

<p>

The design of the bell room is very original and entertaining.  The positioning of the sniper rifle in the room above provides for some poetential to sneak up on whoever is up there.  And the swinging bells, creates a sort of random chance hit if the sniper turns around and insues a distanced skirmish across the narow pass to the room.

<p>

And the room leading off to two other places creates for even more oppurtunities for someone to come up and catch someone in on a nasty crossfire. 

<p>

I also admire the way the 12 gauge was positioned.  The devestating things that can break out just trying to get into that little hidden room are a whole side track issue in its own, "although it seems most people don't know where its at."

<p>

Also there was a gorgous texture design thrown together making this pretty much my top pick of a level giving it a creative originality feel to it that makes it enjoyable to play regular action and especially teamplay.  Play it today :)
