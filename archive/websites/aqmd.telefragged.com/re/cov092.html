<b>Review:</b><br>

This review is way overdue, no one else would do one so i figured i would :) the map is sheer brilliance, it's what action is all about, great weapon/ammo placement (although the m4 is a little easy to get, it shouldnt be a problem once the m4 has been balanced out), lots of places to hide/snipe, runs fine - even on my p166, the map also has very realistic settings and lighting to add to the map, this is the kind of map i'd like to see more of, i'm not really fond of 'dm style maps' that are for rockets rather than action and strategy. anyway, this is a map i feel should be somewhere on the rotation of every server, it's simply one of those maps you wan't to play again and again, i recommend this map highly, though you don't have to download it because it comes with Action Quake2 v.95.

<b>Review:</b><br>

At first glance, this restaurant map is something of an eyesore. The textures leave much to be desired, although Teeq should be commended for actually trying to update the library of Q2 textures with some more realistic modern-day stuff. Since I've worked on making textures since the days of Wolfenstein, I can really understand and sympathize with the thankless task he attempted.

<p>

However, the map is immediately recognizable as a restaurant, in the vein of a Denny's or more of Friday's or Friendly's, but with a "down home" earthy feel. A humorous and ironic setting, and one that is perfect for AQ2. His heavy use of orange is absolutely perfect and really adds to the ambience.

<p>

From a player's perspective this map is almost perfect. The flow is excellent, there's enough space, room and interconnectivity to run around and fight, and yet enough "sidelines" to make the map interesting. There are closets to hide in, bars to duck behind, even a dishwasher to "explore" :) The map flows without becoming a "waterfall" where all of the players collect at the lowest point and fight with their pistols.

<p>

The sniper rifle becomes less effective as there are actually spawn points in close proximity to most of the good sniping spots. In fact, the spawn points are the worst part of this map. One spawn point (in the dining room by the kitchen with the MP5) is in the center of the floor in a high traffic area. Once I was running around with the shotgun and a number of kills and someone respawned and killed me _as I was walking across the floor_. Basically, a good deal more thought could have been put into the spawn points throughout the level.

<p>

Other than that, this map makes an excellent high-speed frag-a-thon pure deathmatch map, and it's also good for stalking. Without many doors, and with all of the hallways leading to 2 or 3 more hallways, it's a little weak in the tactical playing department. All of the weapons are useful on this level, although the sniper rifle a little less so (although a skilled sniper with the rifle and a silencer on the roof of the cinema can kick some serious ass).

<b>Review:</b><br>





This was the first map I ever play in Action Quake II, and this was also the map that made me continue my online Quake II gaming. This map has stunning outdoor scenes, as well as variated indoor scenes. I like the idea of the roof, that is dark and filled with boxes for cover. On the top of the roof there are also some great sniper spots, and that gives the map potential for being a lot of players favourite. Even though this map gives a lot of nice sniper spots, a good player with a shotgun should have no problem taking him down.
