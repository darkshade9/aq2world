<b>Review:</b><br>

Dang nabit! It's getting hard to do a review on a virgin map. Hehe. Well, this one needs one good. So I will start on the basics. This is a HUGE map to me. I mean, I've played this comfortably with 10 people, and that still left me so when I respawned, I lived a good 5 or 6 seconds. The prison has EVERYTHING. My fave part has to be the nice sniper towers overlooking the courtyard, Don't stand on top of them, but get underneath and crouch and most people pass you by. Yea, you say you hate snipers. Well, too bad. Stick to the cell-type things. Good gun battles happen there, even though usually my wonderful dial-up hits me with the L word here. DOH! There is so much to this level, I really am at a loss for words... Plus, everyone should have this level anyway! I mean, it is one of the originals! So go get it and stop whining you don't!
