<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>I really liked this map. It is especially good for teamplay, due to it's layout, forcing you to go forward and fight. I really like the bases with the gates and stuff. This is like my favorite teamplay map, because of it's layout. It moves you mentally to go forward and fight head on, insetead of camp. I can tell you, this is NOT a camper's paradise.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>I LOVE THIS MAP!! It is fun when you sit behind the big gun battery with a sniper rifle and when your enemy comes right where the shell hits, you fire and they fly 50 feet. And the airstrikes! They scare the hell out of you when you see a 20 foot long missle flying at your head. The mines. What can I say? PURE GENIUS. It is funny when you shoot your opponent as they jump over the mines, get hit back, and blow up. PURE EXPLOSIVE FAMILY FUN.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>This is where the map lacks somewhat. There aren't a whole lot of sounds that make it feel like a battlefield. Maybe it would be better if there was like gunfire sounds or people dying in the distance sounds or something. But too bad there aren't. This brings it down a bit, but this map still KICKS!!</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>I really liked it. The gun and airstrikes make this map fun. I love blowing my friends up with the gun. It really kicks when the map is integrated with USEFUL objects. Like in Beach Assault, with the machine guns and the chopper (I LOVE THAT DAMN THING!! except when it drops me, 50 feet in the air :(</FONT><P>

<b>Review:</b><br>
 If there ever was a map that encouraged teamplay, well, Desert is it. Before I came upon this concotion of air strikes, artillery, and very nice ammo depots, I was like, "team? what is that?" Even though AQ2 isn't teamplay yet (I can't wait, my modem is just itching to download that puppy) I feel as though this map is close enough for now. Two bases. Sound familar you TF fans? (Rock1 all the way! Go Sgt. Thundercock, we love ya!) (Unless your a Q1 junkie as well as a Q2 one, ignore that) Between the two bases lies but the funniest thing I have ever seen. (And I almost forgot about it) A minefield. There is nothing more gratifying then watching some guy charge at you, then suddenly disippear in a cloud of fire and shrapnel. It's so damned funny. Then, if you manage to survive the onslaught of underground terror, you have to worry about incoming from the artillery positions next to each base. Gotta love those nice quad-grenades they fire at the push of a button! Inside each base, if you manage to get there, is the following: Two (2) sniper towers..hehe, read my earlier review on hostage to see my view on snipers. One (1) Room shit (whoops) full of weapons. A lot of weapons. And ammo too. All I ever wanted for Christmas was that room. Hell, I'll give up 20 Christmas' for that room. One (1) Barracks. Nice for sleeping...or whatever else beds are good for. One (1) Fire control center...a room with a desk and a computer...see next. AND FINALLY, the COOLEST feature of this map. One (1) SatLink/Bomber command/whatever you like to call it Airstrike place. It is simple. You hit the button in the trailer, then go hit the computer. And a nice bomber comes and bombs the other base. Too bad you only get one. (Whoever designed this lev-rerelease a version with this thing set for UNLIMITED!!!!) Anyway, enough of my rambling. Play this map or I will kick your ass! <br>

<b>Review:</b><br>
Okay, teamplay is out, and everyone wanted to see how this one would play with it. It has its ups and its downs.
<p>But first, for those who've never seen this map before: there are two bases, seperated by a "mountain pass" style bottleneck. Each base is almost exactly the same (the distances between the buildings are just a tiny bit different in one than the other). In the center of the pass, there are barricades and a mine field that can be very deadly. Each base has an airstrike commlink and a howitzer.
<p>First of all, your own howitzers _can kill your teammates_. It happened to me twice today, and I'm sick of people telling me, "the howitzers don't hurt teammates, you can't kill your teammates!" The howitzers are _map effects_ people, they are not weapons like the handcannon or M4.
<p>
As far as teamplay goes, this map is quite good. Your options are limited (either get an MP5 or M4 and charge the enemy base, get a shotgun and provide close support, or get a sniper rifle and defend the base or provide support to your "grunts" with it). Watching the combat on a crowded server from a distance (while sniping, for example) is a load of fun.
<p>
Fans of war movies should rejoice, as they can say their favorite quotes while engaging in combat on the front lines. "You apes wanna live forever?" If you've ever seen "Saving Private Ryan" then you'll enjoy the sniper towers.
<p>
All in all, a great map for that WWII feel, but it can get tired really, really fast.<br>
