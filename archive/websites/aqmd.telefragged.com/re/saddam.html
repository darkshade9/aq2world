<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>Nice, need I say more! I enjoyed exploring this map ofline. It's well set out with tubes and a corridors and a very snazzy rocket/missile. It also has a cool moving conveyer belt with chemicals in 'em, very ironic! </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>It looks great. The textures are well chosen and alined. There is very cool banner of Saddam himself which I enjoyed taking a couple of shots at. The missile looks good and the whole map is well lit. I specifically the tubes which had blues light in them c'est tres chic!</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>When saddam was made they had to have been thinking of playing DM only and having about 25-30 people. This map is huge, one of the biggest maps i've played on. This is idealy for DM although I havent yet played it on DM I played it on TP and wow each round took about 3 minutes and Me and just about everyone else were in the negatives. There are many hazards and traps that your enemy can get you in, so watch out when you play this one.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>This map is pretty good as for looks yet it reminds me of playing regular quake and that just isnt my thing. But the rocket does look pretty nice.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Rating:</B> 5/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>I had to give this one a low score. It was probally just becuase everyone had killed themselves more than other people and that it took me about 3 minutes just to find someone.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 7/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>This is definately a rush or wait about 10 minutes to find someone to come walking along. So campers and snipers beware unless you like a good wait(but honestly...who does???).</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>This map is full of tricks and traps so if you like that kind of thing then you'll probally like this map =-).</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>All I can really say about this map is that if you wanna play with some friends you better bring a party or you will be there for a while =-). P.S. make sure the server has a time limit.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>Out of most maps I've seen this map has a great deal of thought behind it, although I would have liked to have seen some deviation from the usual three ways to get someplace (hallways, windtunnel, conveyor belts.) It makes camping rather easy, but it does keep the matches shorter than they would be.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>Beautiful work here, I think the layout compliments textures and and likewise with the prefabs. Each section has its own feel and mood to it which is very nice to see.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>This was a strange occurance, sometimes this map can be very fun while other times if people continue along the same lines of attack and retreat then it gets very dull. I found playing CTB to be boring as hell if i happened to be playing with morons. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 10/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>This map is goofy as all hell. And it feels and plays that way. I thought the lava trap was the most amusing thing i've seen in a map in a long time. Seeing a teamate fry another teamate and exclaim &quot;oh shit i'm sorry man.&quot; That is classic.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>I would have liked to have seen more cover areas that would be good for hand cannon use and some real sniper spots but other than that it was fine.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>I gave this map high marks, but in all honesty I'm not going to a server right away if i see it being played. There are other maps that I'd rather be playing than this even though its pretty damn good.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>Well I must way I was really impressed with the Layout of this map, and some of the major objects, such as that nice big nuke, were amazingly lifelike.<br>Not to many good skirmish areas in this one though, obviously Rusk decided it was time to create a map that really caters to the snipers.<br></FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>AS I said above, the level looks great. Texture use is excellent, and r-speeds are kept well down, but it all seems to be at the expense of good gameplay.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Rating:</B> 3/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>To Open. To Big. Any less than 8 a side on teamplay and this map gets real boring, real fast. Anytime someone decides to camp, or snipe without moving, it can get to be a really drawn out affair.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>Good mood, created by good architecture. But somhow it is destryoed by the lack of sound in most areas, and the lack of people to shot at half the time.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>Great layout idea for a map, all the twists and turns and tunnel ways. The many secrets you can find around here are amasing, how could you not like the layout.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Looks Rating:</B> 10/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>Great map, his little throw in of "The King of Traps" is great for everything in the map. Good uses of textures and the rocket could have a little more of an effect.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Gameplay Rating:</B> 10/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>CTB, Gangsters, Escort, theyll all work with this map, even teamplay and DM are good. Escort and Gangsters work good with "Assassinate Saddam" type scenarios.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>RuskPrick has done it again for the entire Action Quake mapping world, and the Action: Espionage world. There is so much to do, so many secrets and so many tricks. I also notice a lot of people hang around the lava room and burn their own teammates ;-)</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>Hey boys and girls! Rookie here again telling it how it is!
<P>
Well, to say I'm not a Ruskprick fan is an outright lie. He is probably one of the best mappers out there but there is no denying that but Saddam, well, isn't quite up to "par."
<P>
The layout for Saddam is decent enough but glaring errors exsists. One is the openess of the map. There is WAY too much open space. If there was more cover it'd be great. Also the map really caters to CTB rather then DM or even TP, the map is just too BIG for any other kind of game. However this is an AMAZING CTB map. With all the keen traps and multiple routes from each side of the stage Saddam is an enjoyable CTB level.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Looks Rating:</B> 10/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>The return of Ruskpricks gourgeous high colour textures is back into full effect. The map looks absolutely stunning! The attention to detail is quite amazing from the Iraq flags on the crates to the pipes in the walls. Just by looking at it you know it's a Ruskprick level. </FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Gameplay Rating:</B> 5/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>This is where Saddam dies. On a gameplay level Saddam in nowhere near as fun as City, Teacher or CTBcity. It seems Ruskprick put too much attention into the "traps" rather then making a design that would accomadate flawless gameplay. The result? You spend the fist few minutes goofing around with the traps till you realzie, no one falls for them. </FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 10/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>Once again, this look, sounds, feel of this level just seems like I'm running through an Iraqi missle silo, alebeit an possible parody of an Iraqi missle silo. The industrial conveyor belts, the crates, the cold metallic look of the halls add to the ambiance which can only be described as "stunning."</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Other Comments:</B><BR></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>While beautiful Saddam is a beautiful map is falls into the "all flash no substance" area. Once you have foon ooing and aweing you realize this is a pretty static map. "Raise the bar" you say? Maybe not.</FONT><P>
