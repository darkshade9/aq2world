<b>Review:</b><br>

Well, this is definantly going to be a mixed review. Unfortunantly the bad outweighs the good this time. 

<p>

To start with the level takes place on the streets of a city. Most of the buildings are fairly unidentifyable, and all of the buildings are dark and dreary. 

 <p>

While the level is fun to play, it is definantly not a pretty sight. Cartoonish textures are everywhere, they look like they've been ripped out of Duke3d or blood, or any other of the build engine games.  Now as this map clearly demonstrates Quake2 + Cartoon textures + Dark atmosphere = Ugliest sight possible. Now perhaps if the level was more brightly lit, the textures would be a little more appropriate. Of course the Quake2 textures are also used, and they definantly do not mix with the custom textures used.

<p>Now if horrible textures weren't bad enough, this level does not get the point across. A city? Oh? This just looks like some rooms, ramps, crates, windows, arranged randomly along what's supposed to be a street.

<p>

It's fun, and it runs fast. But far too flawed to be considered good. 6/10 is about as generous as I can be with this one.

<b>Review:</b><br>

Ok, well after hearing Talon's review, I went into this map expecting a poorly done piece of crap. But, to my suprise, the map was great! The textures give a feel that you are in the run down part of town, you know as in, you live here, you might as well be homeless. The map offers great features for teamplay as well as dm, including but not limited to:  several hiding spots, several buildings to hold up in, many windows for you bastard snipers :) , and open streets for you go get those some bitches types. The textures in the map are not poorly used, in fact, without them, the map would be at fault, because it would be dull indeed. The ping times are great, and the map is a perfect size. Its not too big so you get lost looking for that last sap whos been hiding the whole game, but its not cramped at all. This map is a classic in my opinion, and I recommend it to anyone. I hope this can be included in mappack2, or 3. Another great map from Skull N. Bones.

<b>Review:</b><br>

After reading Talon's review, I kinda disagreed with him. Firstly, Talon sounds like he missed an entire section of the map. There are underground passages through the entire map, though getting into it is kind of obscure. This thing is really dark, really really dark, because its night. Talon didn't seem to notice the sky, which has stars in it. Duh? Last time I checked, night time is dark, bud! This is a pretty cool map, but not the greatest. Nothing really unique, I give it a 7/10.

<b>Review:</b><br>

This is my first review for all those map depot regulars like your self. Now in response to Talons review and Limbcutter I would have to say that Im leaning towards Limbcutters opinion, I thought the map was constructed nicely and that the textures where done well. The only thing I have against it is that it couldve been a bit more detailed as in labelling buildings and such. Now as a fledgling map maker as myself I am intrigued by these types of maps, citys and such, If I were to make a map i would make a REAL block in a suburban setting with about 10 different houses and a street in the center. Overall this map was worth my download time and worth the review I just wrote. I give this map a 8 out of 10. I do suggest you grab this map ;)

<b>Review:</b><br>

 I'm back already, folks, in case 'ya cared! Okay...Let's git it ON!

<br>

**Design**  --  5/10<br>



  For some reason, while I was playing this map, I kept thinking -- "What the HELL is this?!". The design is horrible. Skull, you should really think of adding a few more items in your rooms. Every room was boooooring. Nothing. Empty rooms.

  And the Library... SHEESH! Endless stack of books. How pointless. No one even bothers going in here, 'cept to grab the M4.

<p>

**Weapons**  --  8/10<br>



  Well, I guess it was okay. They weren't hidden, or placed in logical spots, just strewn on the floors in blank, boring, pointless rooms (see above...).

<p>

**Gameplay**  --  8/10<br>



  Ehhhh... It was okay fun, once you got past the horrible textures and pointless buildings. The library sucks... people hide and hide, and no one seems to be able to find them. It ends up being one person running around shooting, screaming, "COME AND GET ME!", with the others clutching their weapons poised in the library. Sheesh. 

  But, alas, lag is no problem...

<p>

**Overall**  --  6/10<br>



  Skull is a talented map-maker, no doubt. My only request is he spends a little more time play-testing and adding a little to the rooms. A sink here and there, or a nice table to duck under and bandage -- things such as this. Think about it, man...

  This map seemed rushed. That's it. Rushed. This could be easily solved with a bit of effort.

<p>

  Now, while I'm trying to help Skull out in any way i can, I really don't reccomend this map. It's fairly boring, and sure as hell ain't an architectural masterpiece... =P .

<p>

         I wish 'ya luck in the future, Skull! Keep pluggin' away though. With a few modifications, you could release an better version of this map, with a bit more realistic feel. Thanks!

<b>Review:</b><br>







 I've got a mixed review for this map as well. When I first got this map I wanted to put up a review right off. Then I decided to play it with some friends first. Unfortunately playing it gave me a very mixed feeling about the map.

<p>

I won't go into the design and textures and such in the map... because there is only one section I can go into. How fraggin dark it is. I know, it is night. But I have excellent night vision and can see fairly well with little light. But in this map, I can't see jack squat. Even at night will all the lights out in my room, and the brightness set to full, I can barely make out the fact that buildings are involved in the map. I have little to no idea what the design is like and I've rarely gotten to see a texture because it is so blasted dark. I have a feeling it is probably something to do with my video card, as my brother and I have the same card and neither of us could see a thing in the map. Also a friend of mine with a voodoo 2 could see both of us and constantly wondered why he could kill us while we stood there with no reaction to his presence other than to run aimlessly into the walls next to us.

<p>

I've never had a problem with any other map and darkness, but in this one I constantly get a headache as the bright lights on the ceilings shine down while my pupils constantly try to open to be able to see anything. If the map were a little lighter (and I could make anything out... I don't know maybe a building or a door or something would be nice) I might enjoy the map. But as it is, I fear that I will not play this map ever again.

<b>Review:</b><br>





Skull and Bones is one of my favorite map makers (Other notable works include Hostage and Quittin) and Midtown is no exception.

<p>

The layout is simple yet functional for both Teamplay and DM. On one side of the city is a lrage library, the other a warehouse of some sort. The two sides are linked by a road with a slum apartment in the middle, where a lot of fights begin =)

<p>

In DM this map is only good. The weapon layout it good, as with ammo but the it;s a little too big for DM, especially small DM games. Where the map really breaks through is teamplay. The areas are tight, distiguishable (a HUGE plus in teamplay, since you can say stuff like "enemy in the library") and multiple routes to attack yer opponent and suprise him with. The battles are fairly intense and a true sense of "urban combat" comes out of the map.

<p>

Gripes, well, i basically have none! This is a great map, download it now if you don't have it. I highly recomend it.

<b>Review:</b><br>

This is my first review but I felt that the previous reviews of this map did not do it justice. Specifically, I want to look at the map from a team play point of view. I guess the other reviewers were DM guys. This map has a pretty basic layout and when you first get on it, all the action seems to be directed down one alley connecting the two sides of the board. However, a little investigation reveals some alternative access points. How to find those I will leave to the reader, but the first time I found one and crawled up behind an enemy sniper with my silenced m5 was one of my greatest quake2 moments. The darkness of the map and some of the rooms allow all sorts of players, from handcannon guys with slippers to snipers. There are places on the board for every style of player. I definitely encourage team play guys to give this board a chance.
