Very good layout.... I have discovered many jumps that if done correctly... you could literally jump from one side of the map to the other and not take damage... the water is cool, cause you can do some mad jumps and still come out unscathed. the loop scheme is nice for TP cause you can box in the enemy. </FONT><P>

Bouncing around with a Cannon is so great... lame auto users will flock to the very top... and sit there pelting your teammate while you come up from behind and BOOM! BOOM !BOOM! blast them to the edges if the map... some ppl ask if i have a choke on my H.C. cause it is so mean. </FONT><P>

This is a superb map... and all you ppl saying the water makes it alme... well i disagree... any more water may have killed it... but as is, there is good amount... the respawn pouint in the lowest section is bad though.... my clan has flooded ppl who respawn in there... on guards the ladder (with a HC) and a few barrel down into the pond and reak havic! </FONT><P>

A small map with good vertical variance. Half the map is on high ground, half the map on low ground. Manuevering the cliffs can be tricky at first but after a while intermediate and advanced players will come up with clever ways of jumping from one place to another. There are numerous ways to get from one side of the map to another although not all are apparent the first few times you play this map. </FONT><P>

Fairly bright outdoor setting. A couple waterfalls to swim up or down but mostly just cliffs. Either side has a small building with a cable car that runs in between. </FONT><P>

This map is loads of fun. Automonkeys will be prevelant for sure but a shotgun (or hand cannon if you are a little daring) will do well also. This isn't the greatest sniping map but the layout doesn't stop the best snipers from making their presence felt. Grenade freaks (and you know who you are!) will have a blast as you can whip a grenade across the map in many places. No one is safe! Manuvering the cliffs, while tricky at first, can be fun when you understand the layout a little better. The action is often fast and furious. </FONT><P>

<b>Review:</b><br>

  All I can say is YIKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This map is amazing!! How did all of 

  this fit into 800k? First of all, the layout is great. It's basically a whole 

  bunch of cliffs now and there is still the cable car. Hard for me to describe 

  the layout cuz it's so vast. You've gotta play it for yourself. "Watch your 

  step" is what Ace has put in as the subtitle for the map when loading. Couldn't 

  be more right. I had to turn on god mode so that I could properly 'evaluate' 

  the map. There's plenty of ammo for everyone. Well placed items and guns. What 

  doesn't this map have?!! It's also got a waterfall and a little pool too!! It's 

  not only bigger than cliff1, it's also really fast. You shouldn't have any trouble 

  running this on your computer people, so download it!! I'm outta breath. Check 

  it out for yourself! Later. <Br>

<p> <b>Review:</b><br>

  Apart from the guys at the mapdepot and those who beta tested this map I had 

  it at least 2 hours before you lot because Ace kindly stuck it up on his site, 

  http://tasqs.telefragged.com I quickly invited a friend over and played 1 on 

  1 deathmatch, then 1 on 1 teamplay. This map is superb. I liked the original 

  but I'll never go back to it after this. I agree with Ace when he says that 

  the blue sky hes now put in is much better. It gives the map a sort of spring 

  morning feel, combined with the waterfall a more apropriate name would Oasis 

  or Paradise. Unfortunatly you have to go around blowing peoples heads off in 

  here. Ace also said that you fall more easily here but I disagree with that. 

  The water makes sure that you quite often can take a running jump and with any 

  luck only have minor injuries. Teamplay will be very good and this map should 

  be in the team map-pack. There are ways of flanking the enemy, sniping from 

  several places, unlike the original. The map seems to be heavily focussed around 

  the M5 allthough getting it is risky and exposed due to the number of sniper 

  spots viewing it. The M4 however has at least 4 rounds of ammo and is much more 

  sheltered. The only other gripe I've got is in the placement of the sniper rifle. 

  Surely it should be on the top of the hill where the shotgun is? 

<p> This map is paradise and apart from the small grudge I've got about the weapons 

  I see npthing at all to fault in this map. <br>

<p> <b>Review:</b><br>

  Hey there boys and girls! The Rookie (formally Bobby the Rookie) is back for 

  yet again another review. This time i FINALLY found a server that had a new 

  map on it on the day of it's release, and it was none othe then the sequel to 

  the popular team classic cliff. Sadly however Cliff 2 just doesn't really stand 

  up to the original (sudden gasp bursts out of the audience.) 

<p> I'll give Ace some credit. Instead of making a "cliff with maybe a few extras 

  for fun" like so many other sequel maps (mall2, acticity2, ruins2) Cliff 2 is 

  a bran new map from the ground up. A lot of work was put into this map and it 

  shows. Aesthitically it looks amazing. The sky, the textures, the cliffs, even 

  the water and cute waterfalls just show the amount of effort put into this map. 

<p> Basic outline of this map is that it's just one big canyon with lost of little 

  lakes, nooks and cranies where fighting can get fast and furious.The trademark 

  cliff cable car makes a triumphant return and remaians the worst source of transportation 

  in this map (sorry Ace!) The attention to detail is amazing. it truly shows 

  how much pride this mapper which makes me feel REAL bad to say the following. 

<p> From a gampley standpoint, this map is bad, REAL bad. The map is way to open 

  for starters. The lack of cover turns the game into a fire fest, with no strategy, 

  just point and aim. In fact the only cover can be found hiding in the valleys 

  bellow. Which brings me to my next point, the spawn points suck. Too often has 

  my entire team died due to my team being put in "fish in a barrel" situations. 

  This brings in another gripe, the lvel is too dominated by automatics with laser 

  sigths that there really isn't any other way to go, thus killing startegy again. 

  Oddly enuff however, i do think this might make a good DM map, but i've enver 

  played it DM yet so I wouldn't know (sorrt again Ace.) 

<p> Cliff is a classic but Cliff 2 falters in the gameplay apect of things. It's 

  too bad, since this map look like there was a lot of effot put into this map.

<p> <b>Review:</b><br>

  Well what can be said about Cliff2. Yes everyone has been waiting for it, and 

  everyone loves the original Cliff... except me. As in the first Cliff map, Cliff2 

  has an abundance of areas were, if one does not watch his or her step, one will 

  plummet to certain death. Sure this makes for a good time watching someone fly 

  to their doom after being shot or jump kicked, but I find it rather annoying 

  to constantly be falling, breaking my legs, and losing well earned frags. 

<p> Ok, this is an excellently designed map that flows extremely well. The layout 

  of weapons is superb, but there is way to much ammo. Whomever has the MP5 or 

  the M4 will be in heaven with the amount of spair magazines casually laying 

  about the stone floors. I was pleased with the frame rate of this map, because 

  it is quite open, but some of the environmental factors seemed unrealistic... 

  mainly the waterfall. The waterfall looks impressive, and it is fun to swim 

  through, but one will notice that it is possible to swim upward against its 

  current, thus defying laws of common physics. 

<p> Well that's about all I have to say. This map has both good Death Match and 

  Teamplay capabilities, and also an immense annoyance factor (if you don't like 

  like free falls that is).

<p> <b>Review:</b><br>

  CLIFF2 is a good example of a map that's one build away from excellence. 

<p> The Layout is very good and far less prone to the annoying fatal falls that 

  Cliff 1 was. There are more nooks and crannies to manouver in, and for team-play 

  the opportunies to flank the opposition will make for some great games. 

<p> It has low r_speeds on average, peaking at 600-700, but more often than not 

  sitting around 400-550. With a GL Card this won't be a problem. 

<p> From an aesthetic point-of-view, however, there are some things I'll take 

  issue with: 

<p> 1 -- The Water. Yes, there's water and while the idea is good the execution 

  is weak. The Map maker obviously hadn't had much experience modelling water 

  before, since curret seems to be mising. What this means is instead of a river 

  which pulls you down stream (and over the falls) you can swim UP the water fall. 

  Also the transparency is set at 33, meaning the water is almost invisible. It 

  looks sloppy. A shame since a few extra hours of testing and compiling time 

  (a lot of functions like water and sun_light can be tested in smaller maps before 

  being applied to the final BSP) and it could've worked well as an enhancement. 

<p> 2 -- The lighting is flat and uninteresting. I'm not sure if he used the QRAD 

  sun feature and dialed up the ambiance, or just lit it using sky, but the dramatic 

  shadows and red rock texture of Cliff 1 are gone. Instead everything tends to 

  be a vague shade of white light and almost shadowless. 

<p> This map may play just great (which is what really counts) but it could've 

  looked and played better (which is a shame).

<p> <b>Review:</b><br>

  Well im a HUGE fan of the origonal map Cliff. To me it is one of the best ( 

  if not the best :] ). I play on a server name Karmann's A that plays just that 

  map in teamplay. Some of my friends play their. Cousteau, Kevin, McBeth, McBain, 

  Doug Howser, Doug Quaid, Sniper... (if any of u read this put a message at the 

  message board on action.telefragged for me including the IP for that server). 

  I LOVE that map. That map was so awsome because people would comicly fall to 

  their deaths, you were rewarded with a CRUNCH OOOHH and you laughed to your 

  hearts content. Then when you die (if you die :]) tou can laugh some more and 

  swap battle stories. Because of the stories and getting to know those who play 

  with you and becoming a machine of death (Cousteau and Kevin im talkling to 

  u guys about us three... HEHEHE) that is why I love teamplay, and that is right 

  fully why I love Cliff. 

<p> Cliff2 thoughoroly ( I hate spelling ) dissapointing. The large falls that 

  made Cliff a blast are coushined by water, slopes are everywhere alowing you 

  to quickly asail the tops while in Cliff it was choke pointed by stairs and 

  ladders. Both sides of the cliff is accasable by about 4 ways (bothe sides, 

  a landbridge and the cable car). But most of all the dangerous walks by the 

  cliff edge are blunted some and are non exestent. Now you really have to work 

  to fall of a durring a gun fight <G>. 

<p> I think I represent to average gamer. I have a 166 non mmx, 48 megs of ram, 

  a 14 inch SVGA monitor, and a Stealth 220. Cliff2 never really bogged down at 

  all. It wins my admiration there. But its heart was cut out with the lack of 

  fun action paced gameplay (meaning LARGE falls). Cliff2 is still a good map, 

  dont get me wrong there, i like it alright. I just beleive that cliff one was 

  better. The map still invites snipers and still allows them to fall as easily 

  as their prey. It c-o-u-l-d be played in DM but that is streching it alittle. 

  To me that is where the cliff spirit died. The DM was completly ignored in the 

  origional cliff (atleast mostly). 

<p> I still like Cliff2 but the origonal will always have a place with me. 

<p> Happy Fragging<br>

<p> <b>Review:</b><br>

  This map looks great. but looks arent everything. I do prefer this map over 

  Cliff because of the water and being able to jump off the top of the cliff to 

  the bottom of the water fall...besides this I feel this map isnt all that good 

  for teamplay. One reason is there is no cover. I often found within 20 seconds 

  the match was over. This is mainly due to the fact that when teams spawn they 

  are facing each other (seperated by a couple hundered feet) but none the less 

  facing each other...this means if there is a sniper on one side he could easily 

  take out at least one person before we have a chance to run for cover...also 

  I found that some spawn points were uneven...often 1 team would spawn at the 

  bottom and another above them with a clear advantage...Also just like Cliff 

  the chances of slipping are still very likely. I do on the other hand think 

  it is much easier than the previous map to get to another side...there is no 

  real 1 sided advantage as far as 1 side from another...

<p> <b>Review:</b><br>

  As soon as I entered this map and took a little look around, I was saying to 

  myself, "I have GOT to review this map!". So here it is... 

<p> First off, hit your back button, click on "cliff2" and start the download 

  now... Ok, NOW read the review... 

<p> The first thing you will notice when you enter this map is that, yes, it is 

  big, bigger than the original cliff. To try and describe this map with words 

  is pointless - you have to see it. It seems that the author has done such a 

  good job making this map look natural that there is no way to describe it. From 

  rolling hills to waterfalls, ditches and landbridges, there is no easy way to 

  put this map into words. It does resemble the original cliff, the cable car 

  stayed, as did the huge hill in the center that divides the map in half, but 

  many improvements have been made. One of my favorite is the addition of water. 

  Scenic and fun to romp around in, water actually serves a much more important 

  purspose in a map like this - breaking falls. It's fun to be kicked off the 

  top of the hill and think, "I'm dead." but then you find yourself floating in 

  a little pool of water and you laugh and go running back of the hill for revenge. 

  The cable car is improved, too. It is now possible to get ontop of the wire 

  and run back and forth on your own, and, if you choose to actually use the cable 

  car itself you'll be pleased to know that it now moves at a faster speed , so 

  you might actually have a chance of not getting pegged while your riding. The 

  hill is more accessable now because it isn't as steep as the one from the original 

  cliff. No new textures that I could tell, but it still looks really nice. Oh, 

  is your download done? Well stop reading this and happy fragging! <br>

<p> <b>Review:</b><br>

  Wow. Very cool. Very true to the original cliff. This thing is basically cliff, 

  with everything revamped and made cooler. I like the adunbance of water, now 

  every fall isn't deadly. Cliff will always have a place, but cliff2 is just 

  some new material. I like what he did to the tram. It is faster, and more open. 

  The r_speeds in this map are very good, especially for an outdoor map (when 

  tim made jungle1, did he even know what r_speeds were? :). 

<p> Good weapons placement, good design, but not quite as "spikey" as cliff, the 

  cliff is more "benign", it is flat on the top. 

<p> The only negative in this map I can think of is it loses the "really high" 

  feel. It seems closed in and smaller than the original cliff. Otherwise, great 

  map. Keep up the work Ace12GA. <Br>

<p> <b>Review:</b><br>

  This is my first review. So you can laugh all you want. I'm a very big fan of 

  Ace's first Cliff map. I remember first playing it. It was love at first site. 

  I couldn't wait for the sequel so I could fall in love all over again... Well.. 

  let's just say I over estimated this map. 

<p> Now don't get me wrong! It's an OK map. But it's definatly not the sequel 

  to Cliff. The only thing that reminded me of cliff was the cable car. Which 

  I didnt really like in the first cliff anyway. 

<p> The so called bases. Or metal blocks on each side of the map dont serve that 

  much purpose. Every part of the map is waaaayyyy to easy to get to, and am I 

  the only one who has noticed you can swim up the waterfalls? (Maybe it's just 

  me). 

<p> When I played this map in a server I felt like a hamster running around in 

  his cage. The same stuff over and over again! No big holes with ladders leading 

  down into them, or high points in the mountain side. (If thats what it's suppposed 

  to be). I just can't see how people could say this map is even half as good 

  as Cliff or jsut about any other map for that matter. <Br>

<p> <b>Review:</b><br>

  First off, i was not very impressed with the original cliff, simply because 

  the wide open areas always cause lag with internet play, and thus jiggy movement 

  on top of my already low fps, it's not too bad when i'm running around by myself 

  in single player... but, it's horrible when playing internet games, cliff2 improves 

  a little on most of the lag in alot of areas, although staring over towards 

  the cablecar crossing either way causes mad fps slowdown. While the layout of 

  this map is pretty good and i can see why many people like this map (fragfest, 

  quick teamplay games) these are things i DON'T think that make a good action 

  map, sure i admit, sitting waiting for the last 2 guys in a map like blockwar 

  can get very annoying, but that's what teamplay maps are all about, plenty of 

  places to surprise your enemy from, not so open areas. cliff2 is a blast in 

  dm but, like with the original cliff, i still do not like it in teamplay, most 

  people will use the mp5/laser combo all the time, cutting the teamplay strategy 

  needed down to a lame machine gun 'point and spray technique'. Now, on the architecture 

  of this level, it's much improved over the original, but the water (very transparent? 

  i almost thought i was going to fall down and die the first time i played the 

  map, should be at least visible..) is not very good, and some of the cliff areas 

  don't look so sloped (of course i know how hard it is to create a good sloped 

  surface that doesn't kill the r_speeds so i won't really criticize that too 

  much ;). weapons placement in this map is ok, although i think the automatic 

  weapons like the mp5 and m4 should have been on the bottom of the map so they 

  aren't so easy to get. Textures, this map had no really great textures, the 

  base rock texture used was from quake2, and i feel it would stand out a whole 

  lot more if ace12ga had put just an extra few minutes to make some custom textures, 

  or get someone to make him some. overall, this map is ok, i'm still not overly 

  impressed with it, a few tweaks and changes here and there. <br>

<p> <b>Review:</b><br>

  Well, my expectations for this map where mile-high when I saw it was released, 

  and I downloaded it as fast as I could. This was the sequel for maybe the most 

  popular map so far? After my oppinion Cliff was one of the top 3 maps out there, 

  especially in Teamplay - where Cliff gives the two teams a chance to show off 

  their tactics. This map wasn't as great as I expected, with little difference 

  from the original. Cliff2 has the same textures and the same lift going from 

  base to base, and those high tops perfect for snipers. There has been som changes 

  though, like the water and a little more complex "valley" between the two bases. 

  Personally I think that Cliff is better than Cliff2, I don't like it's sequel. 

  Hopefully servers wont change Cliff to Cliff2 on their map lists, because it 

  isn't worth it. If Cliff wasn't out, Cliff2 would also have been one of the 

  top 3 maps out there - but when we've got Cliff who needs Cliff2 ? :-) Anyway, 

  let's go right to the scores!

<p> <b>Review:</b><br>

  Well, after much thought I'm going to give this map a bad review. The layout 

  of this map, ecspecially for teamplay really is too open, and not enough cover. 

  You can flank, but this turns in to too much of a frag fest. Also there are 

  some bad mofo spawn points where it's like shooting fish in a barrel. This map 

  also has flaws with the water (the current doesn't work) also the water needs 

  to be more visible, it can hardly be seen. The cliffs that were cliff1 most 

  prominent feature are almost non existent, Cliff2 was just a big disappointment. 

<p> Structure and Design -4/10- Really we all like cliff for one feature, CLIFFS! 

  Everyone likes it when it's like one on one, and someone makes a fatal step 

  off the edge then splat. Water and angled cliffs cushion your fall so you can 

  strafe with no real regard to falling off. It's too wide open to play on teamplay, 

  at least on cliff it was hard to get to the enemy base. Usually requiring going 

  through some small passage and up a ladder of some sort. I loved the ladders 

  and camping right by them, it required strategy that way. This map promotes 

  too much of a frag fest to be a fun map. 

<p> Spawn Points -2/10- Some really bad spawn points here, where well, you are 

  the trapped rat in water sort of deal And the enemy is able to come and blow 

  away your helpless bodies. If you have a map like this, some more thought needs 

  to be considered when making this map. 

<p> Detail -5/10- Errors on a map really irritate me, like to currrent on the 

  water (you can swim up a water fall) or bad spawn point details. It also looks 

  so bland on my computer, I was tired of playing it after a short while. This 

  map definetely needed a lot more testing before it was published. Map makers 

  need to learn that small little mistakes detract from the map, ecspecially from 

  picky reviewrs like me. 

<p> Gameplay -6/10- Really the most important category, but this map lacks in 

  the teamplay area of gameplay (I'm not really a DMer) IT has way too many ways 

  to the enemy base, which turns it into everyone with automatic weapons going 

  for it rambo style. Really you don't need teamwork on this map because it is 

  that open. At least on a map like Actcity teams can defend or charge depending 

  on who is leading them, but it's closed off enough to where teams have to act 

  like a team. This map comes way too much down to which team has the better players, 

  not necessarily the best teamwork. I remember once I was on a stacked team against 

  a team of people who weren't that good, but we got spanked because they were 

  always together, and us always apart (enough ranting from me) I like strategy 

  and I love being able to make up for lack of skill for good teamwork. 

<p> Overall -4.5/10- I would play this map if it comes up on the server, but really 

  it's nothing special. Like a lot of sequels it is a far cry from the original. 

  Maybe this is the result of too much hype surrounding this map, and frankly 

  I was expecting a lot more from this map. Cliffe had hyped it up as a great 

  map, so I was expecting alot and didn't get it. Download it and play it, it's 

  not so bad to not play it if it comes on a server, but not good enough to request 

  it be put on a server <Br>

<p> <b>Review:</b><br>

  This map was something of a disappointment after all the buildup, at least from 

  a teamplay point of view. I really like Cliff1 because of the danger of falling 

  and the guts it takes to rush the other side with only a few avenues to do so. 

  This map is much more of a DM map. There are few risky falls that are not cushioned 

  by water (although I quickly found the few on the board). There is absolutely 

  no cover that cannot be overrun in about 5 seconds and the teams start 2 seconds 

  from firing distance half the time. This board is ruled by the M5 and laser. 

<p> I was hoping for more of the first cliffs, one where there were a few crossing 

  points that only the brave would dare cross. Those who hate snipers will love 

  this board. Snipers and HPBs will suffer a painful fate here. The map is one 

  of the best looking I've seen and has alot going for it, but it definitely belongs 

  on the DM servers and not the teamplay.<BR>

<p> <b>Review:</b><br>

  Let me first say--I primarily play teamplay, and so any map i play I look at 

  from that perspective. However, this is a fun deathmatch level. Fast, not so 

  huge that you *MUST* snipe, not so small that handcannons and shotguns rule 

  the world. Smart play and a pistol can beat a M4 on this level, but it takes 

  some work (as it should ;).

<p> Now, lets move on to teamplay. Here, again, this map is fun. Fast, yes, and 

  yes it does only take a few seconds to get to the other side. But, the layout 

  is such that a couple of decent snipers can hold the base while the machine 

  guns and shot guns fight for the middle. Additionally, the loved/hated choke 

  points are less choked (but still there). You have four choices, two of which 

  are so nasty they almost shouldn't be considered as options. First, you can 

  go across with the cable, either in the trolly or on the cable itself. The reasons 

  to not do this are obvious--go ahead and stand still in the open, you'll get 

  the same results. Second, you can go across the ledge on the side (right side 

  if you are on the side with the waterfall); however, this again has the same 

  drawback--you will be in the open on a narrow path the entire way. You can cross 

  on the bottom. This is fun--no matter how people complain, the ditch is a great 

  place to fight in. Only the sniper rifle has a definite disadvantage--all other 

  weapons are pretty equal if you know how to use the terrain. And while you are 

  at a disadvantage with people firing from the top, you still have some cover 

  and they have much more of their backs exposed than you do (if you are on a 

  good team, this is something to be considered seriously). Finally, you can play 

  'king of the hill'. Usually, this is how all the M4s and shotguns die, is rushing 

  maddly to get to the top before the other team does. Domination of the hill 

  can translate to domination of the round--a slight weakness in the map, but 

  not a fatal one if your snipers have cleared the other paths of players. Additionally, 

  there is a slight advantage here for the team that climbs from the side with 

  the water--they can enter in two directions without major hassle, and they can 

  also walk off at two different spots. I suppose this makes up for the being 

  fairly well trapped by the ditch on the other side (again, a weakness in the 

  map, but can be worked around).

<p> Finally, let me talk about the much maligned water on this level. Yes, it 

  is light. Yes, you can go UP the waterfalls. So what? This level seems all about 

  fast thinking and quick adaption to situation (which team controls the hill, 

  which path do you take from this spawn point with your current weapon, etc). 

  Why is this relevant? Because levels with opaque (or extremely close) water 

  almost always find a few people who camp out in them, surfacing for air only 

  when necessary, and waiting to hear footsteps. On this level, that would be 

  lame in the extreme, and the see-through water prevents this. Play the map some, 

  then answer this question--Do you really want someone able to camp unseen in 

  either one of the ponds, or anywhere in the waterfall system? It may have been 

  unintentional, but it is a good thing.

<p> Same is true with the lack of currents. If you couldn't climb up the waterfall, 

  the only way out of the ditch or lower pond would be up that ladder. After a 

  few AP rounds to the head, most people would delete the map, quit playing AQ2, 

  and take up golf full time (ok, maybe not the second two). Having the 'water 

  ladder' provides a second (albeit also not very good) way of getting out of 

  the bottom pond.

<p> As for not falling as easily--GOOD! The original cliff was death to anyone 

  with ploss (regardless of their ping) because the server would never get the 

  info that you turned, or stopped moving forward, or jumped. Now, you have fewer 

  places to fall at. The best thing related to falling in the original is still 

  in place in this--you can still shoot people off a ledge and almost across the 

  map. Happy thoughts truly aren't good enuff--you gotta teach those suckers how 

  to fly. Enuff from me, I highly recommend this map. Bright, so no subway2 syndrome. 

  Multiple paths to the bases, so no Desert Bases syndrome. Fairly simple and 

  very open, so no 10 minute delays while 2 people try to find each other (ala 

  Museum or Blockwar). Fast and furious, and any weapon can work.

<p> <b>Review:</b><br>

  When I heard that there was going to be another cliff map - I thought "Oh no! 

  Not the one where you die from falling damage everywhere you go!" I strongly 

  dislike Cliff. 

<p> However, I DLed Cliff2 anyway and found a teamplay server that had it going. 

<p> For 1 on 1 Teamplay, the map is actually quite good because on the upper cliffs, 

  you can see where your opponent is from far away (therefore avoiding annoying 

  situations where people spend 10 minutes looking for each other for a 3 second 

  gun fight) But, it isn't a shootfest, because the upper cliffs tend to be far 

  away from each other. 

<p> What this map seems to be best for is DM because of the open space in the 

  middle, one can snipe into the bloodbath or join in on the fun with akimbo. 

<p>The falling damage is not a factor as much because of the water. Instead of 

  falling off a ladder or something (Cliff1) you can safely drop into the lake. 

<p> This map really shines in normal DM. I played Eraserbot with 7 enemies and 

  had a blast. Thank goodness they're compatible. 

<p>Lastly, there's the visual effect. They're so good they stink. I stop to admire 

  the sky texture or look down from the cablecar and admire the scenery and I 

  have a bullet in my head. This map is too good looking. I often have to change 

  the sky to avoid distraction... :) 

<p> 9/10

<p> <b>Review:</b><br>

  First review. I just have to say that this is one of the best maps I've played. 

  In the past few weeks, map quality has really improved. 

<p> Structure and Design: Great! All the areas of this map flow together perfectly. 

  The author knew what he wanted this map to look like, right from the beginning. 

  The waterfalls actually serve a purpose, either as a quick getaway or as a great 

  sniping spot (trust me). The trolley is just as much fun as it was in the first 

  cliff map. If you have balls of steel, go ahead and ride it. Although it is 

  alot of fun to pepper the entire trolley with machine gun fire and see the person 

  inside jump to his doom. Great design. 

<p> Weapons Placement: Beats me. The only way I have played this map is through 

  teamplay. Judging on the quality of the map though. There is probably great 

  weapons placement. 

<p> Gameplay: Excellent! Some maps get old real quick, but this one just gets 

  better and better. There is so much strategy to use on this map, it will never 

  get old. Use the sniper rifle, mp5, m4, shotgun, or handcannon. You can have 

  success with every weapon if you know how to use them. One of the most enjoyable 

  maps to play. Never gets boring. 

<p> Framerates: Extremely good. I have a Pentium 200 with a Monster 3D card. No 

  slow down at all. I didn't check to see what it was like without hardware acceleration, 

  but in the future I will. 

<p> How it looks: This is such a beautiful map. I love maps that are bright and 

  well lit. I've seen so many maps with good design wasted by being too dark. 

  Eye candy. 

<p> Overall:<br>

  Structure & Design: 9/10<br>
  Weapons Placement: ?<br>

  Gameplay: 9/10<br>

  Framerates: 9/10<br>

  Looks: 10/10<br>

<p> Overall score: 9/10 

<p>Great looking map, mappers should use this map as an example of how a great 

  map make Action Quake2 kick serious ass! <br>

<b>Review:</b><br>

OK im gona make this one REAL short, 1. it was over hyped, 2. please put a current 

on the water! 3. No element of danger from falling (theres too much water!) 4. 

Beacuse there is no danger form falling, it shouldnt be named cliff but something 

more aporpriate like... "cliff with big river in middle to save you from falling" 

Im really pissed at ace this time, c'mon, less water, FLOWING water, and next 

time, dont over hype your map, otherwise it will turn out to be just like riven 

(god i hate that game) If he would have made less water, WAY less ammo, and flowing 

water this would be a great map! im gona have to e-mail ace and tell him he needs 

to make a "cliff 2 vertion 2" if you would mail him too about these, maby we can 

get a great map! Struture 7/10 (too much water) Design 10/10 (well make it a 9/10 

beacue of the water) Weapon Placemnt and Ammo 3/10 wayy to much ammo like the 

original cliff Looks 10/10 at least its not so bright! overall 7/10 The water 

saved me a few times too many, i deserved to die for not watching my step, make 

a 2nd vertion with less water would ya?<br>
