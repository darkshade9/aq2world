<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>well, the layout of night raid is rather good with tents and the long grass as well as boxes. There is just enough cover to be able to hide and too little to be able to have a dominating spot where no-one can kill you. I have not played it in a big teamplay game, but my guess is that it would not be good-not a very big map. I played it against my cousin in a 1 on 1 game and it rocked hard! There is enough room to sneak about in a small game and sneaking about is what this map is all about. There are no buildings, and there is always room to run away</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>well.. My computer is no beast so I don't know if Im qualified to rate how it looks. It looks ok on my computer (what you can see of it). The shadows completely black out some areas. I don't think the shadows are overdone as it is that sort of map. It is not really much to look at BUT since the map is set at night, there is not much to see anyway..</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>The funfactor is its greatest asset. When playing a 1 on 1 you sneak around - waiting to hear a sound of a footstep. The suspense is terrific. Sneaking up behind someone and knifeing them in the back or putting a handcannon to their head is fun, to say the least. Sneaking up on someone is relativly easy and most kills are because of suprise. The long grass is the key, as when crouching, only your head and shoulders are visible. Couple this with a skin like &quot;Commando&quot; and you are practicaly invisible.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>The mood set by the lights (or lack of) is great. Not being able to see everthing around you is great and is the ultimate suspense not knowing what is 2 meteres in front of you. Tense and jumpy this map, Being shot in the back of the head at point blank range because you were careless scares the hell out of you to say the least. Most of the time being killed means time for a quick pants change. Very good atmosphere.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>Well, overall this is a good if not great map for small games. Stealth and downright sneakyness is the key to winning on this map. Very good map for small games and 1 on 1 deathmatchesare are excellent.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>This map has nothing new in it. The layout is functional and guessable, but rather
cramped too. The level looks spacious at first, but upon playing it in TP
for a couple of times, I noticed that it gets crowded real fast.
The only thing worth complaining here is that rushing with auto weapons seems
to be the most efficient tactic employed. The layout favors rushers too
much when compared to other weapons.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>This part is hard to write for me, since at first it was hard to find anything to look at all!
Goddamn, boys, it's dark in there. 
The textures are nothing wonderful, but no outright sucking either. The tents and 
other thingumies look ok and do not irritate my eye. I will, however, bitch about the lighting.
At first I thought that a dark map would be lovely to play, since Sniper+Silencer is my faved combo.
The problem is that I can't see a damn thing through the scope, so no point in using it.
Gl_modulate does not help since I don't want to turn the night into day.
Now think for a while. It's not really _that_ dark out there at night, is it? I mean, we don't take IR lamps
with us on a night walk. A bit more ambient light, please...</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>Haven't tried this in DM (I am a TP-only -person) but from what I saw in TP matches, it just didn't work.
It takes about 2 seconds after "action" to hear an MP5 spray out somewhere, then you get hit in the head.
In the central area I saw the enemies only when they were standing right next to me inside stabbing range,
and IR did not help solve this problem either, since I still couldn't see where I was going. 
Without spray weapons the matches were chaotic and lasted well less than 20 seconds for me. 
I really don't think this is what TP is about, so I can't give very many points to this one.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>Ho, now this is where Night Raid is at its best. The feeling.
The background sound is nice and fits in very well. (But it is a bit too loud...)
The big lamps throw nice circles of illumination on the ground and 
this map really looks like what its supposed to represent.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Other Comments:</B><BR></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>All in all, what this map needs is a bit more light and space.
This would allow for better TP and tactical maneuvers.
I bet some people do like this, but I feel it lacks too many things
to be really enjoyable.</FONT><P>
