<b>Review:</b><br>

The "I should've been Office3," Quttin is a good big map, and believe me, there are VERY few good big Action Quake maps.

<p>

Basically Action Quake (in my opinion) is only fun when you get into these huge run, duck and cover gun fights that resemble the last few scenes in John Woo's the "The Killers." Quttin helps create this by really making a convicing looking office area. The cramp hallways and cubicle filled rooms keep the action intense when you find someone. I personally like to grab the hand cannon and hide in one of the many closets, waiting for some poor sucker in search of ammo to open the door and BLAMMO.

<p>

Quittin's look fits it's theme very well, with coloured carpets and simple wall textures. Rooms are actually filled with tables, cubicles, couches etc. unlike Office3's huge empty rooms which made you think "what the hell kind of office is this?" Level design is very cool. The rooms aren't too big or too small and cluttered. The parking lot leaves a lot to be desired but atleast it has the big black limo made famous by hastage 2. The map also includes a lot of ways to get around the huge 5 level office building, including an elevator, fire escape and two sets of stairs. Neeto!

<p>

Weapons placement is good, esepecially the M4 which is a bastard to find and should be in every map, because it gives newbies too much of a chance (learn to use the shotgun damn it!!!) Back on topic Ammo is abundant, but is sparse due to the sheer size of the level. Another thing to not is that the authour didn't go "grenade crazy", i've palyed too many levels with too many greanades in them and boy does it make the game boring.

<p>

In terms of strategy Quittins diverse level design allows all types of strategies to be used. Shotgun fan? Hang around the stairs. Like to be a sniper? Standing on the rooftop is a great place to pick people off people. And for those grenade loving assholes there are enough open areas to chuck those things into the middle of a gun fight.

<p>

Overall Qutting is a great map, especially for the bigger games. The design is great, the look is great, it's just a great map!!! So what are you waiting for!! Go play it!!

Now damn it!!! =)
