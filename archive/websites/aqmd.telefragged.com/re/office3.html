<b>Review:</b><br>

Hello, its me, back again with my fourth review!? This time I will be tackling A Night In Hong Kong, aka office3. This is one of the original maps, and to this day, still one of the all-around best AQ2 maps. It was designed by Cail, the head of the A-Team.

<p>

First off lets start with the design. Again, very simple, yet effective. An office type building, which consists of a garage, 2 floors of offices, and the rooftop. There are doors to each room, but they arent used at all. Players just jump into rooms and out, like the energizer bunny. This is one of the downfalls of this classic, but there arent many others. This could have been a very strategic map, had there been glass in the windows of the offices (however, this would cause major slowdown for software players). But hey, what can you do?

<p>

Next up is the weapons placement, which was done very well. The shotgun's in the bar, the grenades are outdoors, the mp5 is under the garage stairs, the sniper rifle is in a room, and handcannon, OMG! Where the hell is the handcannon, i have no clue.........Anyway, the placement is great.

<p>

All in all, a great map. With some minor improvements (maybe some desks in a frikkin' office!), this could have been of the Top 5 maps.
