<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>being an extention of his original city, the new layout add's more flow to the map.... more escapes.... and more surprise ambushes....<br>after running around the map a while I was only saddened by one of the old rooms (*the one above the new song radio*) didn't have its old escape.... but this is a good thing when considering the map for DM.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>if you loved the theme Ruskprik had goin with City.... you'll love it here.... the old room and radio are there and the TV still blows up (although I think it should show something pathetic... I get dismayed at blowing up the AQ2 logo). but now theres another song (possibly from the same movie???) and new lighting in parts.<br>I was only dismayed at seeing a few blank looking walls where the old bill boards used to be, but they were shifted to a new location.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>the mood is fun.... the songs and the movie theme and the love heart carpet tells you that. but its still a great place to frag.... with a few lighting changes it could be made into a very dark and murderous map.... </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>This map has a wicked layout. It's almost like the map city, except with some new modifications. I like the pipes that you can climb, helps get around the map easier.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>This map has a nice darkish look to it. I personally play in software mode (bad graphics card), but from the screenshots I've seen with a OpenGL card it's awesome!</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>The mood is that of a city, but maybe someday someone will make a sort of bot code so people and cars can be on the streets :-). The ambiant light is pretty good. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>You have to love the &quot;Koso&quot; room, and the 2 radios and TVs :-).</FONT><P>

CTBCity takes the great map City, and gives it a whole new look and feel. 
The map gives the feel of a real city much more convincingly then anything out there at the moment.
Apartment buildings are plentiful, and trashcans/cardboard boxes are scattered evenly throughout.
There's even approriately placed, climbable drainpipes, giving you easy access to the rooftops.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>Beautiful.
<P>
The map has a strange, purple lighting to it that is different to any other map i've seen. (Apart from the obvious original City)</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>The more the merrier.
<P>
This map is great for deathmatch, teamplay, and Capture the Brifcase alike. The second you get a good amount of people in the server, then things really get going. The seemingly abundant amount of windows gives great opportunities for snipers, and the narrow, twisting hallways and alleys are a hand cannon users dream. And of course there's nothing better then a bit of Karlsson magic to light up your match.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 9/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>Immersive.
<P>
"fi-fi-fi-filura" by Karlsson playing on an old stereo along side a broken television in an alley-way was one of the first things i came accross when i fired up CTBCity. The ambiance is fantastic, it's realistic city setting is unmatched by any map, yes, even the popular Urban series by Gerbil! Drainpipes, alleyways, apartment buildings, trashcans and cardboard boxes are the name of the game in CTBCity.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>There's a new Karlsson song "fi-fi-fi-filura" for your enjoyment, but unfortunately there's always one fool who will go and kill the radio. I feel society is to blame.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>CTBCity will rock your world. Takes the classic City and gives it a healthy dosage of crack. Complex and immersive, CTBCity is the only map i'll be voting for on my favourite servers for a long time to come.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>Here again with another map review is The Rookie! Here we are looking at another excellent map from Ruskprick, specifically made for CTB.
<P>
CTBcity builds upon the original city and imrpoves it in someways. The map is a lot larger for one thing. There are more roof top areas to run around and it's basically easier to navigate around the map. Basically, pretty much better then the original City except for the flag spawn points (ugh!)</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Looks Rating:</B> 10/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>Ruskpricks bright style often reminds me of music video director MC G
(Got The Life, Pretty Fly(For A White Guy).) Birght pastels are the norm in city, and while it may seem a little odd it does add to the humour factor brought on by our good friend MC Karrlson. The look of the map is just superb. </FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Gameplay Rating:</B> 10/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>While made for CTB i can easily see TP being played on CTBcity. The level has a lot of nooks and cranies to hide in, a large area to run around in, lots of cover and cool sniper roost. It's just a perfect map. </FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 10/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>MC Karlson, that's all I gotta say. The happy mood and look of CTBcity may seem to contrast AQ2's gritty gameplay but I actually find it hilarious in a sick sort of way. Just imagince blowing a guy away through the window of some kids window and you'll see what I mean.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Other Comments:</B><BR></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial"><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>CTBcity is another excellent map from Ruskprick. Chock full of originality, fun and overall gameplay value CTBcity should find a home on most servers. </FONT><P>
