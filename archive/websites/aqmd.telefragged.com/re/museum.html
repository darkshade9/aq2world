  <b>Review:</b><br>

<p> Alright, a review of this map is long overdew, and I think it hasn't gotten 

  enough expouser because of all the other maps that came out around the same 

  time as this. On with the review... 

<p> Gameplay - 10/10 This has got to be one of THE funnest maps I've ever played. 

  I mean, its just like you were in one of thoose movies, where its at night in 

  a closed-up building, and you've broken in and started shooting lotsa' shit. 

  (And isn't that what Action Quakes SUPPOSED to be like? ;). You've got SO much 

  attention to detail in this map its incredible. For example, you have scanned 

  pictures of REAL paintings. Oh, then theres the "Wet Floor" sign, and a floor 

  that you slip all over on. Its just plain awesome. 

<p> Weapon and Ammo Placement - 9/10 I really liked the way Shmitz laid out where 

  all the weapons went, it was really smooth and balanced. The only thing I found 

  was, theres alittle too much sniper ammo, but hey, this map was ment for lots 

  of people. 

<p>Software Mode - 7/10 This is the maps only down side. When you look at the 

  skylites, you may/will get slowdown on a non-3D accelerated machine. Other than 

  that though, its sweet. 

<p> 3D Rendered Mode - 10/10 The lighting in this is a beauty, perfect... I just 

  love it all. You can expect great FPS even with a voodoo1 card on a normal, 

  good 'ol pentium system. 

<p> Grand Total: 9/10 

<p> This map just plain old "r0x0rz your s0x0rz!". Gotta love it. Though I would 

  of liked a reception desk in the main room, the r_speeds would of been too high. 

  Ah well.. what can ya do eh? Why are you still here? Go grab it and hop on a 

  server and frag some museum ass! <br>

  POOR BOY'S REVIEW #2 <br>

  (see my review of Airport for an explanation of the POOR BOY thing) <br>

  This map is tremendous, and I am not referring to the size alone. 

<p> This is a very good example on how to keep the POOR BOY happy. Framerates 

  are always good, the texturing is VERY WELL DONE (with the possible exception 

  of some fullbright 'speckles' on some of the paintings- can you only see things 

  like this in software mode?) 

<p> While I have not had the chance to test this map well in a teamplay setting, 

  for deathmatch it runs very well, as long as you have about 4 or 5 people running 

  around. One on one is not recommended by me, as the map is rather large and 

  you have trouble finding one another. 

<p> The map author obviously took some time to think about weapon placement and 

  'circulation'.... there are a couple of pleasant open fighting areas with just 

  the right amount of cover (some handy pillars, usually) which emphasize skilled 

  play. 

<p> Snipers probably get rather annoyed, as there is no obvious high-traffic area 

  to watch, despite the nooks and crannies you can hide in. 

<p> There are a couple of problems with door rotation, notably where the machine 

  gun is, if the door is open, you cant get around it to go down the corridor. 

  (Hard to explain) I cant really blame the mapmaker, rotating doors suck in the 

  quake code. (Can't blame ID really, either- I cant think of a way to fix the 

  'i am getting pushed back by this door i am opening' bug without like noclip 

  or something sloppy like that) 

<p> A stroke of brilliance is the 'wet floor' area, where the underused 'slick' 

  texture property is used to very good effect. 

<p> R_Speeds are Excellent! I only get slowdown in one place (standing atop a 

  fixture looking down into four different rooms through some glass) I never feel 

  like I am fighting the map. 

<p> One MAJOR problem- the authour negledcted to put in the sky with his map. 

  The symptoms of not having the sky is a 'trippy' looking sky- quake tends to 

  just repeat the pixels... again hard to explain. Here is the fix I use to give 

  myself a sky- I drop console and type sky space1 This gives me the sky from 

  Quake2 Satellite level, the asteroid field there. (BTW- this works all the time, 

  if you think Jungle looks better with snow, go crazy.) 

<p> All in all, a GREAT map, and I hope to see more like this one. <br>

  Hey all, this is my first review so I hope this goes well and I won't get any 

  life threating messages in my e-mail box in a week heheh :-) Ok first of all 

  I don't think that this map actually gives you a "museum" feel into it... It 

  gives you a more "large building with things in it" kinda feel... I think the 

  map maker also should have thought about us, the peolpe with no 3dfx card... 

  the r_speeds are pretty horrible in some parts of the map. On the other hand 

  the design is very well done and gives you a taste of more... I haven't played 

  the map in DM so I cannot make any decisions about weapons placement :-( The 

  detail level that Shmitz gave this map is aweasome... I like the wet floor thingy 

  heh! Though this map does not give you a museum feel into it, it sure is action 

  material and it's just a REALLY fun map! try it out! it's really cool... By 

  the way notice that the other two reviewrs said that the r_speeds are GREAT 

  so go figuare... Grades: Action Feel - 8/10 r_speeds - 5/10 design - 8/10 weapons 

  placement - ?/10 overall - 7/10 <br>
