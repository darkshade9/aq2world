<b>Review:</b><br>

Ever heard that song "Flag Pole Sitta" by Harvey Danger? Well if you have you should play that part where he sings "paranoia paranois everybody's coming to get me!" cos this map is freaky as hell!!!

<p>

"Gee Bobby, why is this map freaky as hell?" you may ask. Quite simply it because the lighting ranges from low to none in the majourity of this map, making you crap in your pants when the only source of light is coming from the muzzle flash of some butt wipes gun.

<p>

And ambience is where Punsihers Warehouse wins, in all honesty the textures aren't all that original, and the basic design is just a few rooms attached to each other, but that's beisdes the point. The lighting is both functional and aesthetic at the same time, the attention to detail is very well done, boxes litter the romms, there's a few stylish cars for looks and there's tons of cover just in case some newbie starts going postal with the M4.

<p>

All this cover and bad lighting helps weed out the cheapness of campers and horders, making this truly an "experts" Action Quake map. Who needs a Kelvar and M4 when you can hide in the shadows and blow some poor loser away with your handcannon, or being in the dark room with 5 other guys firing your pistols madly hoping to land at least one shot. Punwar fights are crazy, but in a strategical sort of way.

<p>

Now the gripes. The only one I have is that i get bad frames and ploy break up when it gets really hectic (if you're wondering I'm running a P2 233 with a Power VR acellerator) and there's not enough ammo esepecially when games get past the ten player mark. I know the level's small but there has to be somewhere where you can cram some ammo and another grenade, in all my times of playing i've only found one!

<p>

If you like to play a pansy game of "run like a maniac and hope to take some guys down with me" don't play this map.

However if you find pleasure holding a sniper rifle in the corner of a dark room and picking losers off one by one, i highly suggest this map, it rocks!
