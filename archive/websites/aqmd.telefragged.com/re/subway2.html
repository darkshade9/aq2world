<b>Review:</b><br>

To begin, this is version2 of subway, which is a great map, some things have changed in this map over the last version, some things haven't, some of the most noticeable changes are.... The bathroom near the room with 4 tables, the textures in the buildings outside near the car and truck have undergone some changes, the book store, and the change of placement of the subway train, a winding tunnel to the train instead of just a strait path, the things i liked about this map is it's an ACTION QUAKE style map and not a QUAKE2 DM style map which we've been seeing alot of recently, mad props to the author for making this map very efficient, so i don't get the jiggy movement, ala parkgarage, ghetto, etc. no problem with the framerates AT ALL in this map, the map is kinda small, so in big games it's gets quite "chunky" in areas if you know what i mean. The things i didnt like about this map were some of the areas are so dark it's hard to distinguish just who's in dark, which is very useful in teamplay so you don't unload a clip into a friendly for no reason, also i found the car music to be VERY VERY annoying when you're sitting in that area for long periods of time. in conclusion, if i were rating this map out of a rating of 10, i would give it a 9.5, it's definitly one of the better maps out there.

Well I have to say that I'm a big fan of the Subway map and I love it when another version of maps come out, but foe some reason, this didn't excite me as much as the first one did. And here's why:

<p>

   The outside of the map (with the car) wasnt changed at all(except for a couple rooms in the buildings and the textures). The inside, T.T.I put in only one revolving door instead of 2 doors which i found more realistic cause i havn't seen a subway station with only 1 door in it.  T.T.I added a bathroom but its way too small for a 3 or 4 person battle cause its too crowded. T.T.I also added a bookroom which serves no purpose except to bandage and to pick up 1 pistol clip.

<p>

   The rest of the map stays the same. Now i have to say the lighting effects in GL (finally got it :) are superb. I love the darkblue in the M4 spot the most. I always loved this map, and id say its good for a LAN, but on a server.....TML(Too.Much.Lag).

<p>

   If your gettin bored of the old Subway, then this map would be good for a change, but if yr still goin strong on the origional, dont even waste your internet hours D/L'in this map cause it's not worth is ok???

 I play teamplay almost exclusively, so this is a teamplay review.

I have one word to say about this map:  DARK!<P>


In some areas, it is used to nice effect--the subway tunnel, for instance, and inside the buildings.  However, I shouldn't have to change my settings to see if someone is on a rooftop I am looking down on! PLEASE PLEASE MAKE A SUBWAY3 WITH A LIGHT ON THE ROOF OF THE SUBWAY EXIT!  I almost like this map--the multiple ways to get to each other's bases, the colored lighting is excellent, and while the music is annoying at times, it doesn't seem to cause lag and it really is a nice touch.  Good level layout--snipers can snipe, shotguns can roam, and machine guns can do either.  If you can only get to someplay one way, that means you can shoot at it from three others--good layout.  However, the level really is ruined by that one rooftop.  One camper gets up there with a silencer (and it always happens) and the game is wrecked.  Even if you know he's there somewhere, it is ABSOLUTELY DARK so the only way to hit is to fire randomly and hope you hit.  Since the camper can see you, you have to be extrememly lucky and hit in your first few shots, because otherwise you are dead.<P>


I love the electric rails.  If your teammates aren't idiots (meaning they don't turn them on when you are on them) it makes the level much more interesting--each respawn point has a path that is more advantageous.

If there were a light on the roof, this map would get a 9 or a 10/10.  However, the map is absolutely wrecked by having a huge, completely unlit area, so it only gets a 3/10.  Harsh?  Play it a few times, you'll see i'm right.
