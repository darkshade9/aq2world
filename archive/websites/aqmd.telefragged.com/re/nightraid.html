  Architecture & Layout score</b> 7/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Layout is very simple but it complements the levels 'style'. If it was more 

  complex or much bigger it would be frustrating to wait in teamplay. Architecture 

  is decent and adds to the gameplay. 

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> 7/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Mixed feelings here. I've probably heard the word 'gl_modulate' more often while 

  playing this map than any other. On the other hand it's actually great fun to 

  be ducking in the 'marsh grass' while tracking an opponent. It's dark dark dark. 

  But that's the point so if you really hate dark maps you need to gl_modulate 

  the sucker or go find something else to play 

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Mostly I think this depends on who is playing. Hardcore campers can quickly 

  make this a boring map. On the other hand when the player mix is just right 

  you have great fast fun. 

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> 10/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  It does what it wanted to do with mood perfectly. 

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  This is pretty much a like/dislike map. It's pretty extreme as to what it tried 

  to do. Could have been a bit better implemented perhaps, but an excellent first 

  try. It's great fun with the right players in teamplay and is still fun in DM. 

  I can't rate it as high as I'd like to since a lot of people will have serious 

  problems with this map. But (for better or worse) it's definitely a must try.

  Architecture & Layout score</b> 4/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The layout is very straightforward - just a strip of land with a hill at one 

  end. The rocks and spotlight thingies give good cover and whatnot, but everything 

  is too close together - you can rush the other team way too fast. Snipers can 

  be easily mowed down by the rushers. Another problem is that the layout is too 

  simplistic, there is only one way to go, and the level can get boring very fast. 

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> 4/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The level looks OK for the most part (good use of lighting effects), but the 

  texturing needs some serious work. All the textures seem to be from baseq2, 

  and the tents look like crap. The spotlights on wheels dont look great either, 

  and they are too close together. 

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> = 6/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  = This level is fun to play, but there are a few problems. If the players don't 

  play stealthy, this level turns into an all out bloodbath as players rush each 

  other right away. Flanking and team tactics? Not really, this level is too small 

  for that. If the players stick to the stealthy approach, the gameplay is just 

  damn cool and original, but that's IF they do. This level runs ok, BUT at the 

  far ends of the level r_speeds can get a little too high (1200+) The high grass 

  is cool. 

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  This is where the level excels: the darkness and silence (if the players don't 

  rush madly) is flat out cool. Turn your music off when you play this. It could 

  have been better is the texturing was done better. 

<p><b>Other:</b><br>

  I'm pretty picky about levels (I think my old levels aren't great), so take 

  this as constructive criticism. This level has a very good and ORIGINAL idea, 

  but it seems like the author did not put enough effort into it. If he spent 

  less time on making the LNL trilogy and more time on this, it could have rocked. 

  But, (no offense to author) it seems like the author made this level in a few 

  days by just slapping things in a room. If you are gonna do a sequel to this, 

  make other areas and make the rocks and cover more spread out. Maybe have a 

  twisty canyon, or hills and ledges up above. Throw in a cave, too. And make 

  some textures. 

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  This level is small and fun - for a very short time. The idea was not implemented 

  right. Its only 400k, and servers run it, so get it. But overall, this level 

  is not great. I'd rather be playing something else.

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  I like the theme of the map, very creative use of the lighting and the swamp 

  ideas is interesting and makes for quite nice uni-level sniping ranges. There 

  are two problems I find. One is the fact that any team starting on the bottom 

  level has an inherent handicap. Many times when I played it in Teamplay (which 

  is just about the only way I play), I found that when my team spawned on the 

  lower level we were massacred. Problem number two I have found is an extreme 

  problem with framerate. When I played it and any amount of heavy action came 

  across my screen the refresh rate ground to a halt, which usually resulted in 

  my quite death.

  Architecture & Layout score</b> 7/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  This map is straight forward and I mean that literally. This is a simulation 

  of a narrow stretch of land with two well lit areas at each extremity. One base 

  sits at the bottom of a steep hill, seeming to give that team a major disadvantage 

  when the round begins. The middle portion of the map is separated by the effect 

  of tall grass. There are portable lights set up through out the map, but this 

  gives way to numerous very dark areas on the entire map. 

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> 7/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The sky is lit with a stars, giving the feeling of a night setting. The textures 

  are nothing new on night raid. I feel a bit cheated by the lack of textures 

  on the tents and lighting units. There could have been more texture added to 

  improve this map. The lighting units are unique and a great idea, but lack detail. 

  This also goes for the tents at top base. Also scattered throughout the map 

  are the Quake boxes, which can be use for adequate cover. 

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 6/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  This map was a great teamplay map. Very tight quarters, not a sniper map, better 

  make use of a shotgun or automatic weapon with a silencer to hid the muzzle 

  flash. It became obvious that each team made their way to the edges of the map, 

  where there was no light for cover. There was continuous muzzle flashes from 

  these areas. It became a good tactic to crouch in the high grass, near the darkened 

  edges to make for effective killing. I don't think everyone knew that the mid 

  ground was high grass and would just run straight through it. Thus making themselves 

  a very easy target. The rounds were not very long making for quick games. The 

  map does not really play well with large teams, it became apparent that 14 people 

  were too many. This just made for easy kills. DM was not played 

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> 9/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Finally a map with excellent use of sounds. There are the chirping of crickets, 

  but not on every portion of the map. As you make your way into the dark, unlit 

  areas the sound of the crickets fade. Very nicely done. Shadows, shadows, shadows! 

  This maps is full of them from the ample light units on the map. But there is 

  also a lack of lighting, making for very dark areas. Areas so dark, you could 

  be next to someone and not even know it. That is until you have a muzzle flash 

  and you are lying sideways on the ground. The lighting effect coupled with the 

  sound really make the map work. 

<p><b>Other:</b><br>

  Another feature unique to night raid is the attempt at high grass on the map. 

  A portion of the middle section and the lower base, both have high grass. Just 

  crouch down and walk and only the upper portion of your body can be seen by 

  the enemy, making it more difficult to be spotted. One minor fault is that the 

  portion of the screen which simulates below the grass is black. If possible 

  this would be another fix in a revised version. 

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  The best overall feeling I've had for a map yet. There are a few minor details 

  which can be resolved in future revisions, but this is a strong map. The map 

  could be a bit larger, possible with some trees or even access to the tents. 

  The map did feel a bit small with 14 people in a team game. But this did make 

  for some great action, as this mod is supposed to do. Another excellent outdoor 

  map. This map is a must for all Action Quake 2 owners who enjoy team.

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Not too bad -- the layout looks pretty and fits its concept. Small, sure, but 

  for TP games of under 4 / team, it works well enough. R_speeds are low, thanks 

  to fairly simple architecture. A nice, original feature is the ingenious tall 

  grass. It's really something to see, and plays as realistically as one could 

  ask. 

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Lighting is definitely both an asset and a liability. While the intense white 

  light adds ambience and realism, it's really way too dark; pitch black is going 

  a bit too far IMHO. I was admonished by one of the mapper's friends on the server 

  to "get a real video card", and perhaps that <u>would</u> help; however, buying 

  a new video card just to suit one finnicky map hardly seems ideal. <br>

  Besides that, the details work well enough, and structures look pretty good 

  despite their simplicity. 

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 3/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  <!--Yeah, this is a tad over 8 sentences...sorry :)--> Let's start with the 

  positives. First of all, this is one of the few maps that supports stealth; 

  no other maps do this as well as Night Raid does. R_speeds are as low as could 

  be hoped for. And the map provides good, fast-paced (yet not insanely so) TP 

  matches. (DM doesn't work too well.) <br>

  And then there's the Big Negative (TM). <br>

  Sadly, Night Raid is far too dark in places. Upping gl_modulate and vid_gamma 

  options helped, but even then it was difficult to see some places (in addition 

  to being butt-ugly). Darkness works well for stealth strategies, but at the 

  risk of sounding like a broken record, The Hunter went too far. A shame, really; 

  with a bit more light in the darkest areas, this could have been one of the 

  best and most innovative maps around. 

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> 10/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Everything works well here. The spotlights contrasted against the shadows are 

  beautiful (and still would be if the shadows weren't black). The crickets add 

  realism and a sense of nervousness to the already inherent tension. Everything 

  looks like it should: a night raid on an enemy camp. Outstanding work here by 

  The Hunter. 

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  When it comes down to it, beauty is only skin deep. With a touch less darkness, 

  Night Raid would have been outstanding; unfortunately, it's not. We can only 

  hope that The Hunter makes revises his map to suit all of us without the means 

  to "get a real video card".

  The layout in this one is pretty good, though a bit simplistic. It is very small, 

  (which isn't really a bad thing) with plenty of boulders and tents for cover. 

  It can often result in 2 second long suicide rushes, however.

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Before I say anything else, realize that I am using a P166 with no 3D card in 

  320x240 resolution, so really there aren't any maps that look great. I didn't 

  find any obvious new textures, just the standard grass and cliff walls. It is 

  appropriately dark, with a few light patches around for contrast. Overall, not 

  a beauty, but it gets the job done. 

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Very fun with up to 10 people in TP, with one exception: of course, the gl_modulate 

  cheaters. It is SO annoying to see one person just sweep through the map shooting 

  everyone, even if it is pitch black where they are standing. It is usually very 

  obvious when people cheat though, so hopefully server ops can ban a few llamas. 

  Ok, cheaters aside, quite nice. It can often lead to tense little showdowns 

  with people looking at each other through the dark, almost all weapons work 

  well, including my favorite combat knives. It is quite possible to be actually 

  kneeling down beside an enemy without him knowing it. :)

  Great setting, the darkness, high grass (great effect BTW) and crickets chirping 

  will bring back memories of games of hide and seek at night in the yard... you 

  know, playing outside? That thing you used to do before you got a computer? 

<p><b>Other:</b><br>

  Hunter, you really need to figure out a way to stump those gl_modulate losers, 

  they can single-handedly suck the fun out of this map like a great big giant 

  sucking thing. 

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  Overall, very nice, small, great for small numbers of people for either DM or 

  TP. Also wonderful for people who like to sneak around tossing knives. :) Well, 

  this is the conclusion for my first review, great job Hunter!

  can hide in the dark, and even under those light posts in the tall grass, remaining

  I love the layout of this map. It's pefect for TP, with an obvious sort of territory 

  for each team. Perhaps the greatest effect of all is the grass in the middle. 

  The grass texture is at about your midsection, and you walk right through it. 

  AMAZINGLY COOL! There are lots of rocks, tents, etc. for cover. If anything 

  could be better there would not clip brushes between the tents to keep people

  The only reason I can't give this a 10 is gl_modulate cheaters. This map is 

  SO not fun when people cheat. I was on karmann's server last night and a lot 

  of people were cheating. But we had a few good rounds on this map and it SO 

  much fun. I used handcannon and slippers (you all know I'm usually an mp5/laser 

  junkie) and it was a LOT of fun. I even found myself putting gl_modulate at 

  0 just to make sure I didn't have an advantage so it would be more fun.

  With the sounds of crickets in various places in the map, a lot of shadows, 

  and a greenish hue reflecting off of the grass, this map is SO cool. I had the 

  piss scared out of me a few times when someone would pop up right in front of 

  me and start shooting. It's a very different kind of game on this map, but it's 

  also SO much fun. 

<p><b>Other:</b><br>

  Like I said, the only drawback is gl_modulate cheaters. Please, people, keep 

  your gl_modulate reasonable (1 or less). After the game last night I msged Dobbs 

  from GENO and the entire A-Team and suggested that a gl_modulate restriction 

  be put into action (ala the already existing fov 90 restriction.) This would 

  seriously help gameplay on a lot of maps, not just this one. 

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  Overall, this map is excellent and a lot of fun to play on. If the gl_modulate

  Architecture & Layout score</b> 2/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Arrrgh its too small, i mean WAY too small. And all the obsticles...thers to 

  many, they hinder gameplay not enhance it. the cicle of things by the trench 

  get in the way and drove me made after about 2 mins. This is way to small for 

  tp and with more than 4 or 5 dm'ers. This map is like LIGHTS....CAMERA.....ACTION.....blah(ded 

  or they r ded). Only one way from end to end...this just sux! Oh and too dark 

  in lotsa areas!! 

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> 5/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Beta...It looks ok but again no really stand out quality textures, lotsa baseq 

  ones let this area of the map down. Also it looks very bland 

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 1/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Not at all fun, one of the must delete maps of the year, gets so frustrating 

  and so monotonus......wheres that recycle bin 

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> 7/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  It does mainly what it probs sett out to achieve...still not great as it for 

  sum reason crete a western feel or waateva 

<p><b>Other:</b><br>

  Ok one day i will give a NICE review but only with a good map, the last two 

  maps (blood and definatley night raid) should not have been released, want a 

  real map....try chris P's litehouse...its actually good. This map is not. A 

  rethink of the map testing needed plus the zipping had the action q2 dir in 

  there...barstard. 

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  Unfortunately another crap map.

<p><b>Overall score:</b> 4/10
