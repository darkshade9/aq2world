<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>Well, it faithfully recreates an airliner. My only problem with the layout is that it seems like you're a toddler. Last time I checked the tops of chairs generally weren't above my eye level.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Looks Rating:</B> 3/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>This map really, really needed new textures. Seats are supposed to look plush, cockpits need a lot more than some Stroggo Q2 textures.
I spawned in the cockpit and it took me a moment to remember it was supposed to be something manufactured by Boeing and not Strogg Industries Inc.

I repeat - this map needs TEXTURES, and fast. It doesn't feel like an airliner at all.

Windows - I thought it would be a good touch to have the windows look out onto the sky, teacher-style. That doesn't mean have an 'outdoor' area, just make the sky the window. There would have been room to insert a great cloud-top texture there. Would have made you feel like you're dozens of thousands of feet in the air instead of in a metal cocoon.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>I cannot comment on this. Only looked around in single player.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 5/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>The radio/turbulence add to the ambiance. What would have been nice for more ambiance were TEXTURES. And sky-windows!</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>One question. The throttle between the pilots' seats - what does it do. And why can you only haul it back. :)

(Maybe it makes the plane stall if you hang around long enough! Woo! That'd be neat. Whole plane pitching forward, eventually it hits the ground and everyone dies (like the apbase) and starts from scratch.)</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>Good textures. This map needs them desperately. With them the cockpit could be made to look authentic and the seats made to look comfortable.
In short, the map could be made to look like an airliner instead of just resembling one.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>Layout was the typical boring as hell airplane model. the lower compartments are nice. although i would like to meantion that the movie Airforce One or Excutive Desicion would make a nice model for another airliner map. just making a suggestion.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Looks Rating:</B> 7/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>A little bright for my tastes, the textures seemed rather nicely done and the lighting was perfect. Excellent work on the cockpit.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Gameplay Rating:</B> 6/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>I took this map first time through one on one with another and it seemed fine although difficult as hell to find people. suprisingly enough. i found that i could have a 300+ ping and still be on par with the guy running the server. So i guess that is one plus to this map. </FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 4/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>Mood wasn't very impressive. There would be some things i would have done differently, although the turbulence is beautiful as well as the intercom. </FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>Two words, CABIN DEPRESSURIZATION!!! THINK ABOUT IT!!! FIRE A GUN AT AN AIRLINE WINDOW EVERYTHING GOES TO HELL!!! IT COULD BE DONE!!! PLEASE PLEASE DO THAT!!! And add some dead hostages around the plane too. And a real bagage compartment. The electrical section was very lame. Try adding overducts and underducts to pop out from (coming down from that roof with guns blazing would be so very entertaining.) is this a christmas list or what?</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>Other than the lovely features that i think would be cool, its a good start to an airline map that could be classic in my opinion. good job, but think about the possibilities in this enviroment, </FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>Well, it looks like a plane I guess. It's got seats, and movies, and that lil lunch counter thing near the front. Cockpit... It's got plane stuff in it.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Looks Rating:</B> 3/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>Crappy. The only nice lookin' things were that the 'windows' were actually plane like windows. The chairs look like some kind of Quake2 metal, and the toilets look like they have rivets in them (ouch). Bah to steel toilets. Looks really bad, needed more comfy, new looking textures. Now here's what really bugs me: All the bathroom signs say TOLIET instead of TOILET.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Gameplay Rating:</B> 7/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>S'ok, fun to crawl around and sneak up on guys. Stealth slippies kinda good here, and there's nothing to fall off of that will prove fatal. Not alota room to move about, but enough to not be constantly in stabbing range of whoever you might be fighting.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 9/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>hehe, bonous points on the turbulence ;)
The intercom's not bad either. Coulda used some in flight music, or maybe interactive movie headphones (though it'd be trivial and annoying)</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>The only action plane I can think of right now is that plane in Executive Decision where all the guys are sneakin' about trying to stop the terrorists. They capped the badguys might fast though, this plane's not that easy to get capped in if you're paying attention, but it's still not made for long long long fights eh?</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>Eh, keep action on the ground. It's not bad, but the turbulence gets annoying sometimes, and it's really dark in places (need a flashlight). It's not bad, but it's not gonna be a favorite of mine anytime soon.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Architecture Rating:</B> 8/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>The layout was very intresting. How often do you actually get to fight inside of an airliner. The problem with it though is that the scale seemed off. Almost as if you where a giant inside a toy airliner. Also do to the nature of the map combat was very quick and very blood [a bit on the boring side].</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Looks Rating:</B> 5/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>After the initial shock of "Wow its an airliner!" it just kind of went downhill from there. Nothing seemed new, nothing really jumped out at me. It was just a big tube of its side.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Gameplay Rating:</B> 2/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>The map really fell on its face in this department. I was playing CTB on this map and people just left the server. The combat was very bland. Team A runs into Team B and bang bang, everyons dead. There was not much sneaking around. Also throw in a hand grenade and your going to kill at least half the other team [ack!].</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 4/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>The only reason I give this map a 4 is that there seemed to turblance ever once an awhile, which in turn got very annoying very quickly. The lighting was not very intresting at all. The underside of the airliner was a bit more intresting, but still it looked very stock.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Other Comments:</B><BR></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>After the inital shock of seeing this map I feel that its not really going to catch on. the map is intresting, and I commend the author on his fine work, but it doesn't lend itself to deathmatch or teamplay.</FONT><P>
