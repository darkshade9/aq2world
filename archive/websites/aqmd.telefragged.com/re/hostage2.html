<b>Review:</b><br>

 One of the orginal maps in AQ2, hostage is by far the most even of the maps. With a huge space divided up into basically two rooms, one light and one dark, any Action Q2 player finds themself at home on this level. A review of weapon effectiveness,

<p>

Knife-I would'nt recommend using that here...too many open areas, with lots of ammo lying around you will be an easy target. Though it would be fun to whack some camper in the limo with it. :-)

<p>

Pistol-Well, i wouldn't say this is bad, but with an assortment of weapons you're gonna find yourself outgunned if you just run around with a Mk 23.

<p>Shotgun-My fave close weapon. With the way the boxes are, you find yourself just running into people without notice, and this dispatches them nicely and quickly

<p>

HandCannon-I do not find this weapon useful. At all, in any level. It is basically worthless outside 15 yards, but if you like being up close and personal, go for it!

<p>Mp5-Hehe. This weapon rules on this level. With plenty of ammo, and by staying in the bright side of the level, you can seriouly kick some A**!

<p>m4-if you have a bandolier, and fill this up with ammo, you will find killing is so much mor e fun. But the fact without the extra ammo you only have 40 quick rounds to use in a level where you're gonna need more. With so many places to avoid fire, you will find yourself wasting ammo on walls instead of flesh. But it's still my favorite weapon, gotta love that sound! Bruhahahaha!

<p>

Spiper Rife-If i feel like sitting back with my mouse and relaxing, i find no better way to do so then with the wonder SIG-somethingorother sniper rifle. 1st of all, the fact that this is the only weap i will use mouse for is nice...(i live in the past, but i still kick ass without the allmighty mouse) i can just sit ina corner, lean back, and wait for my target to come into view. With the many sniper pos in the dark side of the level, it makes for a fun time. If you like entertainment instead of frags..take this puupy out for a ride.

<b>Review:</b><br>

My all time favorite map and a classic to all Action players. This map has it all, great dark sniping spots and semi wide open gun fights. 

<p>

It consists of 2 big warehouse type rooms that are connected by doors it gives u a nice John Woo feeling in the stomach =)

<p>

I personally love the great contrast that the maker put into this map, one room has wide open sniping spots and gunfights were u can go silly with the MP5, by the way you gotta love the colored lighting under the limmo. While the other room has closed little allyes where the shotgun and grenade rule.

<p>

 You can go from room to room and experience two types of map gameplay, and both rooms are covered with great catwalk platforms were u can retreat from all the madness and enjoy a little sniping. The map also has great r_speeds and looks great in GL this is a classic map that im sure everyone loves.

<b>Review:</b><br>

  For those of you who want to know what this map is like as far as setting and such goes, I suggest you read the other reviews for a taste. Here I intend to deal with how the level plays - is it worth the download?

<p>

     This was the first map I ever played, and I still think that as far as on-your-toes action is concerned it holds its own against the best of them. Although not as good as 'Locknload' for groups, this map really caters for the duel to the death 1 on 1 encounters. Weapon placement is thoughtful, with grabbing them leaving the player either hopelessly exposed, as with the M4, or miles away from a useful position, as with the sniper rifle. You have to leave yourself vulnerable for ammo as well, and this results in far more fluid play - no-one can sit still for long. Also, its nice to see a level where the pistol is still a vital weapon - the semi-automatic setting is second to none, not even the sniper rifle, for dropping those who choose the shadows at the top of both rooms to lurk in. Snipers really have to move after a kill - camping is not feasible, for if your general location is known, the series of light strips will always illuminate you from one angle or another. The shotgun is great at ground level, scaring the bejesus out of most who encounter its lethal close range delivery. The three rooms suspended above the floor of the bright warehouse are especially lethal for those who dare to take a commanding position there, and the good fields of fire are countered by their brightness and the subsequent need to move more erratically than a headless chicken with an inner ear problem. Anything less and you are asking for an express delivery of hot lead, courtesy of just about anywhere.

<p>

     While this level generally plays well though, there are problems. The secondary warehouse with the limo becomes somewhat deserted, with all the action in the other, brighter area. The lifts are slower than a Three Toed Sloth in a mortuary, and players using them might as well have a big sign saying 'Here I am - Shoot me NOW!'. This leads to most of the action occuring on the other side of the bright warehouse, with the bottleneck of the top of the ramp providing an interesting quandry. Aside from these minor gripes, though, the level plays excellently, with the right textures and lighting working well to create a brilliant atmosphere. Me and my brother played this level 1 on 1 last night, first to 100 frags, and the final score - 100 all! I'll get him next time...

<b>Review:</b><br>

There's not much else to be said about this map that hasn't already been said:  It is a fun, rockin' map that ranks as one of my faves of all the Action Quake maps.  However, with the version .99 out and teamplay available, this map needs another look, this time from the teamplay standpoint.<p>

    Put bluntly, teamplay on this map is AWESOME.  co-ordination becomes critical in making sure no one gets blindsided, as there are so many chances to have your entire team flanked and torn apart.  The mp5 is incredible here, and good teamwork is almost always rewarded with victory.  This is one map where Real Life(TM) tactics(overlapping fields of fire, covering doors, working as a team) will pay off BIG TIME.  So, in short, this is still a great map and very worthy of your time!
