<b>Review:</b><br>

Hello again. Im back with my 3rd review so far (by the way, i think this review scheme is good, and whoever thought of actually letting the players review is awesome). Anyway, on to the review. My map of choice this time is bldg17, aka Building 17, by Creepy. This is one of my favorite AQ2 maps.

<br>

The layout of this map is very simple, and it's perfect. Nobody said that you had to make a complex or complicated design in order for your map to be good. This map is laid out similar to a CTF level.This is because there are 2 bases, which are indentical (except one is darker than the other......?), and a neutral territory. Great for teamplay! The fighting seems to be balanced too. I've had just about equal action in the 2 buildings, outside, and on the rooftops.

<br>

The weapons layout is ok too. The MP5 is outside, between bases, the sniper rifle is at the bottom of a ladder leading to the roof, etc. And the placement of the grenades (fav weapon) allows me to do the old "throw the grenade off the legde and see who blows up!"(fav strategy=-).

<br>

All in all, this is one of the best AQ2 maps around. Grab this as soon as possible (and Creepy, get working on another map=-).

Later
