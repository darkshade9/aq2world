This map almost made my servers map list. The outside area with the dry dam is really cool. The rest of it is useless.
Useless for teamplay at least. Everyone hates waiting for the last players to find and kill each other. If the mine section of this map was cut out, and maybe a few more interesting structures placed outside, this map would really be fun.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR> Like I said before, the dry dam part looks nice. There is that block-brick building that looks way out of place. Enough so, that you notice it right away and think to yourself, "that does not look right" </FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR> The fact that it takes so long to find someone in teamplay makes this map not a good choice.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>The map is made well. This map is quite simple but lot of killing space. Mine is realistic and great. Tables and doors are right size..
but there shoult be more sniping spots.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>there could be more sound effects for the mood..
but the sky makes a nice mood</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>this map is quite good but it could be better with more effects 
and more light (if you play with GL_modulate 10 it´s too bright and if
you play with GL_modulate 0 it's too dark then.!</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>it's great that map author has done many of his own textures for this map.
Keep on going AretsaM!!
but use more effects.</FONT><P>
