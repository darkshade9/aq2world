  <font color="#FFFFFF"><b><u>REVIEW</u><br>

  Architecture & Layout score</b> 7/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  This is your typical city map, built within a city block. There are buildings 

  around the edge of the map and a small inaccessible building in the center, 

  connected by a covered walkway. Most of the buildings allow roof access, but 

  only three of the building have interior rooms. There does seem to be some difficulty 

  getting down to the street level from some of the buildings. The is a jump required 

  onto the brick building with the 'Coke' sign, so you can make your way down 

  the building under construction. The line of fire provides unlimited gaming 

  action for both snipers and shotgun or MP4/machinegun players. The sniper could 

  be at an advantage if holed up in the building where the sniper round regenerate, 

  as it is tough to get a kill when the wall provides cover. After all, there 

  is only one way in and out. This map is well balanced allowing for manageable 

  game play. Weapon layout is scattered throughout the city, making it well balanced. 

  </font>

</font> 

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>How It Looks score</b> 6/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The alignment of the background cityscape adds a touch of color to the otherwise 

  brown, bland map. If there were additional stars in the sky, this too could 

  have given urban more dusk or early evening feeling. Overall, the theme of the 

  map works.There is nothing overly spectacular about urban. Gerbil! did take 

  the time to use a few different prefab textures on the buildings, giving a bit 

  of randomness to the map. But these textures still become a bit over used. But, 

  nonetheless, this is a city and most buildings seems to resemble the next. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  I find this map to be an excellent map to play and have experienced both teamplay 

  and DM on urban. There are a few areas which snipers seem to covet, like the 

  shielded area near the parking garage, accessed by jumping over to the grey 

  building. Also for those who dare to access the roof of the parking garage, 

  BEWARE. This can become a prime location to be picked off from. I know, because 

  I love this spot. A note to the sniper, if no one is covering your back, your 

  opponent could easily climb the building sneak up behind you. For those who 

  like to get into blaring gun fights, you are in luck. The is enough area where 

  you are usually covered from being shot at. An excellent for teamplay, except 

  for one respwn spot. That being the spot on top of the center building. There 

  is only a single way down, by jumping onto the roof of the walkway and dropping 

  through the hole in the roof. A door and some stairs leading into the small 

  enclosed room would have made for even better team action. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Ambiance score</b> 4/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  There was no use of sounds, unless you want to consider all the times a player 

  attempts the jump over to the brick building with the 'Coke' sign on top. If 

  you misjudge, there is a yell, followed by a splat. Outside of that, this is 

  a quiet map. I do think some sound would have been out of place if used. There 

  are not really any dark areas on the map, but the author did use lighting on 

  both the streets and on the corridor for effect. Looks a bit false shinning 

  on the streets, maybe because I don't think it is dark enough, but it does help 

  out this map. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Other:</b><br>

  Still one of the most popular and well designed maps around. Its simplicity 

  makes it a map which will stand the test of time. The map does have great play 

  characteristics, but there is potential for even a better urban map. This has 

  been accomplished in the follow up maps, urban2 and urban3. A few parked cars 

  or trucks would have helped for cover when running through the empty streets. 

  </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  Great gameplay and action all the time on this map. Not too big for a few players, 

  but large enough for a good team match. This is worth the download, check it 

  out! </font>

  Well, I noticed there aren't any reviews for this map, so I figured I'd start 

  the ball rolling. Ok, I guess I better stick t the format that so many other 

  reviews use, this is my first review and feel free to e-mail me (I barely get 

  any flames). Well I downloaded Urban yesterday and started playing it against 

  my borther. I can't say that the idea is original with actcity and about three 

  more city levels, but this level isn't too bad for deathmatch (teamplay I have 

  no idea). The textures aren't that amazing but with the amount of buildings 

  you can get on top of, it is a good sniper's level. I found one very large flaw 

  with the level, there is barely any ammo (obviously it was set up for TP not 

  DM). Well, back to the sniping bit, it is good for the snipers but not for the 

  snipies. I can't say it is the best map ever but it doesn't suck too much. You 

  can download it, but I don't think too may servers are going to run it because 

  it just isn't that original or good. </font>

<p> <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Review:</b><br>

  Hey all you good good people, Rookie here to tell you that this map RAWKS!!!! 

  While release was tentitive (bad r_speeds being the reason) this map is all 

  about gameplay, making it one of the best maps ever. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Gerbil takes the common urban idea and truly explores 

  all the possibilties of Urban warfare. Everything from roof top chases to street 

  wars to building blowouts, this map takes the city theme and truly explores 

  it. The attention to detal is amazing, using beatiful textures, well crafted 

  buildings and enough secrets to make you explore the level a little. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Layout is a bit tricky to describe. Theres a few building, 

  two attched by a "catwalk". One "under contruction" building, numerous roof 

  tops and a nice sniper area behind a billboard. The map features lost of little 

  passageways, a plus for teamplay. There's enough cover, but it's still open 

  enough to allow freedom of movement. There isn't any real "advantage spot" so 

  teamplay is usally fair. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> DM is fun on this map. The ammo and weapon placement 

  are great. The size of the level is perfect and it's just a blast. But this 

  map truly shines on teamplay. Multiple paths, surprise spots, high ground, all 

  the things needed for a good team map are definitely in this map. I can't say 

  too many good things about it. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Gripes: Well r_speed are high (grr... buy a 3D card 

  and use GL damnit!) </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Overall this map is excellent, this map is truly a great 

  map and it couldn't have come at a better time (with the recent flood of mediocre 

  maps.) I'll have to shake the hand of whoever leaked this map to force Cliffe 

  to put it up, everyone should have a chance to play this one. <br>

<p> <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Review:</b><br>

  This looked pretty damn cool on first impressions, the street lamp spot lighting 

  is very nice, the texture use and kerbs are nice. The buildings all look too 

  blan to me; first there is no furniture anywhere and most buildings just usethat 

  black window texture from Duke3D. I wasn't playing on a server but from what 

  i could see the map would run fast but teamplay would not be a favorite because 

  there are many ways from one side to the other. The coloured lighting is excellent 

  as i have never seen that colour before :) There are plenty of sniping spots 

  (then again i snipe on the floor with my back to a wall...), the M4 is in a 

  good position up high and it just looks quite nice. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> If it had difference in texture use throughout the level 

  like blockwar and had more detail (like blockwar..) and maybe slightly more 

  cut off from one side to the other (like...actcity2) then it would be a classic 

  in my books. Pretty good for DM though. <br>

  -Computer </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><nr hoshade> </font>

<p> <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Review:</b><br>

  This map requires little introduction. If you crave the speed, and ferocity 

  of 'Actcity2,' but yearn for a larger playing field and more/better sniping 

  locations, this map is for YOU. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Structure and Design: This is probably one of the better 

  map layouts most players will face. In its crudest view, 'Action in da city.' 

  or 'Urban' (I will refer to the map as the latter from now on) is designed around 

  a sort of 4x3 grid, with twelve or so major "zones" where battle may ensue. 

  The buildings themselves are not exactly realistic in nature, however a fairly 

  good attempt was made to mask that with good placement. It's kind of disappointing 

  to see that you can usually enter only a portion of a building, and the rest 

  is just one big, fat brush. If anything gains from this, however, it's the fact 

  that the level appears to be large, but is in fact quite small. It's actually 

  not hard to find people in a four player game. I noticed a couple prefabs here 

  and there (ie. the lamp posts) but these were implemented much more convincingly 

  than many other maps and are actually appropriate. Great design and structure 

  for the map, though it's realism takes a mediocre hit because of missing level 

  detail and questionable building purposes. [8.5/10] </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Aesthetics: Again, generally well done, but I think 

  some attention to the colour and texture placement should be considered. Because 

  these are low-brush buildings, texture repetitive will be made a lot. It is 

  a bit disappointing to see 8-floor buildings that are slapped on with the same 

  texture all the way up. Something could have been done here, though I have a 

  feeling it would have churned up the higher-than-normal r_speeds (see later) 

  to a greater peak. Textures were mostly borrowed by others, but the greatest 

  problem lies with colour. It's another brown and grey level! These maps remind 

  me of some post-nuclear strike or something, because of their lack of city vibrance. 

  As a last bit, I thought the lighting of this level was mediocre, in the sense 

  that little attempt was made to contrast walls like real life. There are light 

  entities placed in alleys and what-not for no real purpose and add round light 

  spots to places where they shouldn't be. Gameplay doesn't really suffer, but 

  visual quality does. [7.5/10] </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Weapons: Good weapon placement, though the ammo placement 

  is unbalanced. The M4 is placed out of the way in a useless location (it will 

  never be used where it's found) which is good, as it promotes movement and less 

  tent-pitching. However, I think the most questionable part is behind a billboard 

  where 2 MP5 clips are located. Any MP5er will want to just pitch-tent there 

  and kill everybody below. There is good cover, and only a sniper can take that 

  person down easily (assuming he/she doesn't get nailed by a spray of bullets 

  first). Of course, if you're teamplaying this map none of this applies. :) [8.5/10] 

  </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Gameplay: Now this is where the level really shines. 

  I played this map with 3 other friends and although it is a bit on the "CPU-intensive 

  side" (as quoted from the MapDepot page) it is still very, very good. You don't 

  get lost like 'Blockwar' (which I still consider a benchmark map), yet it's 

  a non-fragfest level. That's the beauty of it. TP Rounds will take a reasonable 

  amount of time (slower than 'ActCity2,' faster than 'Blockwar') and DM will 

  have a good cycle of "kill, bandage, suspense, kill, etc." :) R_Speeds are a 

  bit high for your software user like myself, and you will often lose a lot of 

  polys when you look from a rooftop. 3D Accelerators should have no trouble. 

  Even though the map looks messed from high areas w/ SW rendering, I still give 

  it a perfect mark for gameplay. [10/10] </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Miscellaneous: Just a comment: the author did not create 

  the zip perfectly- it unzips the map into the \Quake2\Action directory (as opposed 

  to \Quake2\Action\Maps). Plus, the text file says urbanaq1.txt, which may mislead 

  you into thinking that's what the map name is supposed to be. A little hassle 

  that is worth dealing with for the map. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Overall: Gameplay is what makes most maps great, and 

  this one proves just that. The textures and realism are not superstar quality, 

  but nonetheless something most people can set aside when really into a game. 

  A well done map- I would love to get more action on this map (no pun intended 

  and don't take it as some sexual innuendo :). [8.5/10] </font>

<p> <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Review:</b><br>

  OK. I think I'll start by stating relationships. I recently joined Smoking Mirror 

  Productions (smp.telefragged.com), as did Gerbil!, so I suppose there is a connection. 

  He also sent me a preview of the map 2 days before release, which was essentially 

  the same as the final. Of course, this won't affect my objectivity. I will be 

  writing this review as a mapper, in my usual in-depth style (as the mappers 

  I have contacted personally will know). </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> The map, for those that haven't tried it yet, is a small 

  city map, with the same rough appearance as such classics as Mancis Freeway 

  and Blockwar, although I can see influences ranging from the SiN deathmatch 

  level Sin City to the Teamfortress maps Town2 and Town4. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> The city includes a kind of parking area that isn't 

  fully built yet, streets, alleys and some dangerous places to climb. The first 

  thing that leaps into mind on startup is the problem with the zip. Not only 

  does the map extract to the base directory, not maps/, but a sound is missing 

  (not in the zip at all). </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> The map is fairly nice looking from my perspective, 

  although there are flaws (in my opinion). The streetlights are simply light 

  entities with the info_null on the ground and a larger than normal _cone value 

  (I guess around 40). This gives them a pretty rough, delineated edge; I think 

  putting in a surface light either instead of or in addition to the spotlight 

  would have helped. Some of the texturing could have been better; for example, 

  the sewer grates on the ground are like chicken wire not a metal grille, and 

  I note that an awful lot of textures have been borrowed (I don't mind myself, 

  but I'm not so sure about other mappers/texturers). It gives you a chance to 

  play "What's That Texture" though :) </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> There are quite a few nicely made things though; the 

  streetlights look nice, and the parking area, although totally unsafe (both 

  in the lack of some supports and also the "ramp of doom" deathtrap), looks appealing. 

  Weapon placement is fairly good, though I note that there isn't that much ammo 

  available; hopefully this means that a more stealthy style of play will become 

  useful. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> A major gripe I have with this level is the one-way 

  system. By this I mean that much of the level is only accessible through the 

  use of ladders; you can only go up. Bad thing - I can imagine this frustrating 

  many players. "[RD] Holy Goat's happy thought wasn't good enough" anyone? Stairs 

  are much better in my opinion. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> The great variety of heights is a good thing though; 

  sniping should be fun on this map, though we shall see if it dethrones Cliff 

  on this count. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The framerates are very good for most of the map; at 

  most they go into the high hundreds/very low 1000s at the very highest point 

  of the level, which will be fine for snipers. Commendations on that area. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Of course, I am a very cynical person, and a mapper, 

  so I do like to pick up on the little details of a level. In no way construe 

  that I hate this map; the level on the whole is a very good effort; well made, 

  clean and fun to play. I recommend you all to get it immediately, although for 

  his next effort I recommend Gerbil! to take more note of scaling (use insanes 

  for this) and also accessibility. And always to check his zips. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I hope you enjoyed this review, and maybe learned something 

  from it; who knows. </font>

  Now I know Gerbil and I have been talking to him throughout the his mapmaking 

  process. At one time he had let me try it out (imcomplete with no weapons). 

  Even then I could see the potential. What can I say? This map is great. And 

  it is my favorite. The setup is quite unique with a bunch of skyscrapers and 

  in the middle a street. Snipers rule on this map--- but with some tactics even 

  they go down easy. The spawn points are great, giving some immediate cover, 

  making this map balenced nicely. No particular spawn point has any particular 

  advantage over another. There are many snipe points on the skyscrapers...and 

  on the bridge to combat the ones in the buildings. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Now I only played this map in teamplay-- I am not sure 

  what it would be like DM. But I must say this map was made for teamplay. As 

  a teamplay stand point I give it 9/10. It is simply the best AQ2 map for teamplay. 

  I would rather play this map than any other. Go try it and see what I mean!

  OK, well I don't profess to know everything about map-making. I do know that 

  I am a quaker and I like this map. I love the layout, It reminds me of a mix 

  of Action City and Block War. Its got that great setting of a city that really 

  lets you get into a mod like action quake. I haven't played it on DM but in 

  Team Play its awesome. For those of you who like to snipe from sky scrapers 

  you are in luck and for you automatic weapons users there are some great street 

  brawls with alleys that provide excellent escape for a quick reload or bandage. 

  You can get into some interesting situations in this. You know the ones that 

  you tell your friends about later. I've heard some ranting about lag on this 

  map but I haven't seen anyone leave because of it. I have a friend who loves 

  this map and software renders. Anyway that's about all I have to say but in 

  short this map kicks ass. Congrats Gerbil! </font>

<p> <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Review:</b><br>

  Well, someone has to say it. I don't like this map. While it is excellent for 

  deathmatch (I believe a previous reviewer mentioned stealth being a useful thing, 

  which is very kewl), I play primarily teamplay. There, this map has problems. 

  The biggest need in teamplay is mobility--can you or your teammates move to 

  support positions? Even if you snipe, it is important that those M4 and shotgun 

  wielding teammates be able to move to a position to watch your flanks. This 

  is especially true on this map, with the multitude of ways for approaches to 

  be made. However, a couple of places can't be left, even in the no-damage time 

  given at the start of a round. This occurs because of the use of ladders at 

  bad locations. What this means is when you spawn up there, the other team can 

  surround you and start the frag-fest. And nobody on your team can do anything 

  to stop them from moving to their positions short of some heroic and ammo-wasting 

  shot attempts. The map is a good attempt, and most of it seems well done (as 

  other reviews have said, good framerates, decent lighting, good weapon locations), 

  however, this should be considered a deathmatch map. The inability to spread 

  out and find more advantageous positions from oft-used spawn points kills teamplay. 

  </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Additionally, if you don't like team sniper duels, this 

  map should be avoided. I like wide open spaces combined with narrow, twisty 

  hallways, but when the other team has 3-5 snipers, running from building to 

  building on this map becomes a VERY risky situation. It is too likely that one 

  of them will snag a lucky shot no matter how erratic your movement. If the map 

  had some cover in the streets (a truck, something to break the bare landscape--think 

  the streets in subway2), it would be much more playable. If you for some reason 

  LIKE both teams being completely made up of snipers, why are you here? You already 

  have the perfect map--Desert Bases. *shudder* </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> This is almost a great map, but I'm sticking to Blockwar. 

  I hope Gerbil! tries again, though--this shows some ability. <br>

  This is one of the finest Teamplay maps ever!!! It's simplistic city layout 

  allows the fights to begin within a couple of minutes. There are many team starting 

  points that put you into different types of situations. You may start on a rooftop, 

  or you may start down on the ground. One thing I don't like about this map is 

  it fuels camping. Dark rooms for snipers, and high locations for snipers all 

  cause people to camp out. I once had my whole team whiped out because they all 

  camped out in a room, and a member of the opposite team sneaked in with the 

  slippers and my team died because they were all bunched in this little room. 

  Other then that, you'll be envolved in rushing gun fights on rooftops, streets, 

  and other. <br>

  that would have helped a lot. This isn't Unreal, Q2's ability to reduce the 

  poly count isn't that great. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Structure: Everything feels thick. I guess it's normal 

  but that door doesn't need to be 8 texels thick. Everything though feels kind 

  of simple. Stairs are no different. Those are 16 texels thick on there own, 

  that's about 1/4 the size of the player. Now when was the last time you had 

  to climb a set of stairs that was about a 1.5 feet high? Ladders, come on. I 

  know the eight sided thing looks nice but we can't necessarily spare the r_speeds 

  here now can we? A simple 4 texel thick, square ladder would have achieved the 

  same effect without the higher poly count. Are your sidewalks like that? I know 

  mine aren't. Mine aren't even that high. I do like the street lights though. 

  That's pretty much the only thing I liked. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Weapon placement: I felt it was too easy to get the 

  M4. You should have atleast made it a little challenging to get it. I never 

  did find the shotgun though. Maybe I didn't look hard enough. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Gameplay: Obviously this is a snipe fest. No doubt about 

  it. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> That's it, I'm happy now. :) </font>

  Okay, now if you read my review on Armyterr, you'd think I'd like an open map 

  like this, because I bashed on armyterr for being too boxed in. Well I don't 

  like this map either because it is far to open to play on. I don't like open 

  maps for one reason, and that is balance you simply can't be very successful 

  in teamplay using a handcannon, nearly all weapons need to have range on this 

  level to be good. Yah you may be able to sneak up on an occsional sniper, but 

  this map is way too unbalanced to be fun. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Layout and Design -3/10- The ideas are good, but most 

  have already been used, like the parking garage deal, and the signs which in 

  my mind and others Action + Cartoon Graphics = Sucks. Mapmakers need to use 

  their own ideas, instead of making essentially a different version of another 

  map. This map is essentially like actcity2, but more wide open. I don't like 

  an entire map to be open, and ecspecially one of this size. I really, really 

  dislike maps that have all of these great buildings, that you can't get into, 

  except for a couple of inside sniper areas. There needs to be more inside to 

  this level, and less outside. Basically if you are a camping sniper, then this 

  map is for you, I'm not really a sniper so I dislike this map greatly. Not enough 

  cover is in this level. It's hard to find a spot where you don't need to watch 

  to both sides of yourself also. Stop making box maps, you can do something like 

  chriscity, where it's less of a box and more of a curve type of thing </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Textures -5/10- Low grade for one simple reason, and 

  that's all of the window textures, directly from Duke 3d. To me this is a cheap 

  way of decorating an entire building without a lot of thought. Also the action 

  quake signs and such, please don't do this in the future we don't want to see 

  it and it doesn't fit in any level. Nothing makes me dislike textures more than 

  a few stupid signs. One question to mapmakers is why you put action signs in 

  the map? Really stupid to do and please DON'T DO IT. The textures are boring, 

  and don't add to this map in any significant way. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Teamplayability -3/10- Way too many people take up sniping 

  on this map, which makes it ultimately a boring map. What else can I say, but 

  that it's too unbalanced towards one weapon to even be fun. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> How it ran -7/10- It runs great even though it's a big 

  level. Need I say more? </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Overall -4/10- This map is unoriginal, there are too 

  many city maps, so mapmakers expand to new horizons, such as forest maps, or 

  western style maps, or maybe even one of an airplane or a courthouse anything 

  but another cityscape. Good try, but if someone else makes another map of a 

  city, I'll scream. -- Crodge </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> P.S. I know I bash lots of maps, but I praise others 

  too, if I'm not impressed by a map, I'm going to give it a beat down. Thanks 

  for reading :) </font>

  My first review...I'm so nervous... </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> At first I didn't like this map, mostly because my brains 

  were being sprayed against the walls every 10 seconds by snipers. However, I 

  feel this is probably the best team play map I've seen yet, with something for 

  everyone. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Obviously, this is a great sniper map and some of the 

  highest individual scores I've seen in a 20-minute cycle were by snipes. There 

  are plenty of elevated positions on the buildings, and a lot of strategy for 

  snipers revolving around which positions can be seen from which positions. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> However, theres plenty of fun for run 'n gun types as 

  well, especially in team play. It is, of course, one of the funnest things in 

  Action Quake to walk up behind a guy that has his eye glued to his sniper 'scope 

  and re-align his frontal lobes for him. I've had clean sweeps of 3-4 snipers 

  on top of the largest building - if you can get up the ladders of course. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> One of the few bad things about this map is the waiting...especially 

  if you get into a 1 on 1 or 2 on 2 situaation and everyone is camp-sniping. 

  We've had a few rounds that were mostly over in 2 minutes go the full 6 and 

  time out because of a couple of lame campers. My suggestion is to berate them, 

  or even switch teams and kill them repeatedly if necessary to get the point 

  across. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> One Urban-specific tactic is the swan-dive of death: 

  The end of a round, you have a 2 on 1 advantage and the 1 guy is below you: 

  pull out your pistol and swan dive past his position. Make sure you get him; 

  it's embarrasing if you miss and splat but you're a hero if you kill him and 

  splat. It's actually and easy shot too if you think about it. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Well thats my review of Urban. What? You want scores 

  for lighting? Go look for yourself :P </font>
