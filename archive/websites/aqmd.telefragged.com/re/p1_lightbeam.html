<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>Overall Layout is one of the main strengths of this map. Its has a certain flow that means despite its size its playable down to a small number of people. 2v2 being lowest for fast rounds.
Every room has a range of entrances and exits and in most circumstances everyone has options rather than being forced into a certain course of action. It has obvious sniping points with many exits. The DM weapons are nicely distributed and the lack of dead ends means if your good you can survive for ages making it a real fun map when u have enough people.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Looks Rating:</B> 9/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>The looks arent super stunning. They are very nice and nothing looks wrong but its just not quite professional looking. I note its not QUITE but very damn nearly. The lighthouse doesnt quite have the right shape but everything else is perfect. The one thing everyone mentions is the kick ass PC's and textures and they reqally are kick ass. Overall uts quiet a light map but with people cheating using gl_mod etc this means no-one has an advantage and if doesnt spoil the abience.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Gameplay Rating:</B> 10/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>The architecture lends itself to DM play and the whole map has a circle feel not unlike army terror but with shortcuts that mean u can cut across the main loop. This means people find each other easily adn rounds are often action packed despite its size. Snipers will love the roofs and light house which can be attacked from all over but have many routes down so arent death traps, AutoJunkies will love the speed of the map and popping up from drains and vents and through roofs rocks, and the handcannon and shotgun people will love the tight constricting corridors.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 9/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>Ohh ambience. Boy has P gone to town with the sounds. The seagulls that cry from the rooftops and the wind that whistles past. These arent just ear candy but functional too. Sniping from roofs means u lose the ability to hear footsteps to counter the height advantage. And the water has water sounds and the humm of the PCs is good as well but none of it detracts from playing it either.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>The water serves as an instant escape route from anywhere high but means u have to swim to safety making u a slow target. The rooftop sounds mean u cant hear footsteps so that snipers dont have a huge advantage. Its these touches that make this map a little bit special and although its good without them when u realise these things u realise how exceellent this map is. As a side note one bad thing (IMO) is the lack of unintended routes. Many maps have little tricks to learn but most of the ones in P's map are intentional which kinda makes me feel like I am being forced to play how he wants me too.
</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>There are lots of very subtle things that make this map excellent. And the tight corridors push people into rooms. Everywhere has options as I said before and when u know the map your never dead till you hit the floor. This is the best AQ2 map so far (IMO) try it!</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>The map is done well. That lighthouse is great. There are couple of sniping spots in the outside. The house is great too but those tables and chairs are too big. And those computers are best! </FONT><P>
