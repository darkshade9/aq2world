<p><b><u>REVIEW</u><br>

  Architecture & Layout score</b> 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  This map is really well laid out, it's basicly four train cars running along 

  a tunnel. This simple idea works so well, especially for teamplay where someone 

  running along the top of the train can get past people and sneak up behind them. 

  You gotta watch your back and use sound. There is a real feeling of movement 

  on this map, it's really exhilirating. </p>

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The look on this map really grows on you. At first I thought the indoor textures 

  were too bright, but they contrast with the outside ones which are much duller. 

  I love the tunnel wall textures as well, just right for the moving feel. The 

  darkness above the train is great as well, you catch glimpses of people running 

  along. 

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 10/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  This is were the map scores really high - it's such fun to play! The close range 

  combat that occurs is short, brutal, and gory. I love it! You can use all of 

  the weapons and succeed (yes, even the sniper rifle), and I haven't decided 

  which is best. At first the handcannon was good, but the shotgun gave you more 

  flexiblily. On the other hand, I just won a game with the M4.... 

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> 9/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Another high score, the mood of this map is great - I mean, a moving train. 

  It's just like the movies! Kinda reminds me of mission impossible (all we need 

  is a helicopter). The sound of the train really adds to this, it's spot on. 

  You can almost feel the wind in your face when you run along the top! There's 

  huge room for making a movie on this map. 

<p><b>Other:</b><br>

  I'd like you to note this is my first review, mainly because this map enspired 

  me to do it. Otherwise, I think I've said all I need to. 

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  Basicly, this map is a blast. It's superb fun, and everyone should try it.

<p><b><u>REVIEW</u></b></p>

<p><b>Architecture & Layout score</b> = 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Layout for this map is very good. The map seems to have VERY good r-speeds. 

  (I run a p200 w/32 meg voodoo banshee 16 meg video) and there was no point while 

  runnin around, that the map had any slowdowns.. Great job bunnyx!! Basically 

  you're on a moving train with a few cars. The sense of movement is VERY good. 

  one of the highlights of this map. I must comment though about weapon placement. 

  Folks looking for an easy grab of the M4 are going to be unpleasantly suprised. 

  It's located at the front of the train on the exterior. Once you have the M4, 

  returning back to the train is extremely difficult as no ladder is available, 

  but there is a very small catwalk on either side of the train Good luck making 

  it back though. </p>

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> = 8/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Textures are well done, especially the tunnel texture that the train is passing 

  through. When I first saw this map yesterday (Dec 29) if I wasn't so map-jaded, 

  I would have sworn I heard a gasp escape from with me when I first fell off 

  the train. hehehe lighting on this map is also well done.. I didn't try it in 

  software mode, but I would imagine it's very good in sw also. 

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> = 7/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br>

  This map is definitly DM all the way. If used on a teamplay server I believe 

  the matches would be over quickly ala cliff2 or jungle which is a good thing. 

  I don't think any of us like sittin waiting for the last dude to drop.. (but 

  at least when the matches are long, we DO get to clean up our puter desks LOL) 

  runnin on top of this moving train is quite exhilerating. 

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> = 9/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The sheer feeling of movement on this map might produce some queesy stomachs. 

  Personally (I guess you can gather) I find this map very well done in all areas. 

  Lighting is well done.. sounds are well done. (although I never did figure out 

  if we can control the train whistle) that would be a good way of announcing 

  your position *hey!! I'm up here, get me if ya can!!!* 

<p><b>Other:</b><br>

  First off, I must say this is my first review here at MapDepot.. I hope the 

  first of many reviews that I give. (after saying that... on with the comments) 

  iThere are very FEW maps that I would say are "must downloads" this is one of 

  them. Gameplay is very fast and intense. You never know if someone is packin 

  a m4 on the next train car, or even if someone IS on the next car until you 

  get to the door. VERY well done map in all aspects. BunnyX should be applauded 

  for not releasing a v1 before the v2, I know mappers are anxious to show off 

  there work, but geeze, I have 2 versions of urban.. (with another on the way 

  soon) 3 versions of ruins... etc... I just wish mappers would wait a little 

  while for the finished project before they uploaded there maps (bitchin is now 

  over hehehehe) 

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  I find this map to be very entertaining, fun-filled.. and all the good things 

  that Action Quake is supposed to be. Download this map, you won't be disapointed... 

  and if you are disapointed you're a llama! j/k

<p><b>Architecture & Layout score</b> = 6/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Well, it's obvious this map wasn't made to be an arechitectural masterpiece, 

  but it's map for a game, I don't spend time staring and analyzing at the map, 

  I spend most of the time killing the other people on the map at the time. But, 

  still looks neat for a train. 

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> = 4/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br>

  From the outside it looks like a train, the inside tries to look like a train. 

  Sure, there's tables, seats, crates, rooms, beds, but the colors and textures 

  are questionable. The lighting on the roof is great though, I didn't expect 

  it to be really bright, good for the sniper in you that likes to hide in the 

  dark places. 

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> = 10/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br>

  This map is great for gameplay, try a game with your friends where you can only 

  jump kick on the roof, it's great. The tight corridors make it perfect for just 

  about any weapon, but the handcannon really rules the map. Hanging on to the 

  side of the train and sniping through the windows of the cars is always fun. 

  Mighty careful stepping required, so you don't slip and break your ass on the 

  tracks, adding another level of tension. 

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> = 7/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Ambiance? Since when did maps have to be rated on ambiance? Well, it did make 

  me whistle the theme from Mission: Impossible while I played it, if that counts. 

  It just gives you the mood of a neat action movie, and that's great. 

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  A good and original map that was not made for detail or to look pretty, but 

  for great fun. Download and play this, get a good ping and it'll be a great 

  time.

<p><b>Architecture & Layout score</b> = 7/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Good layout for a 6-10 deathmatch. The effects of being able to get back on 

  train after falling off, before you die are weird (although i have usually only 

  4 health). Overall the map is great and i like the ability the slide along side 

  of train to sneak up on windows. This is a hard map for campers because it isn't 

  huge. 

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> = 7/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Looks pretty good. The black wall at front and back are annoying and they should 

  try to put a model of a train tunnel. Though sometimes things like that aren't 

  that easy. 

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> = 8/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Some great fun for deathmatch. This one feels like a Steven Seagal action movie, 

  cause most of his are on trains and ships. This wouldn't be good for teamplay 

  because of its small size and moving ground (pushing teamates). 

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> = 7/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br>

  It's not bad nor good. It's just a kill the enemies or try to force them of 

  the train mood. Thats what i like about this map. (Tip: If you have fragmentation 

  grenade and enemy is in a room or front, launch it in, an almost definite kill). 

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  Mostly like those Under Siege movies, except the train is smaller and has less 

  mean for Teamplay.

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  This is the best map so far. The map is based on a moving train, and you really 

  get tyhe feeling that you are mooving. The only problem that this map has is 

  that it is too small. It is excellant on DM, but teamplay I am not so sure about. 

  I hope we see more of these moving type of maps in the future. 

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> = 8/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The map looks great, but when I first spawned on the map the walls didn't really 

  resemble a train. BunnyX could have also added a little more detail to the map. 

  But the train moving really makes this a great map. I like the hallways of the 

  map because they are really thin and it is great for a handcannon. I also saw 

  a lot of new creative textures on this map! 

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> = 10/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br>

  This is one of the best handcannon/shotgun levels so far. Main reason because 

  the hallways are so thin. Snipers and knives also work very nicely for the same 

  reason. There is also a roof that you can climb onto. I like jumping of the 

  roof on the train tracks, don't know why but its fun! The only problem is that 

  you die when You jump on the tracks. 

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> = 10/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br>

  As I said previously, you really feel like you are in a train. I think that 

  this map will reach to other mappers to create moving maps, because just plain 

  maps are getting boring. BunnyX has created a new age of mapping!!! I love this 

  map a lot, but not a lot of servers are playing it :( 

<p><b>Other:</b><br>

  THis map is really great and I hope that more servers use it. 

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  BunnyX has done a great job with bxtrain2 and I hope that future maps take his 

  idea of moving objects. Everything on the map is great except that the map is 

  small and might be laggy with a large crowd. Overall this is the best map so 

  far!

  This truly is an original map, to action that is. I reminds me of the train 

  in Goldeneye, but with the ability to climb to the roof. This introduces new 

  tactics to teamplay, and you really must watch your step or you'll find youself 

  smashed like a grape beneath the deadly, searing tracks. 

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> = 7/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Many original textures that did fit well into the action/train theme. Although 

  I did not like the fact that if and individual falls off the train, sometimes 

  there body seems to travel with the train. They appear to be floating on the 

  quick moving ground. You have to see this to fully understand. Also the control 

  room in the front of the train was lacking detail. It would have been cool to 

  have a locked room with a terrified enginer controlling the train. 

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> = 8/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br>

  I only care about Teamplay since that is all I play, so I believe either the 

  shot gun or the MP5/10 with laser are the prime weapon choices. Also maybe the 

  handcannon, but I dislike the handcannon with a passion. The confined hallways 

  make it extremely difficult to travers without getting stuck behind another 

  teammate/idiot. If several teammates are trapped in one hall way, they can find 

  themselves cut down in seconds by and enemy with the M4. The roofs are fun to 

  shot people off, but you don't get any frags for it :-(. 

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> = 9/10

<br><b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The darkness of the roofs, and the cargo thrown about the different trailers 

  fits well into the theme of a hijacked train. 

<p><b>Other:</b><br>

  This is a unique map, so it is up to the individual action players to decided 

  whether they like it or not. I can see that some people will love it, and some 

  will hate it. I just advise that everyone download it and give it a shot.

  = Heh, the layout on this map is pretty sweet. Though it is just a straight-away 

  map, I liked the placement of objects and walls to slightly impede movement 

  and force shooters to not sit back but to charge. Boxes are arranged to give 

  cover, and the passenger section of the train allows one to duck between the 

  seats and take adequate cover. The layout of the rooms allow for ambush points, 

  as their doors are perpendicular to the hallways. The straight hallways makes 

  lining up multiple targets easy. </font> 

<p><b>How It Looks score</b> = 9/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Hell, I was stunned when I first saw this map. THE TRAIN WAS MOVING, or so it 

  seemed. The mapper made the background of the map very realistic, the train 

  was not moving, but the tunnel itself moved. The train actually looks like a 

  train, with windows, ladders, seats, lounge area, and even a light at the front 

  of the train. The interior color of the train was a little funky looking, a 

  peachy orange color. Besides that, the looks on this baby will blow most Action 

  players away. 

<p><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> = 9/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Gameplay on this map is extremly close-quarters, except on the dangerous roof. 

  Battles are short and sweet, as this is one of the smallest maps for Action 

  Quake. I suggest close quarter weapons and kevlar for a map like this, for instance 

  a shotgun with the body armor. Roof fighting is dangerous because on hit on 

  you may knock you off the train onto the burning tracks:). The narrow hallways 

  and tight quarters allows shooters to not be that good of shots and still hit. 

  Nothin' better than someone coming around the corner right up to the barrel 

  of your M4! 

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> = 10/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Heh, this map reminds me of a scarry anti-terrorist takedown of a train that 

  is occupied with terrorists. One team starts at one end of the train, another 

  team starts at the other side. Just like a mini-war, men shout commands to cover 

  this door, and people sneak up on the roof on others. It creates a very action 

  themed experience. The cars have to be cleared out one by one, and every car 

  is an fight waiting to happen, nice job there BunnyX! 

<p><b>Other:</b><br>

  Teamplay was awesome; however, since that is pretty much all I play, I don't 

  know much about the DM value of this map. 

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  I was itching to play this map, and today I did on an AR server. The experience 

  was fast, one of the fastest maps on Action Quake. This means no waiting, and 

  no camping. There is pretty much no where to hide nor no where to camp. Great 

  job with this one!

  Well, this is definately a train. And it looks pretty cool. Unfortunately, a 

  train is nothing but long, narrow corridors. Long corridors do not make for 

  great battles. In teamplay, this map is a little narrow and long for it. I would

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  I admit, this was pretty fun at first. But most maps are. The problem is that 

  those long corridors begin to get on your nerves after awhile. I mean, there's 

  basically one way to go. 

<p><b>Ambiance score</b> = 10/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Ambiance is where this map shines. No map before has so completely encaptured 

  the feel of what it is like this one. I mean, this IS a train in a dark tunnel. 

  The moving walls are soo cool;it really feels like the train is moving. The 

  train sound is dead on. The lighting is really nice;outside its dark with a 

  few lights but nice and bright inside, with those lights shining through the 

  windows against the tunnel walls. 

<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  Overall, this map is slightly above average, mainly for its originality. The 

  problem is that a train is just not right for a map, at least not this train. 

  Those narrow halls are the main reason. Something that I think would have greatly 

  improved this map is if there were two trains side by side. That would provide 

  more movement options and make a "fuller" map.
