  <b>Review:</b><br>

  This map is one of the most detailed maps (if not THE most detailed) for Action 

  Quake... It has a theme that it actually sticks to for most of the map... The 

  buildings actually make sense in the layout... and all the little brushes look 

  great (ie. computers to doornobs)... Everything is in correct proportion to 

  the player model (a big plus in my book)... The texture usage is top notch, 

  because it uses different textures without being tacky... 

<p> The feel of the map is nice... The doors are wide enough that you can run 

  through the doorway without getting stuck on the side... (BTW, again on textures 

  and detail... there is even a threshold strip below the door)... The many hallways 

  are still wide enough to provide ample room to gun-it-out with other people 

  in the hall... Even with all the detail, the map still has a very smooth framerate 

  on my p166 w/ voodoo1... The map is nicely lit with plenty of dark areas to 

  hide in... 

<p> Weapon placement is nicely spaced out through the map and with a certain weapon 

  (hint, hint M4) placed that fighting your way there is only half the problem... 

  You gotta earn that shit... Ammo is a little low (I personally like that... 

  makes people aim first)... 

<p> Ok...the map is very, very large, most of the areas are all separate, so this 

  is a 8+ map only... anything lower than that, then you better find the slippers... 

  Most of the areas have only one exit (from what I could find) allowing the building 

  to be guarded alittle to easily... BTW, I've found a secret passage...so I can 

  only assume that there might be more, thus cancelling the previous remark... 

<p> The Lowdown... The map is a beautiful with a smooth feel... It will work for 

  any 'net server... The map is one of the larger downloads but it's easily worth 

  the time... <br>

  Tally...<br>

<p><b>Review:</b><br>

  Before you read any further, start downloading this one and then read on. This 

  is a must-have. This map is great. And if you feel otherwise afterwards, write 

  a review yourself :Z .Okay, where is it about and why is it great then? It is 

  a fairly large map with a bit of a city. The bit is a hotel, streets, power 

  generator, parking, gun shop, sewer and more. The problem with large maps are 

  often that it takes a while to get familiar with it, so you you know where to 

  hide, get your stuff and all. Not with this map! It is setup in a way that is 

  very natural to you. Roads where you find the gun-shop and the hotel, more in 

  the back of the town the building with the power generator and in the alleys 

  you find and entrance to the sewer. All like in real life, so it takes no effort 

  and little time to get around well. 

<p> Then the details: great! A cash register (with flashing lights) at the desk 

  of the gun shop, with the living area of the owner above the shop. The glass 

  is really see-through and you have some great laughs, struggles and fights with 

  them. The parking garage is the best I've ever seen so far. And check out hotelroom 

  102: there has been some sort of fight there, the bed is not made, TV on the 

  ground, mirror in the bathroom broken, bloodstains on the door of the shower 

  cabin. And they're just details. Neat, really neat. I could fill a page with 

  all the outstanding details. 

<p> What's more great then? Well, it is a theme! It continues throughout the map, 

  it flows, you'll get caught in it. But besides the looks and lay-out of the 

  map there are more great aspects in this map. The author has kept an eye on 

  the gameplay too: all the objects that add detail are not in the way (I hate 

  it when that happens) when it comes to a fight! And then just one example: The 

  hotel has long hallways in which you can run around. Might you "only" have a 

  pistol and see someone coming in the hall with the M4, you need not be dead 

  yet!! Flee in one of the hotelrooms which are well designed: you can wait for 

  an surprise attack (one pistol shot in the head and the M4 is yours you know 

  =) )in the closet behind the door, behind the bed or even in the shower cabin, 

  maybe your opponent shoots all of his M4 clip at the "invisible" glass door 

  of the showercabin =) I've already had some great fights in here!! And this 

  is just one example, the map is full of opportunities for varied gameplay. The 

  sewer with the flowing dirty (though a bit visible) water, go silently in duck 

  and let the stream take you to your opponent and shoot him from under water/shit-piss-puke-and-all. 

  Great great great. I could go on for hours. 

<p> The different parts in this map offer so many kinds of play. Long range sniping, 

  close combat, knive kills too =), ducking, covering, running, aiming, just blasting 

  away, cool grenade opportunities, using the enviroment (desks,beds,showers, 

  pillars, doors, closets, dirty sewer water, closets) it's all in here. So the 

  gameplay is great. Even with just a few players in it, you get a real hunting 

  game. The weaponplacement is outstanding, as well as the ammo placement. Just 

  a word on that: most of you agree (as well as I) that the M4 is mostly dominating 

  the game, but not here. There is just ONE clip for it so you won't get far spraying 

  bullets everywhere =). The ammo is sparse and that is a good thing, it adds 

  to the gameplay! Action Quake as it should be, if you ask me. 

<p> Are there any bad things? Hardly: maybe when you play with a few others and 

  one good rifleman hangs out on the wall-that-marks-the-end-of-the-level, he 

  could be dominating. But is not very likely. The textures on the walls outside 

  remind a bit of quake2 but the amount of details on the street gives you a more 

  real-life feeling than quake2 feeling, don't worry. 

<p> Oh, before I forget: if you want to check it out, you can already play a form 

  of teamplay (with capture the "flag"), check out the details in the blockwar.txt 

  file. So, your downloading should be done for now, get it up and running. <br>

<p><b>Review:</b><br>

  Now I'm a newbie when it comes to map reviews so I'll give it my best shot. 

<p> Blockwar is one of those maps where it just takes so DAMN long to get to the 

  other side of the map! But its big enough to have hmmmm i dunno....34 players! 

  Very good for LAN or your own TCP/IP connection tho! 

<p> The textures in Blockwar are pretty good (just look at the doors!) It has 

  a gun shop, a Motel (a huge motel to be exact!) Lots and lots of streets, and 

  a sewer system ( I probly shouldnt tell u M4 hogs out there, but the M4 is in 

  a deep hole in the sewer( just don't rush it or you will be 2 feet shorter!) 

<p> The overall gun/ammo placement is good considering the sheer size of this 

  map, It runs a bit slow on anything under a P-200 but if say u have a great 

  connection, you'll have no problem. 

<p> There are lots of sniper points in Blockwar (my favorite is on the lamp tops 

  on the streets) you can climb the drain pips on the walls to. 

<p> All-in-all I'd say get this map cause it's (in my mind) the best Action Quake 

  2 map out there.So get it already stop reading my review!!! <br>

<p><b>Review:</b><br>

  Of all the maps the Depot has to offer, blockwar defeats them all by leaps and 

  bounds. This level is superbly constructed, from the great details and blending 

  of textures, it provides an experience of realism and adds much more depth to 

  the gameplay. This has to be THE level for teamplay, hands down. Though it gets 

  tough with under three people per team, as finding opposing players proves often 

  times difficult. However, if you manage to find and eliminate them, the feeling 

  of gratification you receive will be well worth it. The more ppl playing, the 

  funner this map becomes. Fun is multiplied tenfold if the team members communicate 

  with one another, such as assigning members to hold the roof of the hotel, guard 

  entrances, and sending out scouting teams, etc. If all members cooperate and 

  don't go off on their own running and gunning, (unless decided upon, of course)then 

  victory will almost surely be in their grasp. Against a scrappy, unorganized 

  team, teams who use communication as a means of strategy and deployment will 

  completely obliterate their sorry opponents. If both teams make use of these 

  strategies, then this is where the real fun begins... =o) Trying to out guess 

  your opponents on where they will strike next is very exciting..though sometimes 

  proves to be very painful =o( Will they come through the huge garage doors? 

  Are they coming through the parking garage via the sewers? Or both?????? Why 

  don't you download it and play it now to find out.....(and look out for my sneaky 

  ass!!) <br>

<p><b>Review:</b><br>

  One of the things that I like most about Action Quake2 is the element of realism 

  in its map design. I like all of the starbases and futuristic labs that make 

  up the majority of regular Quake2 maps, but ever since the days of DOOM, I've 

  been fascinated by attempts to simulate real-world areas in the game. With that 

  in mind, Blockwar was a map that I enjoyed from the first time I played it. 

<P> This map is BIG - it includes several streets, an underground parking garage, 

  sewers, a gun shop, a generator room, and a very detailed hotel. It can take 

  a while to learn one's way around, but even with all of this size and detail, 

  frame rates remain smooth throughout (my system, btw, is a P200 MMX, 64MB, Canopus 

  Pure3D Voodoo1). This map really shines in medium-large (6+ players) deathmatch 

  games. It's not the best map out there for 1-on-1 play, and can be a little 

  slow for teamplay (it can take a looong time to hunt down those stragglers), 

  but this is by no means a criticism - different maps work well in different 

  environments, and Blockwar is one of the few maps which can support 8 or more 

  players without it turning into a total mindless fracas (which also has its 

  own appeal). 

<P> Texturing is simple but effective. I would have liked to have seen a little 

  more "window dressing" in this department (perhaps some art on the hotel walls, 

  or graffiti, or something), but too much of that can slow the map down, and 

  would have spoiled the "concrete & steel" aesthetic of the map. As it is, there 

  is a remarkable amount of detail from just using simply-textured geometric shapes, 

  such as all the furniture in the hotel rooms (the TVs, showers, etc. look very 

  nice). 

<P> My biggest criticisms of the map involve specific, fairly minor points, which 

  are mostly shortcomings of the Quake2 engine, but are still things mapmakers 

  should take into account. For instance, in the gun shop, there are two grenades 

  in a display case and a box of shotgun shells on a shelf - these items can just 

  be *hard* to reach, with an undue amount of finicky jumping and ducking involved. 

  This sort of thing just detracts from the illusion of reality, espescially when 

  you are in the middle of a firefight, and *should* be able to just reach down 

  and pick up the grenade, but instead there is all sorts of elaborate wiggling 

  necessary to find the "sweet spot". The other similar complaint I have is with 

  the placement of the M4, which is at the bottom of a vertical drainage pipe 

  in the sewers, surrounded by long ladders on all sides. As we all know, climbing 

  down ladders in Quake2 is dangerous business - the game just doesn't handle 

  it that well - so what should be an easy operation ends up causing you to plummet 

  to your death 80% of the time. It's frustrating when your game character can 

  effortlessly leap from rooftop to rooftop and perform countless death-defying 

  stunts, but then dies from trying to board a ladder. 

<P> Overall, Blockwar is a first-rate map, espescially when there's a lot of people 

  on the server. I look forward to future maps to future maps from Brian McClelland. 

<P> RATING: 9.5/10

<p><b>Review:</b><br>

  The fact that this is my favorite level could contribute to a bias on my part. 

  But c'mon! This map practically has it all. The details are exellent, the weapon 

  placement is just, the ammo is sparse, leading to a wholesome encouragement 

  of accuracy. The overall theme is good, and makes sense throughout. There is 

  a minimum of Tomb-Raider clone jumping junk, and generally allows smooth play. 

<p> Structure: The small rooms and hallways in the Motel are perfect for blowing 

  a hole in someone's chest large enough to watch TV through with Mr. Twelve, 

  the L-shaped street between the gun store and the garage doors is perfectly 

  suited to the mad-MP5 toting maniac wearing kevlar, and the longer hallways 

  in the hotel make a sniper think he has died and gone to heaven. Camping in 

  the very end of the second story hallway and capping people as they run up the 

  stairs is very sweet, although continuing behavior of this type for more than 

  12 or 13 kills merely ensures enmity for life from the other players. (The trick 

  is to keep an eye on the pipe/ledge/window entrance.) Even with less than five 

  people, this map is still fun, as most people get out of the sewer or gunstore, 

  and head into the street, M4 (or whatever) in hand. The shotgun is a good weapon 

  for most of this map, but going up against someone with the good ol' SSG 69 

  is suicidal on those long shots. 

<p> Items like flashing lights on the cash-register, a dumpster with camping capability, 

  and an interestingly deadly fan on the roof really make this level. (Nothing 

  like accidently chasing a weapon into the jaws of death to really liven up your 

  day.) Due to the scarcity of ammo, the dual-45 setup is often quite useful. 

  The MP5 is really the king of this map, as it has plenty of ammo and is suited 

  to everything but dropping the odd sniper. 

<p> As I am not much of a teamplayer, I am a bit vague on the teamplay value of 

  this map, but organized teams defending the Motel are deadly to a ridiculous 

  degree. (A guy with the MP5 behind the desk, one on the roof with the sniper 

  rifle, and some others in the foyer can go through opponents like a shotgun 

  slug through a 4-year old's spleen.) 

<p> As some of the fire-corridor's outside are rather long, crouching comes more 

  in handy than you might think at first. (Still getting your head blown inside-out 

  is not cool.) The single pistol on semiautomatic is quite useful, for (and I 

  cannot stress this enough) accuracy is a definite must anywhere other than the 

  motel rooms. Sure, spray-n-pray can take down some people, but that is also 

  a quick one-way ticket to No-Clip City. 

<p> This map has some very sweet kills on it, like the handcannon while hiding 

  in the dumpster, (a hilarious, if rare, kill.) the sniper bullet in the forehead 

  in the long hallway, the dual-pistol facelift in sewer, or the legless-wonder 

  MP5 blast. Or another personal favorite, climbing the drainpipe, going in the 

  window and gutting a hopeful sniper. 

<p>Anyway, this map is pure frag, and is the epitome of Action Quake II, a blend 

  of action movie genre (Anyone who has seen Face/Off will want to use the dual-pistols 

  a bit) and the good ol' plug-n-chug Quake tradition. An absolute must for the 

  discriminating player.

  </font>

<font face="arial" size="2">

<p>Blockwar has received nothing but praise from my fellow reviewers...yet one 

  has to wonder why over half of any DM server will empty out upon this map's 

  arrival. 

</font> 

<p> Let's begin with appearance. Firstly, the premise is a bit weak. The architecture 

  fairly unrealistic and there is a severe lack of detail. This map has been called 

  detailed before, but please, take a look around: it's one of the most sparse 

  maps around. However, blockwar is nonetheless one of the better looking AQ2 

  maps around: textures are well-done and very clean, and the place does have 

  enough atmosphere overall. 

<p> And now gameplay. For deathmatch, this map is simply one of the worst around. 

  While it has all the basic elements (good presentation, low r_speeds, good frames), 

  it's simply too big: hunting / gathering may be ideal for a QW/Q2 duel, but 

  in AQ2 (especially FFA), it's just tedious. And this tedium isn't helped by 

  the fact that ammo is fairly sparse. I truly do not exagerrate when I cite the 

  people leaving upon this map's appearance. 

<p> Even in teamplay it's annoying to spend 15 minutes looking for your opponents 

  (I dare not think about a 1 v 1 hunt in this map...), although TP does play 

  reasonably well here. But then, TP is pretty boring to start with, isn't it? 

  ;) 

<p> It's a pity the map is so professionally made; serverops are running a map 

  that wouldn't have a second chance if it looked only a bit over-average. 

<p> So my ratings: 

<p> Aesthetics: 8.5/10<br>

  Atmosphere: 7/10<br>

  Deathmatch: 5/10 

<ul>

  <li>Entity placement: 4/10 

  <li>Playability: 8/10 

  <li>Fun factor: 4/10 

</ul>

Teamplay: 7/10<br>

<b>Overall: 6.5/10</b> 

<p> To clarify, atmosphere is simply an extension of appearance. It encompasses 

  realism, setting, and so on, all very important when it comes to AQ2. In contrast, 

  aesthetics is simply how nice everything looks. Criteria such as architecture, 

  details, and textures may fall in both categories, but can be more effective 

  in some areas than others. Oh yeah, entity placement only refers to guns and 

  ammo, and playability is a combination of stuff like stickiness, badly placed 

  ladders, nonsensical AIR STRIKES (ahem), and r_speeds and frame rates (they're 

  not the same, trust me).
