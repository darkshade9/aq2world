<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR> nicley laid out, if you start on the water side, you must climb a little cliff and goto the doors, if on the other side some housing area. The team coming from the housing side has the avantage in my view, the can come down on the enemy throwing grenades or spraying automatics at the climbing enemy. Although the water starters can pick off the enemy coming down the hill from the lighthouse or boat. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR> a nice looking map, the lighthouse is beautifully done and the boat is a great touch, the house is great with a tv and somehting in that toilet... The maker has added a nice hilly area with numerous ways to get up and a cement drive which can lead to battles. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR> a good map for the shotgun and handcanon players, some very tight situations for quick kills,altho snipers can ruin this one, if there good enough to saty up in that lighthouse and pick off anythintg coming through the doors, but usually i've found no one uses the lighthouse at all, usually 2 teams rushing and attacking witha big collision at the doors. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR> a nice peacfully night, the crickets chirping the water washing up on the shore *BANG BANG* broken by the sound of gunfire, the sounds are great, giving it a realistic feel of being at an actuall lighthouse, even the tv has sound adding more charecter to this map. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Other Comments:</B><BR> This would be a good map for games of 4-12 teamplay or dm would be great on this one </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR> The maker of this one really did a fantastic job, it's a great map which i love to play for teams, a map you should defiantly go download and play with your friends. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR> Not much to say, itï¿½s pretty good work, decent r_speeds and good lighting. The inside of the house is the only place where there's room for improvements, mostly so that more gameplay would be situated there. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR> The outside area is pretty spiffy, lighting is done well, and the sky fits like a glove. textures are mostly good, and no misaligned textures/brushes and suchlike can be found. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR> The gameplay is somewhat halted by the two "door-areas", ie the two hallways between the outside/inside areas. Those two hallways should've been replaced by something else. Perhaps a road or something. </FONT><P>

This is a well layed out map with a good selection of areas to run about in. The house is okay (with ren + stimpy on the t.v.)but you won't be there very long. The outside area is just the right size so that you can pick off people from a distance with the humble pistol (a favoured tactic of mine) and there is a dark area on top of the lighthouse for snipers (booooo!!!). The funniest thing on this map is shooting people as they swim about in the sea trying to get to dry land, and the gardens and tunnel systems are cool as well. </FONT><P>

Looks arent everything, but this level runs pretty well in software mode, but running on a voodoo3 it runs like a dream. However, the textures are only okay, outside it is just sand and grass(i know its a beach so perhaps ill let the author off on that one) and i like the garden. As i said before you dont really spend much time in the house as there isnt much in there, but it looks nice. The boat is a neat touch, and lighting is used appropriately. Overall quite good. </FONT><P>

This is where this map shines. There are just so many ways to play it, that its hard not to love it. Running about the garden, jumping the fountaint and diving behind hedges during a shoot out is great, and there arent many places for snipers (the house balcony and the actual lighthouse are the only decent ones), but the level is designed in such a way that even snipers wont be safe if they dont move about a bit. Underwater fights are a laugh-just remember to come up for air!!! If your bored go watch ren and stimpy on the t.v. in the house-a welcome distraction from the mindless violence! </FONT><P>

This map isnt really where youd expect a big gunfight to take place, but its surprisingly fun. There are good well lit areas, and a few dark spots. You will spend most of your time on the beach though, as that is where most of the weapons are, and also where most of the gunfights take place. The house is really just a safe-base to bandage and pick up a few clips. The garden is good, creating a good mood when you gun someone down as they despretely try to hide behind a hedge or make it to the shed. On the beach is good as its dark, so darker skins come in ahndy here, and its nice and big, not to mention the huge sea off the pier. The map creates a wonderful mood that allows you to enjoy the map a lot, and is a welcome break from all the city levels with their drab brown textures and skyscrapers.Top stuff! </FONT><P>

I'm still undecided as to what score i should give weapon placement. All the weapons seem to be mainly situated on the beach/cliff area, and while this means you spend a lot of time there, it also means you may find yourself being picked off just as you reach a decent weapon. Perhaps more weapons in the house or garden would have been better. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>
Overall a great map, lots to see, plenty of places to kill people in and good overall layout. As i said before, its a nice break from all the other maps that are getting very similar nowadays. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>Right out from the start this map puts across it's feeling excellently. The basic layout of the map consists of the beach house which is a simple 5 room home with two bedrooms one bathroom and what looks to be a kitchen. Then the courtyard with a fountain in the center, off to the left is a mini barn type building. The best part however are the lighthouse and boat found outside of the courtyard. The boat is great and looks ver believable. The lighthouse is nice pretty simple but it IS just a lighthouse. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>I think the creator of this map had an idea in his head when he went into development and he displayed it pretty well. The few things that keep this map from a 10 are that i think the house could've used a little more detail. The rooms are pretty plain without much detail to them. However the outer area of the level is quite specatcular.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Rating:</B> 10/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>I've yet to play this map in teamplay but as a DM map it rox! Plenty of placeful for u campers to prop up yer tents, like behind the lighthouse and if u're good enough in the boat! Not too much of a handcannon map unless u're in the courtyar, overall best weapon as usual is the MP5 (preferable silenced since it's a dark map).</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>Right off from when I first beamed into the level I knew exactly what the building I was in was supposed to be. The beachhouse is very believeable and while it could've been bigger it still feels right. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>Bear with me since this is my first review people! I thought this map deserved an honest opinion though.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>Overall this map really kix ass! I love sniping and this map has tons of it. But there IS something fro everyone so if u're into high paced games and lots of blood download this map now!</FONT><P>
