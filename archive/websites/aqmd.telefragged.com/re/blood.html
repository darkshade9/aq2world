<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>This map reminds me of Blockwar, which is a bad thing. I think there are
way too many places to hide and camp in. The architecture can be described as
simplistic functionalism, which translates roughly as "where did you hide all the details?".
On the bonus side, the layout does permit the use of all weapons, so no sprayer/sniper 
advantages here. All in all nothing really catches my eye with its brilliance and thus I can't
give too many points for this one.</FONT><P>

  Architecture & Layout score</b> 9/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The general layout of this map may be common, but it sure isin't boring to look 

  at. The buildings have more then the average ammount of detail you usally find 

  in a Action Quake2 map, the streets are large enough to have a good fight without 

  having to worry about bumping into a wall. Sure, some of the textures look pretty 

  misplaced or overused, but overall, the ammount of detail and the quality of 

  the layout is well worth a 9/10. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>How It Looks score</b> 10/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  There's no doubt about this, Goose knows how to do lighting and texture choosing! 

  The streetlights are by far the most realistic i've seen, producing a nice ammount 

  of light that adds ALOT to the ambience of the map. The overall ambient lighting 

  of the map is just awesome. It's well-balanced and it doesn't stick out in certain 

  spots. It's not too bright or not too dark. Awesome! </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Can you say M4 plus laser sight? This level is perfect for both close-up attacks 

  and long-range sniping. It's well balanced throughout the map with the rooftops, 

  ladders and streets. The ammo and weapon placement was well thought of and is 

  pefectly balanced. The one thing that can get annoying is if someone hides in 

  one of the bedrooms in the hotel building. Rounds can then last forever untill 

  someone finds the lamer. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Ambiance score</b> 7/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  As noted above, the awesome lighting adds alot of ambience to the map. The main 

  thing that's missing though is an appropriate ammount of ambient sounds. You 

  need good ambient sounds to add ambiance! An ambiance freak will find this map 

  an average map. A little more work could have been done on this. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Other:</b><br>

  The r_speeds of this map are awesome! Everyone has an equal chance of playing 

  no matter their system configuration. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  This map is well worth the download, it has all the basic qualities you know 

  and love in Action Quake2 maps...plus a little extras. I look forward to another 

  great map from Goose! </font>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  This map is bland. That in a nutshell describes the ENTIRE level. Boring greyish 

  buildings and dark scenery make for a dull experience. The insides of 90% of 

  the buildings are empty, no cover, no eye candy, maybe just a crappy looking 

  desk here and there. The hig points of this map were especially delicious (metaphorically, 

  of course). I totally digged (dug?) the design of the semi-truck, the inside 

  of the warehouse, and the overly ornate ladders. Not too much trouble in the 

  r-speed area so it should run like a redneck with his a$$ on fire. Overall, 

  it ain't the best looking gal at the dance, but she puts out. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>How It Looks score</b> 5/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  UGH! C'mon here! I mean, the same boring dull textures that I've seen everywhere. 

  Now I know that cities don't have many different textures, but it can be done 

  better than this. Also, mis-matches (the candy vending machines? Lights in a 

  few places too) and sloppily constructed textures make for a slightly unrealistic 

  effect. </font>

  Been there, done that. If you already haven't played the Urban set, ChrisCity3,

  as i was playing i couldn't figure out how i was supposed to get down from high 

  spots w/o killing myself... but if ya look hard enough, there's usually a way

  this is a BIG map... in teamplay it was really slow w/ 2 people to a team, w/ 

  3 it was ok, but sometimes slow-paced... although it does kinda make ya keep

  This way this map is setup is pretty good. I mean, its basically buildings but 

  it flows fairly well. Oh, and this map is HUGE. There are a lot of places to 

  go. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>How It Looks score</b> 6/10 <br>

  The look is average. There's nothing special about the textures or buildings. 

  They're your basic big brick buildings. It could have used a little more variety 

  in building designs and some details. Nothing special in this area. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  This is a pretty fun map. I like city maps and this is a pretty good one-not 

  the best but not the worst. The only problem is that it is too big, with a lot 

  of places to go. Rounds tend to drag towards the end as players struggle to 

  find each other. Closing off a few areas would have been good or more intersting 

  access ways. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Ambiance score</b> 5/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Well, it looks like a section of some industrial area. But other than that, 

  there isn't much eye or ear candy. Its your basic city map with average lighting 

  and average textures. Not much else to say about it. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Other:</b> </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  Overall, I would rank this above average. There are few drawbacks. However, 

  there isn't much innovation either. The biggest problem is its shear size. No 

  matter how many players this is for, the last two spend eons finding each other.

  Architecture & Layout score</b> 6/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  I can only compare this map to blockwar, and, well, I loved blockwar. It's a 

  city type setting, but the focus is more on being on the streets below the buildings 

  as opposed to the more Urban style roof top fights. Although there are many 

  insides of buildings and roof tops that are accessible, it is mainly a street 

  fight. I would have given this segment a better mark, but the layout had one 

  major flaw: many parts of the map were accessible only by the use of ladders, 

  and the ladders were very poorly placed and tended to be only usable when heading 

  up. Often I found myself climbing a ladder, reaching a roof top, wanting to 

  get down, and dying miserably during the attempt because there was no other 

  way down. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>How It Looks score</b> 7/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The map is relatively plain in look, but it has a very nice colour scheme, sort 

  of reddish purple, very dark like. It works well with the whole quake engine 

  deal, and is never too bright or too dark. There are shadows about, but no one 

  becomes completely lost in them, it works more in the way that someone is not 

  seen for a second in the shadows, giving them enough time to shoot you before 

  it's too late. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 7/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The map was pretty fun, but I found all that ever happened is I'd turn a corner, 

  be on the street, and someone would be high up on a ledge, and a lot of shots 

  would be fired and someone would die (of course, this is how the game works). 

  But it seemed that contact with others always occured at the same places, at 

  least in teamplay, and if anyone decided to camp out in a building the round 

  would go on forever. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Ambiance score</b> 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  The colour scheme is really very attractive. It looks a hell of a lot nicer 

  than say avenue..it has a similar colour, but a much nicer and darker red tone. 

  The large truck is a nice addition, and is much better done than your average 

  vehicle in a map (those limos lend to being very ugly). </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Other:</b> </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  A good map, but those ladders really suck. I wish it was easier to climb down 

  ladders, but it ain't. That's quake for ya. Either way, it's a good map, and 

  worth playing, but gets a bit repetitive. Nothing too new either, I think I'll 

  stick with block war. </font>

  Layout wise, there is very little to fault. The whole map is nicely accessible 

  with only the warehouse being a potential hotspot for tp camping, otherwise 

  the map manages to be spacious enough to allow for decent dm games while not 

  having too many tiny rooms resulting in blockwar 1on1 syndrome. Outstanding, 

  and a resonably original layout (that is, as original as an urban map can get 

  now :) </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>How It Looks score</b> 7/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  At first glance the whole map seems very simplistic with detail being used quite 

  sparingly, but this is offset by the nice textures that goose has used throughout 

  the map. Although this may sound quite negative, you quickly notice the gains 

  associated with the lack of fine detail, even on my testing machine (p100/16meg/12meg 

  vII) I noticed NO slowdown whatsoever in both gl and software modes. A certain 

  other city style mapper would do well to take notes here..... </font>

  Wooo a map that I enjoy dming on! The low brush counts help this map along nicely 

  and all the tight jumps are nice and easy to manage so you dont repeatly end 

  up divebombing onto the tarmac. (Ive lost count of all the llama shaped craters 

  on urban1 :) Also this accessability encourages players to experiment running 

  round the rooftops and ledges rather than camping behind doors with handcannons.

  My final point is that as good as a city map is, it will always be just another

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  This really is a good city map and deserves to be played on servers, the layout

  If any of you guys ever played the first version of this map.. it was just.. 

  well too big, but it has now been shrunk, and it fits great. With as few as 

  2 people this map can be excellent fun, as I often play 1 vs 1 with Goose on 

  the map. I could imagine it holding up to as many as 12 people and playing very 

  well. I am a rabid CTF player, and feel this could easily work for a teams map. 

  The one drawback I see is the internal structure of buildings, as most are too 

  blank to fit my tastes. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>How It Looks score</b> 9/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Awsome, again, except for two minor, minor, minor things the map looks awsome. 

  First off one of the walls is far too thin at the end of a street, which makes 

  it feel fake, this could have easily been fixed. The same facing on some of 

  the buildings gets monotonouse, as no 2 buildings look the same in my town. 

  Well one more thing is that one building does not all the way hit the ground, 

  as it stops at the top of a wall. The extra structural work on the outside and 

  top of buildings, although, make it look and feel even more real. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Gameplay (fun factor) score</b> 10/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  I haven't ever enjoyed a map such as this, the lighting is perfect, the silent 

  roof top battles, the shootouts in the streets, the room to room combat, jumping 

  from building to building, hiding behind many objects fit the perfect street 

  war theme, making this killer fun. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Ambiance score</b> 10/10 <br>

  Oh yes, the mood is unsurpassed. No goofy colored lighting that doesn't fit, 

  no areas too dark or too light, everything is balanced and.. realistic. The 

  night sky with the glowing stars shedding light, the street lights making their 

  pool of lights which can be seen the running attacker under. Also the deep corners 

  of inky darkness, and the moon-lit rooftop snipers. Oh my god. </font>

  and it amazes me how often it happens again. Altough this won't be a classic 

  (i think) it sure is worth a try and hopefully i'm wrong about the gameplay

  This map is really cool, it has lots of roofs, doors, and places to camp. The 

  only problem I noticed is that it is a little TOO big... If your on a server 

  with about 2-6 people you will be in for a long time...seeing that there are 

  so many places to hide, people will be camping alot. I spent a good hour walking 

  around that map and I still havent found everything. Anything above 6 guys and 

  your set. </font>

  = This Place is cool. it is [in my opinion] a mixture of both Actcity2 and urban... 

  this is shown by the many snipers spots(urban) and the real city look(Actcity 

  style). It has a warehouse, hotel, and a few other nifty things gamers wil enjoy. 

  it reminds me of a WAY beter version of Blockwar. Although in some places the 

  floor gets a bit too bright... </font>

  I'm only giving this an 8 because as I said earlier, "Its to big".. most people 

  when they are in a game dont wanna be hunting around for 30-40 minutes looking 

  for a guy who is in this remote spot and nobody can find him. </font>

  Just to let yall know what my Puter is running at.... P 166 Monster 3dfx opengl 

  and thats about all yall need to know about how crappy my puter is... </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  Overall this map ROCKS! Can get a little "confusing" at times but when you learn 

  the map, you get used to the all the doors. 8) </font>

  the set out is ok, but is oversized and is nuthin special. There ar sum good 

  snipin places, open areas and corridors, so it cators for all ppl. But yet it 

  is to monotonus, things hav just been prefab(iehe made a room, and just used 

  it ova and ovaagen) . the layout though is the best part of this map. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>How It Looks score</b> = 2/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  It all looks the same....little and no variation in textures, and a lot of q2 

  textures there. There are texture misalignments (ie a door which had the handle 

  on the wrong side). I suspect there are bent textures here to, i reckoise one 

  fron 'toxin' but these may of been used under permission, but..........make 

  your own textures ya lazy(censored). sky is ok but not great. all in all a pretty 

  non pretty map </font>

  i have server ops and at my server this map (after a quik test) was booed and 

  jiared) the ppl have spoken. its to similar to other maps and ofers little chance 

  of new fun </font>

  BEEN THERE DONE THAT, another city map, like oh yay. To make a good map nowadays 

  you need interesting things (radio in city, soveits nuke, apbase in general) 

  </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Other:</b><br>

  doesnt play well in tp coz the last couple of ppl run round for 20 mins findin 

  each other </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  Its all the same, seen it all b4. if this had been released b4 blockwar, urban, 

  city, etc than it would score alot better, it is not a terrible map but is slap 

  dash, samely and monotonus </font>
