The layout was not to bad overall. I think the level could do with being a bit larger as it was getting packed with 6 people in it. We had some good shoot outs inside the big warehouse on the edge of the dock. The teleports we well placed within the level ... hardly ever got shot after appearing.

Found that there was alot of cliping within the level which spoiled it alot. The texture was not standard ones but they did not look that good to me.

Lots of boxs and barrels to hide behind.. all though did not seem to get much time as it was a very action packed level. Think it was a bit short on amunition but i did manage to pickup alot of weapons of other people !

Quite a dark level which suites me more but it was not pitch black so you could not see yourself.

Shame about how much clipping there was spoilt it really as you could look through doors that were not open. Had some good fast shoot outs in the warehouse and as it was not a very large level you could get back quickly and re-join
