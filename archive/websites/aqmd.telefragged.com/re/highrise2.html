<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>My first review. Don't beat me to death for it, thank you. (You're welcome to say if I don't make sense, though...)
<P>
A rather original level, this one. The map's architechture forces one to move more
vertically than horizontally. The basic layout is OK, even though I never understood
what that yellow brick-textured building was supposed to represent. 
The elevators (especially the air current-using one) in the center building were
a nice touch and the platforms & the catapult put the empty space between the
buildings to use.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>Here the map falters. The textures are a bit flat and the lighting isn't that functional.
I kept wondering why the pool wasn't transparent, but figured that there would be no point in
catapulting into the pool from the other building if enemies were near it. You'd always die before getting out...
This map has no real eye candy (well, the karlsson room is fun =) but the textures
serve their purpose and the certainly are not the worst I've seen.
Just wondering, why is it so damn dark inside the yellowish building?</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Gameplay Rating:</B> 8/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>Okay, for normal TP this is not very useful. Lag is present and many people end up mangling themselves
with the catapult, the diving platforms and such. But I do think this would make a killer fun map in LAN
parties. I personally thought this the funniest map in AQ. If you play this one seriously, it'll
suck like hell. If you brighten up a bit and think "that's life" when you dive headfirst down from the
tallest building, you'll like this. 
Absolutely NOT for serious playing!</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 7/10</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>Despite the textures the ambient feeling is nice. I can't really explain it but
the map did feel like a real environment. This is one of the rare maps where
"the feeling" gets to me. This means that I can congratulate the mapper for his effort.
It's not the extreme realism that makes the map, it's the feeling that everything is in the 
right place.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>The zip structure seemed to have an error in it. 
The karlsson soundfile went to /action/soundS instead of action/sound
and thus didn't work until I switched its place to where it was supposed to be.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>A map for fun seeking players.
Serious players should skip this one.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 face="arial"><B>Overall Rating:</B> 7</FONT><P>
