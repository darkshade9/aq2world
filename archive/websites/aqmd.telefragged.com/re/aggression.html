<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR> This map has quickly became one of my favorite... it has some of the coolest gameplay around. It is built very balanced, with overhanging rooftops for SSG3k toters, and lots and lots of cover (boxes and crates and what-not) for the Auto Toy user. One of its coolest features, I think, is in its sewer system (very useful for getting behind the other team) which has crossbars now and then, which forces you to jump over them, thus, forcing you to make a splashing noise. This makes a super silent aproach imposible, making for better gameplay. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR> This is probably one of the best clan-orriented maps out there, looking wise. I played this map once before I got my Voodoo 3, and then I've been playing it with the Voodoo 3, and I think the Aggression Ranger logo might be the best looking texture I've seen employed thus far. All the textures are aligned correctly, and it has a great city-block feel... very cool. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR> I've had a lot of fun wasting my friends in this map... a LOT of fun... the sewer system is great for some awesome, cheesy-action movie fire fights. There are plenty of bulkheads in it so you can duck into cover FAST, but then pop out, crouching, and get like a 3x headshot on the approaching Tango. Very cool. Also, box placement and drainpipe placement make more great shootouts and cover... this map is like a compilization of the best maps out there... VERY AWESOME. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR> This is where the map lacks... no background sounds except in the sewer... but, lighting and just ambient structures give it a realistic feel. Good map. </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Other Comments:</B><BR> With a HUGE amount of people, this map is still manigable, because of the sewer system. It usually draws a whole new battle of its own... I usually duck in there with about two of my teammates, and we encounter a similiar group inside... VERY COOL </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR> Very awesome map... I hope =AR= keeps making these, maybe a sequal that is larger with a more extensive SEWER SYSTEM... hehe, very awesome map. </FONT><P>

This maps seems to have combined city and actcity2 and made them into one map. There is a general pathfrom one area to another, which generally makes the map into a giant square. There seems to be atleast 2 ways to enter each area, to eliminate camping, and many objects to take cover behind as toy go from area to area. The spawns also seem balenced as to not give one team an advantage over the other. </FONT><P>

This map looks excellent. (/me stops typing to change the score from 8 to 9) I can't honestly think of anything wrong with the way it looks. The textures fit the theme of the map well, and the lighting seems adequate (sp?). The sewers are dark and murky, and the outside areas are well lit with lights and such. </FONT><P>

This map seems like a blast to play on either teamplay or deathmatch. It looks like your normal "both teams collide in the middle" type map with a twist. It seems that there is no weapon that prevails on this map either, I've seen snipers and handcannoners both rule this map. The r_speeds are low in this map also, which makes it very much playable, even in that basement sewer entrance which was constructed out of triangles. </FONT><P>

Well, its a city type map, and seemed to relay the mood well. Everything seemed to fit in from the dirt basement in the house, to the bildings and ledges. The only thing that doesnt seem to fit in with the map is the secret tunnel, which, although useful and nicely lighted, did not fit the theme of the map at all. </FONT><P>

Overall, this map seems well planned and well made. There seems to be a straighforward playing style about the map also, which also adds into the fun of it. There also seems to be something in this map for everyone to enjoy, be it handcannoner or automonkey. </FONT><P>
