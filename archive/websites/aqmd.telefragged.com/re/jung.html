<b>Review:</b><br>

Like the site says, for such an open level the framerate is very good. Even when you're up on high areas. It's also well lit and sniper spots are easily identified. Though it looks more like a desert park than a jungle, it's pleasing. My only gripe is on weapon placement. There seems to be too MUCH emphasis placed on sniping. The sniper shacks can be seen for a long way, and that means whoever's inside can hit you from across the map. I can imagine a lot of frusterated deaths in this one :) Still fun though.

<b>Review:</b><br>

Okay, I like this map.  It's not the greatest map ever, but it sure works for me.  I especially love those cute little trees...

<p>

Weapons placement - There is two (2) sniper rifles), one (1) MP5, one (1) M4, one (1) sawed-off, and tons (6 - 7) of grenades (I love grenades).  If you'e smart you can always get the M4.  It always seems to be right there, as if people don't know where it is.  You have to find it yourself though, it's not THAT hard.  Hey, while I can't complain about the M4 availibility, I will complain about the absence of a regular shotgun.  I miss the shotgun on this level, although it is pleasing to  have a sawed-off to greet someone with when you get into these canyons.  The MP5 is just lying there, right in the middle.  And of course the sniper rifle(s) can be found in their nice little protective huts.

<p>

Ammo - I found ammo pretty scarce, which is good.  This means no more shooting like you've got ammo pouring out of your ass (like you do in mall2).  But the fact that the sniper ammo is like two (2) steps away from where the campers sit.  Maybe it's just me, but shouldn't they at least have to come out of their huts to get some?

<p>

Items - I hate the uselessness of the silent slipper, or the vest.  But I found that the laser sights can be very useful in taking out a sniper.  But to do that, you'll have to jump around.  And then "Mr.Sniper" will call you a "jumping bitch llama"  Everyone can basically see you a mile away, so there's no possibility of sneaking up with the slippers of silence.  The silencer is taken by one sniper, and the bandolier by the other.  The silenced one heads into the hills, and the ammo-totin' sniper crawls into his little hut with all the ammo he'll ever need.  The vest seems to do no good because the snipers have the AP rounds...

<p>

Layout - I really like how the ground is never really flat.  There's always some little bump.  And the hills area a good place to have grenade wars.  Did I already say somewhere that I like grenades?  And the huts give snipers all the protection they'll need and then some.  If you are using the desert strike skin (terror model), you can kind of sneak up, because you blend in.

<p>

Textures - What can I say, nobody is perfect.  My first thought when I joined was, ouch.  I was really disoriented, the textures made me feel WAY TOO SMALL!  They gave me a height complex, or something.  But, from the readme file, the author had to cut down the texture value to get it to run at all.  If you're used to Action Quake physics, don't trust your gut in this one.  Before you go jumping off the nice cliffs/hills, look at the base of the trees, not the ground.  I REPEAT, do not use the ground to judge how high you are.  The trees are taller than you, and if it looks like the tree's bases are going through the floor, you know you'll take damage.  Also if you play this map for a while, playing other maps becomes disorienting.  I found it rather amazing that the author can make a fun map, using like three (3) textures!

<p>

Players - I found a lot to bitch about in this map, but this map is right for almost any amount of players.  I'd say, however, that the funnest would be with like (four) 4 people.  

<p>

Overall - Don't get me wrong.  I like this map, it's fun and that's what counts.  I know how hard maps are, which is why I usually don't make them.  To Mr. Timm Stokke, keep it up.  But in the future, could you make a map that makes us all feel really BIG?

<p><b>Review:</b><br>

 In a span of two days, this has become my favorite map.  I love the fact that there are so many

high vantage points that manage to present open vistas, yet simultaneously deny viewing other

parts of the level.  Each spot has its strengths and weaknesses and the hunter must move on from

one favored spot to another in search of new prey.

<p>

As for sniping, I've found it very effective to stay out of the towers completely.  With suitable

jungle camoflage, one can sit on the side of a hill (or in a depression between two hills -- this

is a very nice touch in the map) and pick off quite a few targets before they're able to determine

the direction of fire (but a good sniper will always be on the move...).

<p>Playing with three to four others, I've found ammunition pretty scarce, but this is a good thing

and adds to the realism (just how often does one find ammunition lying around, anyway :-) ).

The only nit I'll pick (and not with just this map) is the presence of the M4.  Maps with the M4

 seem to turn into a fragfest to get  this weapon and, for me at least, that spoils the fun.

Even so, that's just a minor gripe; this is a good  map and is a lot of fun.

<b>Review:</b><br>

Teamplay Review for "Welcome to the Jungle":

<p>

"Welcome to the Jungle" is the kind of map that snipers dream of, and in teamplay it doesn't disappoint. This map is small enough to discourage hiding really far away from the action (some call it "camping", but it's easier to just call it "trying to ruin everyone's fun"), but just big enough to support fair sized teams.

<p>

Jungle lends itself to several different playing styles in teamplay, but not all of them. Sniping is one of the best ways to "own" this map, but M4 infantry and MP5 commandoes can really clean up. When the enemies all have their eyes in their scopes, a crafty little bastard can sneak right up and really give 'em the business.

<p>

This map, like "Desert Bases", has a war movie feel in teamplay. It's common to see your buddies crouching and taking cover to avoid M4 bursts and MP5 sprays. One second your teammate's there, ready to go "over the top" and attack the enemy encampment, and the next second there's a long plume of blood as he gets offed with a well-placed sniper bullet.

<p>

Too cool in my book :)

<p>

In my own humble opinion, this map is one of the best for teamplay (pretty much tied with "Cliff"), especially for quick round turnover.
