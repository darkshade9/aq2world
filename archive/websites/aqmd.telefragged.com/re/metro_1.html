The map is a symmetrical metro/subway/underground (whatever you want to call it, wherever you're from) station. All of it is underground except for one part (which has no way to get out to the above-ground part). It's an interesting size, somewhere between large,small and medium. It's orignal, not just a copy of TTI's subway maps, which was refreshing as those are the only type of subway maps besides this. There is are several ways of getting from the top to the bottom, via stairs and escalators. A lot of cool things are in there, including the escalators, which really work (though they jam sometimes). Best of all is the moving subway trains, which can run you over and crush you. </FONT><P>

There is simply no excuse for the grey and tan color scheme in this map. There are plenty of subway stations that are anything but tan and grey that I have seen. Then again, there are plenty that are like that. The textures don't clash and aren't glitchy or unaligned. The sky is drksky, but there only one part where you can see it, so it doesn't matter that much. All in all, my eyes weren't sore after playing on the map (at least, not because of the textures :), so thats why I gave it a 5 instead, say, a 3. Not much more about it, decidely average. </FONT><P>

The weapon placement was okay, had a little trouble finding a few but overall good. The M4 placement was funny, on the center track of the subway tracks, it was pretty easy to think the trains weren't coming then get crushed by both of them. Tension is high in 1v1, as your foe could be right behind you with a handcannon, or he could kick you in the way of the subway trains. TP is a a lot like subway and subway2, with skimishes on the stairs and ramps. In DM it's pretty much the same, and sadly you can't be oppsite the tracks of your foe and disappear behind one of the trains. The gameplay is also kinda avererage but still enjoyable, best for 1v1. </FONT><P>

There is a little use of noise in the bottom part, but besides that no sound is used. The vending machines add a amibiance, but not much. Plus, there could have been just a little above ground area. Also, a suggestion would be to have some sort of graffiti or decay of some kind. No subway station is ever completely free of either of those things. More billboard signs and ads and such would also have helped, kinda like in subway99. Plenty of small little niggles could have improved, like the roof over the escalator, which was nearly touching my model's head. </FONT><P>

 From the readme, it says the buildtime was around 8 days! That sounds pretty fast, even though I don't map that much. Getting run over by the train is kinda wierd if it's just one train. One other odd thing is that if you go outside the map and look at it from in the void it looks a lot like a spaceship :) </FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>
 A map that takes from subway, and a map that deviates from subway. It should have borrowed a few more things from TTI's series to improve, but that doesn't stop it from being orignal and a bit fun. </FONT><P>

This map is generally an indoor's train station. I would have to say that it was beautifully made, and has many cool features, which I like about it. However, the main thing that turned me off yo it was the size of the map. The celing height in many of the areas is just jumping height, also all of the hallways seem to be 1 to 2 people wide at the most. The tight corridors in this map give you a general clostrophobic (sp?) feeling. </FONT><P>

This map is honestly one of my favorites because of all of the work the author has put into it. From the moving escalators, to the speeding trains, this level could have some VERY good battles on it. Once again, there is only one thing I dislike about the looks of this map, the overall brown/yellow textures in the entire map. With some more color, this map could be a classic. </FONT><P>

I havent had a chance to test this on a server, but it looks to be one of the most entertaining maps ever. The trains can be used for cover in battles and could award you an easy win, or a awful loss if used right. One thing I dont much like about this map are the spinning doors. It seems to take alot of effort to make it through the doors, and you can easily get caught and strat losing health. Normally that isnt that bad, but the revolving doors almost split the map in half, and there is no way to avoid going through them if you want to go from one side to the other. </FONT><P>

The part of the map with the trains really seem to convey the feeling of intensity as the trains rush by. However, the rest of this map seems more like a normal quake2 level than an action quake2 level due to the dull textures. The lighting in this map gives good cover to all those trying to evade a persuer, but arent quite dark enough just to blatantly camp at. </FONT><P>

Although a few things could have been done to make this map a classic, it is still a very good map. I am looking forward to server's running this and hope to have a nice handcannon battle on the train tracks :) </FONT><P>
