<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR> This is a strong part of this map, but not too strong though, most of it looks ok, but it's kinda hard to find your way around the boat.
And you can't go lower than the dressing rooms. I would have liked to go down to the engine room. And there are just too many doors that you can't open, like the cabins, none of them are openable.
There is no outside to the boat. Wouldn't you like to kick somebody over the railing with no chance of getting back up... ;)
And there is just not enough boat, the deck is too small, i mean, where do they stack all the people from the cabins? Add a lower deck and water around the boat... </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR> Well, the textures are well done, at least most of them, and when you're on the inside, you feel like your in a boat. But shouldn't there be chairs in the bar/restaurant?. Then there is the outside, one word: BRIGHT
That's right, it's mostly all white, with some bright tiles on the floor, maybe it needs some chairs?
And the sky, i just couldn't stand it, that needs tidying up to.
I did like the staircase-railings, real metallic feel to them. </FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR> Well, lots of tight corridors, no sniping spots, but a sniper rifle, can't really say what it would be like playing this map with other people, but i wouldn't expect it to be much fun... 
(Leave out the rating for this one) </FONT><P>
