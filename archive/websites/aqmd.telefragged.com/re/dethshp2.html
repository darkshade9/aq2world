<b>Review:</b><br>

Dethshp2 is a great map, that come from the author of the classic Hostage(2), and the new map, It's Quitten Time. Once again the author does an outstanding job. This time he's recreating the ship from Under Siege.

<p>

There are a few distinct areas in this map, such as the cargo room, the pumping room, and the garbage room(waste room if you prefer). You can play the different areas with a different style. In the cargo hold, it's best to hide in the shadows, so that you can get a quick snipe. However, when running through the corridors, it's best to duck into the side rooms from time to time, as there always seems to be someone coming from the front, and from behind. It is also possible to win this map using only the knife, which i have done before.

<p>

The weapons placement is good. The shotgun is in the cargo hold, along with the grenades. The sniper rifle is in the pumping room. My only complaint is the M4 is too easy to find. It's just laying on the floor in one of the bunk rooms. Besides that, i have no more complaints.

<p>

This is a great map, with good balance(except for the cargo hold, where all the fighting seems to take place). I recommend getting this map if you only want the best.
