<b>Review:</b><br>



OK here is another famed and long awaited review by me :), at least I hope :). With the name complex I had two first thoughts about it, first I thought it might be a goldeneye spinoff, then I thought it might be a maze. Well I was wrong on both accounts since it was totally different. Although it did have teh goldeneye feel to it. Here we go:

<p>

Weapons- Great! A little too easy to rush, grab the weapon, and high tail it. Frequent ammo along the way.

<p>

Gameplay- I got an excellent frame rate! Not too shabby.

<p>

Textures- Reminisent of Goldeneye but had a feel of its own.

<p>

Sniper spots- YAY! This map had 3 good spots where there was only one way to get to it. You could easily snipe and watch your back at the same time! 

<p>This is a fairly small map in my book but great none the less. Another great addtion to the portals library. Keep up the good work.

<b>Review:</b><br>



The latest installment from a <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/portals/">Portals</a> Member...The ones that brought you Museum and Kumanru (those by shmitz)...This one is by Gr3ed and I can say it doesnt look pretty...This is an attempt at a TF like map for Action Quake which I dont think go together at all...This is designed with Teamplay in mind, as far as I can tell he made one side and did that mirror effect which I really dislike in teamplay maps...As I was going through it I noticed that almost every corner is 90 degrees which means that there are no exiting designs or tricky curves... Now since I havent been able to play this on a server (because I cant find ne running it) I will have to take a stab and say this will be a pretty balanced teamplay map because it is mirrored.

<p>

Structure/Design-5/10 (unoriginal and bland)<br>

Weapon Balance-8/10(doesnt really matter cause its teamplay)<br>

Gameplay-7/10(taking a guess)<br>

Framerates-10/10(small areas)<br>

How it looks-5/10(Bland)<br>

Total-70%<br>

<b>Review:</b><br>





Ok, firstly, nice map Greed. Nothing real spectacular, but it looks like it plays well. Decent R_speeds, but the map is not an "action" map. Its more of a standard Q2 Map. This is what pisses me off about lots of maps. Actionq2 maps are supposed to be realistic environments. I'm all for originality, but this map doesn't display any of that. Not a bad map for teamplay, but not the best map overall either. BTW...

The lasers are REAL cool. They are probably what stands out most in this map. Check this map out, but I have to warn you, it won't "blow you away".

<b>Review:</b><br>



To start my review off, i'd like to say many maps would stand out more with some usage of some custom textures, and some great lighting (which i havent been seeing at all in alot of maps lately), since most q2 textures blow chunks for making maps with realistic settings, and this map is no exception, it makes this map look ugly with the texture selection the author has made. it plays well, and runs very fast, no r_speeds/fps problems at all that i could see. the weapon placement is extremely good, i still can't figure out what the hell that button on that sort-of-computer thing that looks more like a overgrown radio (? heh) does, maybe starts up some lasers, dont know. now, this map plays well in teamplay, the layout reminds me of your average TF 2fort map (which most EVERY tf map was like, i cant even count how many of those 2fort clones were made... anyway, enough about TF) this is about all i have to say about this map, there's not much that makes it stand out against your average map, but it does play well, so i recommend this map be run on teamplay servers, but NOT dm servers.

Hey all!!!!! Well, since no one is reviewing this map yet, I think I'll take first crack at it. Complex is another of growing series of teamplay maps usning the "2fort" format made popular by TF. Unfourtunatley the quality of these maps range from crap (Teamassault) to Decent (Dirt) and complex in no exception.

<p>

The basic layout is a lot like the TF classic Well6, two bases facing one another with a sort of "neutral" building in the middle. The bases have two levels. The fields in front of the bases have a few climbing areas and sniper towers. It's also cute to note that there are these lasers that "zap" you if you walk into them. Very cool.

<p>

But unfourtunately the lasers are the only original thing in this level. Quite frankly when I played this map I found it to be very drab and boring. The textures are definitley uninspired and the basic outline is just a rip off of th old "2fort" style. While great for TF i find that in Action, more realistic environments are needed to help create the right atmosphere for Action Quake's squad based teamplay.

<p>

However the thing that killed this map is the gameplay aspect. Where cover is god in this game the map maker decided to keep the areas relatively open, giving you no places to bandage or reload. MP5s and M4s dominate. The strategy element is lost, turning it into a game of "shoot and deliver with an automatic." 

<p>

If this map had a bit more cover, it could've been decent. But unfoutunately Complex becomes anither "2fort" map that doesn't do it for me.
