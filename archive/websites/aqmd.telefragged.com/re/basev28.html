<b>Review:</b><br>

This and Kumanru are definitely my favourite AQ2 maps. Like Kumanru, this map is notable for crisp architechture and uncluttered layout, so none of that getting stuck behind flimsy doors and ugly looking furniture malarkey. The moody lighting in GL mode is very pleasing, simple yet very effective, and the map runs very smoothly on my P2-333 SLI. But then it would,  wouldn't it?

 <p>

The map is large courtyard  with a central bunker. This connects by ramps to a 3rd storey walkway which covers the entire perimeter of the map. Below the walkway are two opposing tower blocks.

   <p>

The best thing about this is that you can see almost the entire level from any point, so there are plenty of oppurtunities to pick off players distracted in fire fights. Snipers heaven.

  <p>

Budding Jackals will also love the extensive of use dark areas, but don't forget that each black spot can be seen from about 10 others. This is the great feature of the level: you're not safe anywhere as you're constantly exposed on almost every flank.

  <p>

There are 3 modes of play: either slug it out for big frags on the courtyard floor(an mp5 in the central bunker is just the thing here), ducking behind the pillars and lamp posts for cover, risking a picking off from the higher tiers; or take up a bird's eye view in the upper tiers and snipe away. Mind, once you've picked someone off they're bound to come for your blood, and if you don't watch your back you'll end up sniped yourself. Thirdly, you can have shoot outs with players right at the other end of the level, ducking behind stacked crates and pillars for cover. Chucking grenades into the hapless hordes below is also a gas.

  <p>

Weapon placement is just fine, but as a casual player the finer points of this elude me. However, what I can say is that THIS is the map I always have the most FUN on. It great with 4-8 players (6 is ideal), but it gets a bit mayhemic with more.<br>

<b>Review2:</b><br>

 I would just like to add some additonal information to Kit's review.  I agree with his review for the most part, but would like to reflect on how well suited this map is for teamplay.  While it's not implemented in code yet, teamplay by skins is SOO much fun in AQ2 that it's usually the only way I play.  The two opposing bases make for ideal "home forts" for the two teams.  While there's no flag to capture, its still a matter of face to defend your own base.  And with teamplay, snipers become all the more deadly.  One of our clanmates, [6e9] Abzorba racked up an amazing 33 kills IN A ROW with him on the sniper rifle and [6e9] Slayer blocking the ladder.  If you dont believe me, the URL for a jpeg of the final score is www.gibbed.com/6e9/abzorba.jpg.

<p>

And the lone-gunman tip, the best area to stay in my opinion is right in the middle, on top of the central bunker.  If you keep moving and aim your shots well, you can dodge past most of the flak thrown at you and take out anyone foolish enough to stand still anywhere on the map. Overall, a great map.

<b>Review3:</b><br>

Well I saw the great reviews for this map and said "Hey these guys got 3d cards. I need to give one from the software point of view." Well, This ones gonna be mixed.<p>

I must agree with the previous reviews and say the this map is tons-o-fun. I especially love to lob those grenades from above on to the crowds of unsuspecting players below. Also, 

A man with a sniper rifle up top in the dark can easily win the level without moving at all. (I myself have done this once) That spot is right next to the spawn spots in the upper corners in the map. Don't start nailing the newly spawned as soon as they show or you will give yourself away.<p>

Sniper wars across the rooftops is fun too. What can I say except for the major flaws about to be described this map cranks.

 Ok now for the bad news. If you play in software mode graphically this map is gonna SUCK!!!! There are MAJOR rendering bugs in this map. For those of you who have made or played a map and noticed doors disappearing this is only the beginning of the problems in this one. not only do doors appear and disappear so do walls. They don't actually

disappear as grey out and when that happens you can FIRE THROUGH THEM!!! yes you heard right. A person playing in software can kill you if he sees you through a "greyed out" wall and he can see you if that wall greys out and your behind it. So all you hardware people have a disadvantage here. So if your on this level alone in the sniper room and you get shot even though your not near a window look on the far rooftops and catwalks for a player. He's running software mode and you can't hide.   

  (For all you "Quake experts" that say that this can't be done remember the bug in qw that allowed people to shoot through walls? It's here too, and in a different form but better rendering could have prevented it on this map)

<p>

 Basically I must say that this map is not very good overall

 Yes the gameplay rocks but you can never know wheather there's someone "cheating" and the person playing in software will have a hard time telling if he is shooting at

someone on this side or the otherside of that wall he's looking at because that wall may not be there for him.

And that really SUCKS!!!
