All I can say is......wow!! This map greatly out does many maps. The detail for the level was great! I mean.... if you have ever paid attention to the buildings! Awesome detail! I like the way sniper spots were set up. I have played this map *many times and get involed in great firefights due to the layout of the city! I do have one problem though... I went into the casino and found a boarded up hallway... I look through and a door is there.... I try to get through but cant... I really wondered what was over there :ï¿½ <p>Though this map is not good for 1-3 players, it is great for 4-7 "fraggers". One more thing about the sniper areas, if you have about 4-5 people on your team you have this one room where you can go upstairs, have a sniper and 2-3 guards guarding a door.. One person can snipe and the others guarding the door! That is a really easy way to get *FREE* frags! And one other thing.. this map is good for "Stonghold" ( a team gets in a building and the other comes to get em ) ;) <p>Well... That really explains it...<br>-Ranger
