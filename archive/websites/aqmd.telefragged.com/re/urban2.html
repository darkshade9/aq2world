  <font face="arial" size="2"><b>Review:</b><br>

  Urban2 is, in my opinion, made for teamplay. I also think it is a vast improvement 

  over the first urban map. Layout: I really liked the layout of the buildings 

  and the accesability to each one. The first urban map tended to turn into a 

  sniper war with access to the roofs of the buildings limited to one route. Urban2 

  overcomes this with multiple routes to rooftops. There is a lot more open windows 

  to shoot from as well. As I mentioned before, this map is ideal for teamplay 

  and will work well for DM too. Textures: The buildings all looked great and 

  I noticed no slowdowns at all. I only did a walkthrough and have not been able 

  to test it with multiple players. Weapons: I found a good amount of weapons 

  and ammo scattered across the map. You will have to be careful to conserve ammo 

  though. I hardly ever play DM, so I really didnt pay that much attention to 

  weapon and ammo placement. Sorry. Overall: I think this map is much better than 

  the first urban map and hope anyone who runs a teamplay server with urban in 

  rotation will replace it with this one. Score: 9/10<br>

<p><font face="arial" size="2"><b>Review:<br>

  </b> Like all good action films, the sniperfest otherwise known as Urban has 

  a sequel. However, your average sequel tends to fall into the disastrous trap 

  of doing the same thing all over again; no sophomore slump for this series. 

  As if scratch-built all over again, Urban2 is a completely new kind of sniperfest, 

  what with almost every single building having convenient windows (along with 

  matching stairs and ladders to reach them - a feature sorely needed in the original 

  Urban). It gets even worse with the dark blue "closing time" shading, giving 

  off a feel of dusk; essentially, snipers can even camp on the ground, and, chances 

  are, you might just pass one right by. But never fear, handcannon users, Urban2 

  isn't the rushing-into-the-open fight that Urban was. The heights of the buildings 

  have been adjusted, so if you screw up a building jump, it's probably not fatal; 

  one is reminded of the infamous leap of faith from the Coke sign.... or why 

  worry about leaps of faith anyways? The buildings are set evenly apart, though 

  not in such a structured manner as to ruin the overall feel of the map. Plus, 

  the beauty of the map, is the overall accessability of every single area... 

  stealth is still very very possible in the map (gl_modulate stimmers aside) 

  and it's much much easier to flank sniper nests with all the new paths you can 

  take. To sum it up, Urban2's still a sniperfest, but a different KIND of sniperfest... 

  one that would most definately bring about more diverse and interesting matches 

  than it's predecessor.... .. pred... .... damn, did I spell that right? ^^;;;; 

  Oh well... :D <br>

<p><font face="arial" size="2"><b>Review:<br>

  </b> Have you ever played Urban and realized you were the last one left on your 

  team, so you went into that room off of the bridge and just waited for someone 

  to open the door? Well then congradulations buddy, Urban 2 is for you! The very 

  first thing you will notice is just how absolutely pitch black dark this board 

  is. Tell me honestly Gerbil!, were you trying to eliminate sniping completly 

  or just didn't want to worry about illegal textures anymore so you obscured 

  it all? Of course, even if you could see, all the buildings are about the same 

  height, so you are limited to a view of the street in front of you. I think 

  this board brings into question a much broader problem: Is it really possible 

  to make a board that can be equally enjoyed in DM as in teamplay? Should maps 

  just be concentrated on one or the other? How many reviews have you seen where 

  people complain about weapon placement on boards that are obviously meant for 

  teamplay? Urban 2 is quite definately a Deathmatch only board, if not a ninja 

  only board. When I tried playing TP, I lost my partner before Action!. Personally, 

  I play Action Quake because of the teamplay option, because that's what really 

  sets it apart from normal quake. And as far as playing Deathmatch on a board 

  like Urban 2, let's just say I gave up playing "Hide and go seek" when I was 

  9. <br>

<p><font face="arial" size="2"><b>Review:<br>

  </b>Well, I'm going to make my review short on this one - since there isn't 

  much new. Urban2 is what I call an "ordinary sequal". It's almost the same map 

  as Urban and with minor changes. If you loved Urban, but was tired of those 

  damn snipers - you're gonna hate this one. Urban2 is very dark, with the same 

  perfect sniper spots as in Urban. This means, if you haven't guessed it, that 

  a skilled sniper with a silencer(my favourite :-) will kick ass on this one. 

  That doesn't mean that this map isn't good. It is well done, and it is clear 

  that it isn't a rookies project, but made by a pro. Textures are ok, but nothing 

  special. The thing that this map scores points on, is architecture. This map 

  is based on a really complex city, like seen in Urban and Chriscity3. And luckely 

  it is also without those locked doors like in Actcity2. This map is good, but 

  personally I find the original better(don't we always). Well, don't take me 

  wrong - here are the scores <br>

  : -------------------| SCORES |------------------<br>

  TEXTURES: 4/10 <br>

<p><font face="arial" size="2"><b>Review:<br>

  </b>I have to say, I've been playin action for quite some time now...seen good 

  maps come, bad maps come....the classic, the 'play-em-once-then-throw-em-away'..seen 

  em all. But urban2 is by far the WORST map I've ever played. I thought the first 

  one was horrible, I just knew I had to put up with it, cause the majority of 

  the people seemed to enjoy it (i sure love those 20 minute rounds too, yippee 

  wowee). But to make a sequel to it, AUGH AUGH AUGH!! I have no CLUE what was 

  going on in the author's mind, but he was either high when he decided to make 

  a second urban, or he's really really dumb... While i was playing, I noticed 

  that if the teams were lucky enough to be placed close together, one team would 

  be annihilated quickly, or a few people would escape (they of course, went off 

  to camp leading to the 20 minute rounds). However, if the teams started fairly 

  far off, you'd be lucky to hear any fighting every 5 minutes. Fire a few rounds, 

  watch him run away, track him down 5 minutes later fire a few more rounds; repeat 

  for 2 hours. Well, I dunno how the mind of a camper works, so maybe there's 

  just lots of em out there, and they really like the map. I think it sucks, and 

  it'll be hard for a map to suck quite as much. Then of course, in deathmatch, 

  the majority of people would go off and find a cozy little corner somewhere, 

  while 2 or 3 people rushed around looking for them hoping to be able to save 

  the dignity of AQ2, they failed. This map is a disgrace, and should be deleted 

  immediately. <br>

<p><font face="arial" size="2"><b>Review:<br>

  </b>Well, this is my first review of a map. Having said that, on with the review. 

  Urban2 is a fairly good map, at leadt technically(Top scores all around there.) 

  The problem is with the flow and gameplay, and weapon balance, and some other 

  stuff. Flow: This map does not flow. In fact, it lacks flow even more than it's 

  predecessor, urban 1, had. all fights basically occur in one spot of the map, 

  just like urban1(and actcity2, and teamjungle, and armyterr,and pretty much 

  every other so called "teamplay" map that's been released lately.) Weapon balance: 

  Well, the map isn't the total sniperfest that urban1 was, at least not in the 

  sense that it was across the level sniping. The sniping spots are just as imposible 

  to get to without getting shot though, and if someone is ladder camping then 

  you might as well forget it. As for the other weapons, it's pretty bleak.. Except 

  in a few confied areas, the automatics and sniper rifle rule this map. The shotgun 

  can take you a little ways, but you'll usually get head shot or sniped before 

  you can use it due to the way the map is laid out(mostly straight, narrow avenues 

  --in other words m4 country.) If you want to use stealth and tactics, this is 

  NOT your map. Layout: The layout of the map is dismal. Not in an asthetic sense, 

  I mean in a gameplay sense. As noted before, the map is ridiculously open(like 

  urban1) and lacks even basic cover, again like urban1. Unfortunatly, this map 

  lacks the wide open dodging room that urban1 had, instead the author has opted 

  for narrow alleyways for the most part. The open areas are almost always overlooked 

  by a sniping spot or two, making crossing them a risky at best and sucicidal 

  at worst situation. Which brings me to my worst quibble with this map: The sniping 

  spots and upper areas in general. Each upper area is accesible only by a roof. 

  To reach these roofs, you usually have to climb a ladder IN PLAIN sight of most 

  of the sniping roosts. Also these roosts usally only have 1 easily watchable 

  entrance, normally a ladder.... What's worse is that a sniper or auto-sniper 

  will find it quite easy to set up camp and watch the ladder without risk to 

  himself in many sections of the level. Just like Urban1, fancy that... Other: 

  The textures used in this level look fairly good. Some of them are inappropriate, 

  like the odd looking grate/window texture found on several of the buildings. 

  Weapon and ammo placement are fairly good, although i found the sniper rifle 

  and mp5 a bit too easy to reach. Verdict: This is the same thing as urban only 

  with more of the crap that made the first one so blasted annoying to play, and 

  not alot of the few things that made the first worth the time. Great DM map, 

  as you will only have 3 losers AT MAX actting like dumbasses. For teamplay, 

  I advise you as follows: AVOID THIS MAP LIKE THE PLAUGE. That is, unless YOU 

  like getting constantly sniped and headshot by guys camping in essentially inaccesible 

  sniper roosts.... <br>

<p><font face="arial" size="2"><b>Review:<br>

  </b>Ahhhh Urban2 a really good map unfortunatly didnt live up to some of my 

  expectations. The map was way to dark making the sniper play on the sequel much 

  harder then the first also there were way to many rooms but on the good side 

  it wasnt that big of a map so it doesn't take so long to find the guy wating 

  and praying for the time limit to hurry.But those are just comments for the 

  teamplay on the other hand this will be one of the better ffa (free for all) 

  maps around. Basically the map consisted of mostly 3 storie block buildings 

  with roof accses and many windows to fire out of,a few lite up with light making 

  you and excelent target if you peered your res dog head out of them. Personaly 

  i feel gerbil tried to hard to put everyones suggestions into urban2 althoug 

  it turned out great it didnt live up to my expectations he should have gone 

  with his gut it worked the first time.But i also no many people who love this 

  map so try it out for yourself and see what you think. <br>

  --MCP-</font></p>

<p><font face="arial" size="2"><b>Review:<br>

  </b>Well, I went into this map as a skeptic, as all reviwers should, mainly 

  because I didn't like Urban. I thought, another city map, another sniper war, 

  but this map is anything but that. Gerbil! finally made it so a lot of the buildings 

  actually have insides to them, which is always a plus for me, kind of a way 

  to duck out of sniper fire and such. This map is fun to play, and go download 

  it now! Structure and Design -8/10- I really really like it when maps have some 

  sort of balance to it. I saw people being sucessful with all kinds of weapon 

  combos, from shotgun/slippers to sniper/kevlar to mp5/silencer. I love being 

  able to have buildings to hide in, so you aren't always out in the wide open. 

  I just think it's funner to shoot people out of windows, then off of roofs all 

  the time, insides to buildings add another dimension to the level. I think Gerbil! 

  delivered, and saw that maybe some people didn't like a wide open map and decided 

  to give the best of two worlds. I love how he did his staircases too, you can 

  sit behind them, and as people run up the stairs you can shoot at them. It actually 

  is quite fun with a shotgun, and you should try it. This map favors all kinds 

  of strategies to it, from Rambos out there, to Campers out there. This suits 

  everyone's playing needs. Lighting -8/10- The only ding is for a tad too much 

  darkness, but hey it's night, so that's forgiveable. I don't have none of that 

  new-fangled 3-d accelerator, so I can't tell you how the colors of light came 

  out at me, but I like the lighting. It had dark areas, and really light areas, 

  and some inbetween, it was jsut really cool. It reminded me of a city street 

  at night when I played it, dark alleys and such. The lighting is believable, 

  and real is this map, not like other maps where light comes out of nowhere, 

  and doesn't give shadows or anything. The lighting overall adds to the map, 

  and doesn't detract from the map at all, which is what it is susposed to do 

  right? Teamplay -8/10- Teamplay was a blast on this map, I almost always play 

  teamplay, and I greatly favor those maps, which don't have two set bases. This 

  map, has so many defensive points in it, and ways to get to someone's back, 

  it requires teams to protect their snipers. Which is always a good feature, 

  to implement in your map. It was fun to play, and that's what matters. Textures 

  -5/10- Didn't like them, they really didn't impress me, like blockwar's or teacher' 

  textures, but the map is a good map anyways. Not so great textures, don't make 

  the map a bad map unless, they are a total eye-sore and don't add to the realism 

  of the map. Ugly textures are fine, if they are for the paint on the walls at 

  a school, but if they are ugly for no reason then it sucks. These maps textures 

  aren't the best in the business, but they work okay and don't hurt my eyes when 

  I see them, so this map is still a great map. Textures aren't that important 

  to gameplay, unless they favor a certain team, by camoflauge or something to 

  that effect. Overall -8/10- My only grievance is the textures, but I didn't 

  let that factor have anything to do with the over all grade. This map is lots 

  of fun, and anyone would enjoy playing it, because it gives adavantages, and 

  disadvantages to all weapons and items. 'Till next time <br>

<p><font face="arial" size="2"><b>Review:<br>

  </b>I really liked the first version of Urban, although it had it's flaws (Ladders 

  that couldn't be descended for example), so when I heard of the new Urban2, 

  I was thrilled. I downloaded it and I tried it out for myself (I haven't tried 

  it on the Internet yet). The ladders were kind aimproved, but some of the really 

  look psyched, and one of the ladders can't be accessed properly. The change 

  of design is quite an improvement otherwise, and it defeninitely looks better 

  than the first Urban, and it is no longer the team which controls the highest 

  roof that wins, but the textures definitely need some work. I get confused and 

  bored by seeing the same texture on all buildings. Another thing that really 

  pisses me off is that when you jump down from one roof to another, it is usually 

  impossible to get back, since the difference in height between the two roofs 

  is just enough. Weapons and ammo placement: The placement of the weapons is 

  quite good, with the sniper rifle in the middle, and in a rather open area so 

  that it will be hard to lay your hands on it. The shotguns play a too small 

  role on the map according to me, since there is simply not enough ammo for them, 

  as opposite to the other weaponry, and especially the sniper rifle. Teamplay: 

  I haven't tried teamply yet, but I think it will be quite nice, since it is 

  not as open for a sniper as Urban, and also the darkness provides some cover.

<p><font face="arial" size="2"><b>Review:<br>

  </b>Now first off, I would like to say that I am a huge fan of the original 

  urban. While some may say things along the lines of "Urban sucks my ass!!", 

  I was always in favor of the classic sniperwar level. When I saw urban2.zip 

  up for grabs at www.mapdepot.net, I grabbed it right away, thinking that a lot 

  of servers would be playing it, considering the original was quite popular. 

  Boy was I wrong. It was almost a week and half after I had downloaded urban2 

  that I actually got to play it on a server. now urban2 is not a bad map by any 

  means, but it is not the best map I have ever played, either. It lacks the "feel" 

  that urban has. In urban, you could sit on a roof and just snipe away, with 

  only a slight chance of some fool climbing up the ladder hoping for a lucky 

  shot.In urban2, however, when sitting on top of a building, there are so many 

  places where people can nail you from, it can be very frustrating. I understand 

  that this is good for the offensive players who dash on top of buildings with 

  their MP5's, and it also discourages camping, but I liked the feel of the old 

  urban better. I have only played this map in Teamplay, so I do not know what 

  weapons placement is like. Also, this map is very dark in some spots (especially 

  corners). While the many spots to kill from discourage camping, these spots 

  encourage it. Despite these flaws, urban2 is a well done map, and maybe I should 

  try something new for a while, such as the MP5, and give up my trusty old SGR3000 

  Sniper Rifle. I think that this map was intentionally made to be more fair to 

  those with the automatic weapons. Great job, Gerbil!, just make sure you lighten 

  up those corners and not make the map so open. I hope that urban3 is great (which 

  it probably will be), and keep up the great work. <br>

<p><font face="arial" size="2"><b>Review:<br>

  </b>This map rules. And it is very sniper friendly (I like snipeing) :) . I'm 

  gona do this review in that Structure and Design - then - Weapon placement - 

  then - ... and so on, style. I will keep my personal comments till last. Structure 

  and Design: Very natural looking and a good city indeed. I like that it's dark 

  (its easy to snipe) :) Weapon placement: Very good placement! I got my sniperrifle 

  just where I want it :). BUT I have heard complaints from both my opponents 

  and teammates about ammo for the M4. Sometimes it just lies there and somebody 

  picks it up just to see that its empty. Gameplay: That is very good to. I like 

  that the ladders are placed, not against the wall (like in Urban). And there 

  is this room... I will talk more about that when I'm finished. Framerates: Isn't 

  any problem here. By the way, I own a PII 400 and a Voodoo2 card :) . The looks: 

  Like I said in struct. & design. It is VERY similar to a real city with officebuildings 

  and stuff. Comments: Now back to that room I was talking about. When I played 

  teams with my friends on the LAN, we always got stuck and blew each other up 

  i a certain room with three windows and 2 stairs leading up to it. First our 

  team held it for a while and then the other team came and cleand the room out, 

  then we came backe and retook it and so it continued... until one smarthead 

  began throwing grenades and you can imagine the massacre. On that day I became 

  very good at knives and gained many frags by throwing those knives in their 

  faces, and I also found a great snipeing point from where you could se that 

  anoying room, it was there I got my bonuspoints "Nechrom recieved 11 frags for 

  his 9th kill in a row" :) . Overall score: +8/10, it looses one point on that 

  stupid room everybody was fighting about. I realy liked this map (for snipeing) 

  :) . <br>

  </b>I would like to comment that Urban2 was a great disappointment. After the 

  hours of fun in teamplay on the Urban map by Gerbil!, I was anxious awaiting 

  his next release. Well.. I got it.. Urban2.. And unfortunately this one is unable 

  to live up to the original. There is simply too many places someone can camp 

  and with the floods of new people coming into the Action realm, this is not 

  a good thing. Im hoping there will be an Urban3 which will surpass the first 

  two in the fun factor, but until then, my vote is on the original Urban. <br>

  </b></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Looks like a great level plays like crap. 

  Seriously I thought i'd love this map, I heard it was dark and i like dark levels. 

  Unless you use shotgun and automatics your totaly screwed on this map, it's 

  automatic city. People say it's good that the rooftops are accesible from most 

  anywhere, they are dead wrong it sucks so bad. I play a sniper most of the time, 

  I go on the rooftops and they run up on my ass i can't do shit to them. Played 

  a match and got 1 kill the whole match caus they kept spawning close and killing 

  me and I had no where to run. Accessibility and the fact that the buildings 

  look to similar make this map suck so so so bad. One, no it doesn't even the 

  game because of the sniper so everyone can get at them. It does however make 

  it impossible to snipe because they can run up on you. One thing in the whole 

  game I DO NOT rely on is my team, hell they all go and get theirselves killed 

  in a fury of fire five seconds into the round so I'm not gonna be looking for 

  them to defend me, so it doesn't make it more of a team match in teamplay and 

  in Deathmatch im sure its at least decent to run around on unless you need to 

  get somewhere specific. In any case im givin this map a 4/10 caus it could be 

  decent at dm but i dun play dm so Im giving it the benefit of the doubt, other 

  wise it'd be a 2 or 3. Hopefully i can learn to live with this map sometime,
