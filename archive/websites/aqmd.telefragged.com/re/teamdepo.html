 <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>The layout of teamdepo was
excellent for teamplay, which is a good thing since teamdepo was designed
only for teamplay according to the author.  For me, this map really conveys
the feeling of an actual place.  The sense of scale is excellent.  There are
basically two open outdoor areas (with cover and some sniper areas) that are
split by a large main building (with good indoor areas).  A team can really
stick together outside and assault the other team with coordinated attacks,
or a team can split up and go inside the building in small room clearing
groups.  The overhead wires outside are cool and add some good variation in
routes.</FONT><P>

 <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>At first I thought teamdepo was
kind of plain, but then I thought of the local armory in my town and how it
looks (pretty plain and utilitarian).  So considering the theme, it looks
good.  There are enough texture variations so as not to be boring, and the
place DOES look like some sort of military supply center (the crates
actually make sense in this map!).  I think the theme is conveyed pretty
good.</FONT><P>

 <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Gameplay Comments:</B><BR>Here's where this map really
shines.  I first played it several weeks ago when a clan was testing it on a
server and I jumped in (I've been waiting for its release ever since).  I
had more fun in teamplay on this map than I have had in a long time.  At
first I thought it was going to be another actcity2 (which isn't bad, just
seems like a rusher map), but then we got into a few room hunts and were
also able to pull some end runs (surprise!) on the other team since the map
is so well laid out.  Good variation.  In short, a blast to play.  All
weapons users will feel at home in this map.</FONT><P>
 <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Ambiance Rating:</B> 9/10</FONT><BR>
 <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Ambiance Comments:</B><BR>Really good night feeling, with
cricket sounds and a small water area complete with frog sounds.  I actually
do read the text files on authors' maps, so I caught the wolves near the
water towers (a nice touch).  Not too dark outside (but dark enough), and
the inside of the main building has good lighting.  I really like the second
floor room in one of the detached buildings (the one with the fluorescent
light overhead) -- makes you feel like sniping.  :)</FONT><P>
 <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Other Comments:</B><BR>The author says not to play this in
DM (there aren't even any weapons) because it's for teamplay only.  I would
have liked some weapons in DM to at least try it out, but oh well.  It's so
good for teamplay that I can easily overlook the DM omission.</FONT><P>
 <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>Get this map.  I hope teamplay servers
run it, because we need some good new teamplay maps that actually play well.
So many of these new "teamplay" maps look great but play like shit.
Fortunately, teamdepo is a map that plays great and still looks
decent.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Architecture Comments:</B><BR>I like this layout, the little cute creek, and the little buildings, auuuu!!! So Cute! But really, this layout was cool, but it could have been better. Maybe a big builing with like a looker room and stuff like that.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" SIZE=2><B>Looks Comments:</B><BR>I thought this map looked like crap, but If you think abbout it, places like this are not supposed to Colorful, so i give it a 7, even for a armory its ugly. It wasnt as bad as some maps (e.g. Submarine).</FONT><P>
