  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Okay, the layout was NOT bad... Though NOTHING like a real submarine. I don't 

  know where KB gets off thinking you have that much room in a sub. it's also 

  just plain hell trying to maneuver throughout the level. The ladder ports are 

  to small, and so you spend precious time trying to duck down a ladder, meanwhile, 

  someone's popping shells into your skull. Doesn't exactly leave you leaping 

  with joy. Oh, and you can't fall off the sub, which, I think, would've have 

  been a neat addition. </font>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  I have ONE thing to say. BORING! and NOTHING like a sub! First of all, that's 

  ONE DAMN BIG SUB! Most subs are CRAMPED at best, with minimal living space! 

  Lack of textures also doesn't make this sub very nice to look like either... 

  I'd guess that over the majority of the sub, 4-5 textures were used! </font>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  I died too much trying to climb ladders, and that wasn't very fun. Also, when 

  you get outside, it's a bitch trying to find out how to get back in. And even 

  if you know, chances are, someone's going to shoot you while you're trying. 

  (I suceeded in getting back in alive once of the nine times I tried) </font>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Now this is ONE thing that the sub has. Maybe some added sound effects would 

  have been nice, but all in all, the mood is fine. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  A sub really isn't a map that should be made for AQ2. A real sub (and we are 

  going for some reality here) is very cramped, whereas AQ2 demands at least a 

  LITTLE space, and with a sub, there is no compromise, so, while this is a good 

  idea, it was doomed to failure from the start. </font>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  I didn't like the layout of this map much. The first time I played it is was 

  on the outside and it took me like 5 minutes just find the enterance and then 

  it took me another five to get down the ladder so I could get in. Throughout 

  the map I kept finding the ladders annoying. When your being chased you don't 

  feel like running around a ladder that's blcking your path (which are way to 

  skinny in the first place). Also there are absolutely no places to get a good 

  sniping position. </font>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  Most of the textures are bland. The whole outside of the sub was one color. 

  The best looking places were the engine room (or whatever the room with the 

  red flashing lights was) and the control room. The rest of the sub was very 

  bland and could have used more textures. Overall I think that this make could 

  have used some more textures. </font>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  I didn't find trying to manuver around the map easy. This let me to many problem 

  with getting killed way to easily and that is definatly not fun. If the corridors 

  were a little more spacious, and there where fewer doors in that one hall, then 

  there could be some fun shootouts. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Ambiance score</b> 8/10 <br>

  <b>Commentary:</b><br>

  There was a definate mood throughout the sub. There are small halls everywhere 

  and dark areas everywhere. I think that the mood was one of the stronger points 

  of this map. </font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Conclusion:</b><br>

  I think that this map has some good potential but needs some fixin. Hopefully 

  there will be a better sequel that gives you a little more room. I can't wait.
