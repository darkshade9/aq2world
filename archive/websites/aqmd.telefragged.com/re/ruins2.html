<b>Review:</b><br>

Right off the bat, this is still one of the coolest. I still love the idea of the two buildings and attempting to jump from one side to the other. But was disappointed that it was cut down some. I liked the crumbled building that used to be in there. That was one of the best. Ok so it lagged things a little but it's still cool. 

<p>

Ammo wasn't that difficult to find but it felt more difficult to find guns. I liked where the sniper rifle was though because it was placed perfectly for sniper (almost). 

<p>

Ok, now for the bad (I'm gonna make myself famous for critising maps!). I think Runitai should go back and optimize the level. Or at least line up the walls. The fact that they're not lined up is creating excess polys. Then it's a matter of lining up textures as well (this can be a pain). Also the texturing in some places becomes repetitive. 

<p>

It is inspiring to know though that I helped encourage sequels to maps. But I thought they were supposed to be bigger and better? This was a disappointment in that area.

<p>My rating: 6/10

<b>Review:</b><br>

 I didn't like ruins1 at all. Horrible lighting, too many dark areas. But when I tried this, I was surprised, positively. Some great improvements. There's some sewers below the ground, the courtyard has been replaced with building, so it runs faster. This is very nice. There are some flaws though. Lighting is still too bright. And too dark. Outside, it's someplaces way too bright, and when you go inside, or to the sewers, it's way too dark. I don't like when you have to look for the exit by runing against the walls. Reduce the lighting outside, some brighter inside areas, and this would rock. And when you don't see, you don't know if there's a M4 clip right before you. But there's enough ammo. What I think is, that this map is still under construction for the lighting.

<b>Review:</b><br>



After seeing some screenshots of this map, I found the textures boring and Quake look-alike. After spending 2 minutes playing the map without other players I agreed with my meanings after the pictures - boring! So I wasn't too excited when the server I was playing on changed level to ruins2. When I got started, I was pleased over the fact of that I was playing teamplay(it's my favourite), but after 10 seconds of intense teamplay, this map touched my heart.<p>

It was great fun, and due to its size - it gave me 110% action all the time. Even a 2 on 2 teamplay game wont stop the intense gaming Action Quake II is so famous for. But I give you a warning, TEAMPLAY ONLY!<p>

--- SCORES ---<br>



GAMEPLAY: 9/10<br>

FRAMRATE: 10/10<br>

TEXTURES: 6/10<br>

DEATHMATCH: 2/10<br>

TEAMPLAY: 10/10<br>

<br>

OVERALL: 8/10

<b>Review:</b><br>

This is my second review. Yes I'm reviewing an older map, why you ask? Because I want to. Now I really liked this map too because of the basic layout which is what I play in when I go paintballing. As for framerate I get an excellent one mostly in part of my 133 with 48 megs of ram and an 8 meg monster 2 :P. Weapons layout is a bit sketchy tho I in part dont like where the shotgun is placed (my fav gun) its where everyone can get it if they know where it is same with the other guns but easier to get at. The thing Im annoyed with is that sound I hear when i get on that one building the beige one that you need to get on to get on the gray building that is connected by a wooden plank to the red building. Its really weird and whenever I hear it I get scared because usually everyone is dead even the entire other team! Oh well enuff of me babbling. Grab the map I give it a generous 9 outta 10
