I updated the FAQ, Staff page, fixed all broken links on every page that I could find, did a little house cleaning, and other tedious things.

The thing that makes this so interesting is that well known AQ2 mapper, WetWired (author of Tequila, Beer(series), Matrix2 and more) has made several maps for this new game. An example of one of his maps for <a href="http://www.4drulers.com/gore" target="_blank">Gore</a> is the rooftop action building. <br><br><a href="http://www.4drulers.com/gore/sshots/gore2404c.php" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.4drulers.com/gore/sshots/gore2404c_thumb.jpg"></a><br><br>WetWired became famous once again, letting his talents have a go at the Quake3 mod, <a href="http://www.urbanterror.net" target="_blank">Urban Terror</a>. The results were stunning and his maps are still one of the best yet. His talents combined with more AQ2 strength (old AQMDer, Oswald, AQ2 mapper NRGizeR and BBQ) makes <a href="http://www.urbanterror.net" target="_blank">Urban Terror</a> one of the most popular mods ever.<br><br>Now let's see how Gore will end up in public, with again, Wetwired's talents!<br><br>I'd also like to give a shoutout to smurphster's and Black Monk's <a href="http://www.actiongames.co.uk/tnn/" target="_blank">Newbies Niche</a>, for having frequent AQ2 updates!

And it should.. they're all fantastic! <br><br>EdMcVinny started a simple server wich only runs the mapping contest maps in rotation! It's not a very fast server, but it should at least be fun to play these maps on a server, since there aren't many servers out there, that have been updated with the new maps. <br><br>Check out his server at: <b>simpledivx.sytes.net:3306</b><br><br>And for all those other server admins out there, take McVinny as an example, go run those new maps!<br><br>Another thing I'd like to shout out, is a re-mod of AQ2 called, <a href="http://aq2u.cjb.net" target="_blank">AQ2 Unleashed</a>. Basicly it's a modification of the original AQ2, wich improves the graphics of the game quite a bit! Here's a little bit:<br><br><i>AQ2 Unleased is a project im working on to spice up your local aq2 for a more update graphic/game standard. It features 16-bit and 32-bit colours, geometric shadows, reflections (similar to whats seen in games such as Quake 3, Soldier Of Fortune, etc). Set your own view distance as far as you wish for those maps where view distance gets chopped, updated with 16 bit and 32 player models and skins, including weapons and items. Is Unleashed slowing down your gameplay? Add some fog with renders from the Quake3 Engine fog (otherwise it works fine with decent pc's with a good cpu, video card and ram). Set your own decal limit with blood splats, and also set the view distance for decals to where they dissapear and come into view again. Being able to stain maps with blood splats and not have them dissapear like gibs in TNG. 3D models hud, no more icons. Transparent console, Windows XP mouse acceleration disabled (can be enabled if you wish). FPS display.. and more which I am currently working on.</I><br><br>Go check out WareFac's website at <a href="http://aq2u.cjb.net" target="_blank">http://aq2u.cjb.net</a><br><br>Seeya soon guys!<br><br><a href="mailto:nofear@niteshade.net">No Fear</a></font></p><hr>

I moved stuff asside to rate the great map submissions and enjoy the contest period throughout my busy shedule.<br><br>Let me first say a <b>big thanks</b> to those who put effort into making a spankin' new map for AQ2! My reviews of the last three map submissions are as following:<br>-------------------------<br><br>4th Place:<br><br><b>Author</b>: Sabotuer<br><b>Map Title</b>: Building Site<br><br>A large building under construction, can you imagine the fun you'll have there? Imagine this, Sabotuer textured this map very nicely, simple and effective and very good looking! This added with a nice touch of lightning, and an amazing detail spent to gameplay, this map is great fun!   <br>-------------------------<br><br>5th Place:<br><br><b>Author</b>: GreyDeath<br><b>Map Title</b>: Sky Scraper<br><br>GreyDeath here made a very tall Sky Scraper at a construction site, much like the above Building Site, this is a map built for careful tactics and great fun! Texture use is very good but the amount of fun you can have on this map, overwhelmes it. Even though the r_speeds are pretty high, you'll find this map being much bigger than you'll first expect! And it's not just the sky scraper under construction that takes your attention, you'll have plenty of fun at the ground as well. With obstacles and places to hide in, this map is big fun with enough players!<br>-------------------------<br><br>6th Place:<br><br><b>Author</b>: WaZZuP!<br><b>Map Title</b>: Doughnut of Death<br><br>A map purely based on fun and tactics! You'll notice while playing this map it isn't all about the looks, it's about the fun and testing your opponents skills. Test your jumps, survive the wrath of traps and while concentrating on the tough obstacles, kill the enemy as well! Great fun, if you play it with more than 1 people ;)<br>-------------------------<br><br>Many thanks again, to those contributing to AQ2. Thanks for the submissions.. and we're looking forward to any future work, whether this is AQ2 related or not, you can always ring Idle's tool.. uh.. ring a bell. <br><br>Best wishes,<br><br><a href="mailto:nofear@niteshade.net">No Fear</a><br><i>1st Grade Udder Sucking Duck</i></font></p><hr>
