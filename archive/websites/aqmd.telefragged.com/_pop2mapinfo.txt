  These are the most popular Official Action Quake 2 maps as of 6/10/2000.  
  These encompass the top 23 Teamplay maps and the top 23 Deathmatch maps 
  not already included in the first "popular map PAK" as determined by how 
  often the maps have been played.  These were all gathered from the Action 
  Quake Map Depot.  There are 181 official maps total as of this writing.

  RAR or ACE would compress better but I don't know if 
  *nix users can uncompress these kind of files.


  Installation:

  Simply uncompress this ZIP file into your Quake2 directory.
  If there is a PAK file named "pak3.pak", then you better copy it 
  to a different name or another place lest it gets overwritten.
