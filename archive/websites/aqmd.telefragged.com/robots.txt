<span class="author">By Jeff Buckland, 8/3/2013 2:58 AM</span><br/><br/>
<p>Earlier today, Sony Online finally showed us a good chunk of <b>EverQuest Next</b>, the MMO they've been working on for years.  <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/everquestnext/c/2681754">Twitch has a recording</a> of the stream done from the SOE Live event in Vegas.  It's good stuff, but I do still have some doubts...<br/><br/>

<h3><a href="/news/4170/irrational-announces-new-bioshock-infinite-dlc">Irrational Announces new BioShock Infinite DLC</a></h3>
<span class="author">By Jeff Buckland, 7/30/2013 9:46 AM</span><br/><br/>
<p>What was your favorite thing about <b>BioShock Infinite</b>?  What's most memorable to you?  Did the answer to either question have anything to do with the combat?  If so, you'll like Irrational's first DLC, called Clash in the Clouds, which was finally announced and will be released... today.  (Yep, simultaneous announcement and release.)  It's only $5 which is a welcome change - 2K does usually carefully price their DLC - but after the sale of a Season Pass followed by months of silence on what the first DLC would be, I'm pretty sure plenty will be disappointed by this.  <br />
<br />

<br />
But there's more that's apparently coming later this year, and it's more of what you were probably hoping for.  Just watch the trailer.<br />

<h3><a href="/news/4169/xbox-one-eighty-part-two-self-publishing">Xbox One Eighty Part Two: Self Publishing</a></h3>
<span class="author">By Jeff Buckland, 7/24/2013 2:06 PM</span><br/><br/>
<p><a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/07/24/microsoft-to-announce-indie-self-publishing-new-certification-process.aspx">GameInformer</a> has word that Microsoft is changing their policy regarding indie games: now, like Steam on PC and Sony with their PlayStation platforms, they'll allow indie developers to publish their own games directly on Xbox One without finding a publisher or being forced to take on Microsoft themselves as publisher (who demands things like timed exclusivity - ask <b>Fez</b> developer Phil Fish or <b>Super Meat Boy</b>'s Team Meat how well that went).  But is this enough?  <br />
<br />
<b>Updated</b>: It's been confirmed by MS along with word that all Xbox Ones will also work as what those in the game industry call "devkits", which until this point, were specialized versions of the console that could run pre-release code which facilitates new games development.

<span class="author">By Jeff Buckland, 7/18/2013 6:54 PM</span><br/><br/>
<p>We get lots of requests from developers trying to fund their game on Kickstarter, but I only post about the ones I really dig, and this is one I quite like: <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stonewardens/stone-wardens-action-rpg-meets-tower-defense?ref=card">Stone Wardens</a>.  They're well short of their funding goal, but I think the mix of tower defense and action with almost an <b>Okami</b>-like art style is really cool.  Check it out and pledge something if you're interested! <br />

<h3><a href="/news/4167/nintendo-blocks-smash-bros-streaming-from-evo-updated">Nintendo Blocks Smash Bros Streaming from EVO [Updated]</a></h3>
<span class="author">By Jeff Buckland, 7/9/2013 6:18 PM</span><br/><br/>
<p>It was bad enough that Nintendo started using its copyright muscle to take Let's Play video makers' YouTube money away from them - literally taking lunch money from their own fans in some cases - but today they really kicked fans in the jimmy.  Fans raised nearly $100,000 for charity to make <b>Super Smash Bros. Melee</b> (the decade-old GameCube game, not even the latest one) the 8th main tournament game at the world's biggest yearly fighting game tournament, EVO.  And Nintendo just informed the tournament organizers that they can't stream it, only 3 days from the event.  As a result, <a href="http://shoryuken.com/2013/07/09/changes-to-evo-2013-smash-schedule/">the event schedule has changed</a> to give more stream time to <b>Persona 4 Arena</b> and <b>King of Fighters XIII</b>.  I'm sure that some fans of those two games will be happy to hear more tourney spots for their favorite games will be shown, I doubt they're really happy how it happened.  <br />
<br />
<b>Update</b>: Nintendo has relented and the Smash streams will go on.  What even got them to the point of saying no in the first place, along with their previous overzealous protection of their property at the cost of fan promotion, shows that Nintendo still has a real problem with understanding their fanbase and that this might not be the last we hear of such issues.<br />

<span class="author">By Jeff Buckland, 7/9/2013 2:57 PM</span><br/><br/>
<p>Rockstar has released a new trailer for <b>Grand Theft Auto V</b>. It might seem like the calm voice explaining gameplay is relatively new, but Rockstar did this in similar videos for <b>Max Payne 3</b> as well.  Anyway, the game looks to be chock full of the huge range of activities that <b>GTAIV</b> lacked (but we expected after <b>San Andreas</b>), all with an even more improved game engine running on current-gen hardware.  They didn't really show us much regarding the size of the world, but we've heard it's bigger than the last couple of Rockstar games combined, so I'd love to see them do a trailer showing off this scale and even more locations.  (It'd also fall in with their usual policy of purposely trying not to spoil a bunch of the game's features and plotlines before the release date.)<br />

<span class="author">By Jeff Buckland, 7/8/2013 9:00 AM</span><br/><br/>
<p>A new trailer for <b>Brutal Doom</b> v1.9 has been released, and a release date has been set: 8/9/2013.  Which is either August 9th if the creator's in the US, or September 8th if he's in Europe.  Not sure which.  My favorite part of this mod is that it doesn't try to reinvent the game with high-quality 3D models, and instead uses tons of great, new 2D sprites for many new animation frames that fit in perfectly with the original art.<br />

<p><a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/jimquisition/7630-Launch-Splooge">Jim Sterling's Inquisition</a> makes a great argument against large launch libraries for games.  He says that mashing two-dozen games together to all be released at once creates confusion, makes the lesser-known titles disappear in the mix, and leaves publishers and console manufacturers struggling in the couple of months to follow to keep the steady stream of quality games coming.  <br />

I agree, but there's more.  <br/><br/>

<p><a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-06-26-microsoft-no-longer-charges-developers-to-patch-their-xbox-360-games">Eurogamer has word</a> that Microsoft, who has had a long-running policy to charge developers tens of thousands of dollars to issue a patch for their games - presumably originally under some kind of well-meaning intent to push developers towards getting their games right the first time, rather than shipping a broken game then patching - has rescinded the policy.  <b>Update</b>: Phil Fish has put out a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rQJyhQZ.jpg">series of tweets</a> on the matter as well as MS' other mistakes on publishing his game (earliest one at the bottom, so read from bottom-up).

<p><a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/26/4466744/crackdown-xbox-one-reveal-event-wasnt-accidental">Polygon got word</a> that the <b>Crackdown</b>-themed easter egg at Microsoft's E3 press conference - which I'll admit I didn't even see, despite enjoying the first <b>Crackdown</b> immensely - wasn't an accident.  MS' own Phil Spencer was also seen in a <b>Crackdown</b> shirt last week on Jimmy Fallon.  Does this mean a new game in the franchise is in the works?  Seems likely. Don't hold out too much hope for Realtime Worlds being the developer of this, one, though; the studio closed up shop years ago.  Doesn't mean they can't come back, but it doesn't seem terribly likely. <br/><br/>

If you're about to look at your calendar, yes, that really a delay one day before the release.  Apparently it's a component made by a third party that Nvidia is suddenly unhappy with, so they're replacing that part in all units. <br/><br/>

This also axes the ability to run a game without a disc in the drive and that whole family sharing thing - which admittedly was a cool feature, but it was overshadowed by the other limitations.<br />

<p>Turn 10 just ran a quick livestream on Microsoft's Twitch.tv channel for <i>Forza Motorsport 5</i>, and for those serious racing fans that stuck with the <i>Forza</i> games through thick and thin, they didn't get a lot of great news.  Open wheeled cars: in, but they're not announcing which ones, so I think that means only specific models - maybe the Ariel Atom or some Caterhams, and the like.  And when the chat repeatedly pestered them about night racing or inclement weather?  The answer was "no".  Support for those expensive, existing <i>Forza</i> branded Fanatec wheels from less than two years ago?  Nope.  Let's dig into some of this, shall we?<br/><br/>

<h3><a href="/news/4155/tekken-revolution-goes-free-to-play-on-tuesday">Tekken Revolution Goes Free-to-Play - On Tuesday!</a></h3>
<span class="author">By Jeff Buckland, 6/8/2013 2:43 PM</span><br/><br/>
<p>Namco has just released a trailer announcing <b>Tekken Revolution</b>, a new free-to-play game in their long-running fighting franchise.  It's coming to PS3 exclusively, and here's the big one: it will be released <b>this Tuesday</b>.  Yep, it has been announced a mere three days before launch.  The idea with a F2P fighting game is generally that a relative few characters are unlocked at the beginning, with the ability to fight <i>against</I> anyone on the roster, and then you can pay a few bucks to unlock new playable characters permanently, possibly with costumes also being a premium thing. Otherwise, some kind of <b>League of Legends</b>-style model of rotating the free playable characters in and out might apply. <br />
<br />
 We'll see if that actually pans out as something gamers gravitate towards, or whether they reject it and would rather go the full-price route.  I think this will be fairly successful, but with this always-connected perspective, what will it mean for tournaments?  After all, many fighting game players look to the top-level players that are constantly competing in the world's biggest online-streamed tournaments, and if this F2P model can't be adapted to work in a tourney scenario, it may not take off.  <br />

<span class="author">By Jeff Buckland, 6/6/2013 6:49 PM</span><br/><br/>
<p>It seems that since a couple of weeks ago, Microsoft been quickly scrambling to bang out what was clearly an unfinished set of policies regarding how game licensing will work on the Xbox One, and now they have some answers.  <a href="http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/license">This post</a> on Xbox.com has their rather complex, but what I think will be pretty fair policy: yes, games are linked to your account now when you buy them at a store (or online), and yes, you'll have to deal with Xbox servers to transfer it - whether to let someone else play it temporarily or to lend or sell it.  Here's the thing: publishers are the ones that can choose (or refuse) to charge money for sale of the game license to a retailer - and yes, it's the license, not the disc.  The disc only carries the data and does not confer ownership. Read on for more...<br />

<p>Xbox's Major Nelson has <a href="http://majornelson.com/2013/06/06/more-details-about-xbox-one-controller/">posted</a> a good chunk of info on the changes going into the Xbox One controller.  There are a ton of improvements, including an internal AA battery bay, better sound quality, infrared communication with Kinect that allows the game to do things like swap your split screens automatically if players move around or swap places, and either wired or wireless connectivity that is switchable by simply plugging in (or unplugging) the controller with a mini-USB cable.  All of this seems to have been done with the Xbox 360 fanbase's love for that controller in mind.  Even if the hype train is a little more on the PS4's side right now, this controller still looks like a solid piece of hardware. <br />
<br />
Also, the Back and Start buttons have been renamed to View and Menu.  Does this mean a new standard for putting camera-swapping on that button?  Kind of seems like it, but I think I'd rather Microsoft not insist that that button only do that.  <br/><br/>
