  RAR or ACE would compress better but I don't know if 
  *nix users can uncompress these kind of files.


  Installation:

  Simply uncompress this ZIP file into your Quake2 directory.
  If there is a PAK file named "pak2.pak", then you better copy it 
  to a different name or another place lest it gets overwritten.
