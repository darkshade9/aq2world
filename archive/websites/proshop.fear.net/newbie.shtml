        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Welcome to the wide world
        of Action Quake, where you get to be the star in your own melodrama
        about love, hate, revenge and slo-mo gunfights. Here is a game
        where you can unleash all of your pent-up aggressions without
        winding up in the big house.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Let us get right down to
        it. I'll assume that you have downloaded the AQ2 Client Pack
        from </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><A HREF="http://action.telefragged.com/"
        TARGET="_blank">action.telefragged.com</A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffffff"
         FACE="Arial">, and then bopped over to </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><A
        HREF="http://www.mapdepot.net/">www.mapdepot.net</A></FONT><FONT
         COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> to grab the two map packs as well
        as the multiplayer pack. Additionally, I'll assume you have correctly
        installed these files and packs into your \quake2 setup, and
        you're now wondering how you do things like open doors, create
        custom config files, and in general just style like the man.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Fist off, let me point
        out that every Q2 mod, including the original Q2 game, has a
        game directory in your \quake2 directory. For the original game
        the directory is \baseq2, while for Action Quake it is \action.
        Each of these directories contain the files, images, models,
        and maps for that particular mod. Note also that the /baseq2
        directory is a &quot;default&quot; directory, which means that
        any mod will also look in that directory for resources that it
        needs.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Every mod will have its
        own config.cfg file in it's base directory. This file details
        all of the default setup and key binding information. Unless
        a particular mod installs it's own config.cfg, the file is copied
        from your /baseq2 directory the first time the mod is run. If
        your config for a mod every gets totally screwed, just erase
        it and start the mod again, and a fresh config file will be copied
        from your /baseq2 directory. Of course, if your config in \baseq2
        is screwed that is a problem.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Putting your key binds
        in your config.cfg file is unnecessary though, and you should
        in general refrain from modifying the config.cfg. Especially
        since certain utilities like to rearrange the config.cfg like
        crazy. The best way to set up key binds and aliases is in a file
        called autoexec.cfg. This file should be in the base directory
        of the mod it is for, just like the config.cfg file. When loading,
        the mod will first load your config.cfg then load your autoexec.cfg.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">There are a lot of console
        commands (console is reached using the &quot;~&quot; key) and
        actions that can be bound using aliases and key binds. I will
        not detail them all since there are already several places this
        information can be found. Specifically, you can find console
        command information about all Id games at </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><A
        HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/console/" TARGET="_blank">www.planetquake.com/console/</A></FONT><FONT
         COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> and can find beginner's information
        about setup and configuration at </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><A
        HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/deathmatch101/" TARGET="_blank">www.planetquake.com/deathmatch101/</A></FONT><FONT
         COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> ... this last url even gives info
        on how to use gamespy if you're having trouble in that department.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Information about installing
        map packs, skin packs, and such can be found at the home pages
        dedicated to that area. The button bar along the top of this
        page gives you many links and resources to help you out. Further
        information can be garnered by asking questions on the message
        boards... although silly questions that you can find answers
        to by a little searching will often be ridiculed. Try not to
        be a llama by being too lazy to at least attempt to search out
        the information for yourself first.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Last but not least, you
        should read the information and teamplay sections on this page
        if you're a brand new player, as well as checking through the
        text-file documentation that is installed in the \action directory
        by the client install.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">If you have read all this
        material you should be well on your way to some action-packed
        nights of frantic AQ2. Go forth and discover the joys of sniping,
        sneaking, and spraying. (That last sentence dedicated to the
        &quot;1-clip coterie.&quot;)</FONT></TD>
