        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Verdana">When I play on teamplay
        servers, I use the lasersight, and don't need to use any additional
        crosshairs. But when I play DM, I would like to use one of the
        crosshairs in Your Crosshair1.zip. The problem is that I can't
        load the .pak file containing the crosshairs when running Q2.
        ( I have renamed the file as told in the crosshair.txt (I call
        it pak7.pak).)<BR>
<BR>
        If I type &quot;exec pak7.pak&quot; in the console, the reply
        goes: &quot;execing pak7.pak.... - unknown command PACK&quot;<BR>
<BR>
        Of course, I can just restart the game, with the pak7.pak file
        in the action directory, but since I also have two different
        config-files for teamplay and DM, I would like to be able to
        switch between the two just using the console. Is this possible,
        and if so, how?<BR>
<BR>
        Could you also tell me what program that is used for making crosshairs.</FONT></TD>

        <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Pak files are not executed... they are
        extenstions of the Q2 directory structure in packed (compressed)
        form. As such, any file named PAK0.PAK through PAK9.PAK will
        be automatically loaded at boot time. Having the pak file in
        the \baseq2 directory will affect Q2 and all mods, while having
        it just in the \action directory will only affect the AQ2 mod.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">I have re-released the crosshairs I did,
        but I have cut them down to the most usable ones. You will find
        this in the files section for download. However, creating your
        own crosshairs is quite easy, and can make your screenshots pretty
        interesting. (Mr Clark left some "Mr Clark Cam" crosshairs that I created
        to do screenshots for the Pro Shop.)</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">You can find scads of crosshairs for
        Q2 at <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/rjdriver/bullseye.htm">Bullseye</A>,
        as well as some additional info on editing crosshairs. Basically,
        all you need is Pak Explorer and a decent image editor. Pak files
        work just like Zip files, and have embedded directory structure.
        Make sure you examine how the three crosshairs are stored and
        then begin editing the PCX files to your heart's content. Be
        sure you do not change the palette, as Q2 has very specific colors
        it uses. Also, color index 255 (the last color in the palette)
        is used as the transparency color.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Note that only CH1.PCX, CH2.PCX and CH3.PCX
        are used as crosshairs, any other numbers will be ignored. Also,
        Pak files are included ascending numerically, so if you have
        two crosshair paks loading, the one with the higher number will
        be the one you get in the game.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">I use <A HREF="files/pakexplr.zip" TARGET="_top">Pak
        Explorer</A> and Corel Photo-Paint 8.0, but almost any other
        image editor will work.</FONT></TD>

        <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Here is the command you have been looking
        for... it is the command line option to run the server in dedcated
        console-only mode.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#000057" FACE="Verdana">quake2 +set dedicated
        1 +set game action +set deathmatch 1</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The important part is the &quot;+set
        dedicated 1&quot; which forces Q2 to load in text-based console
        mode. Running a server any other way is simply not a terribly
        good idea. You can also add a +exec parameter to force it to
        load a certain config file on startup.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">You will find a complete list of the
        console commands on the Q2 pages I have linked in the newbie
        section. There are already an awful lot of AQ2 servers out there,
        so don't expect a sudden rush of players to a newly staked out
        server from the get go.</FONT></TD>
