        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Actually, this is one Quake2
        mod where I don't mind people who try to camp and snipe... as
        a matter of fact it's awfully fun to have the occasional sniper
        messing up the countryside with long range attacks. The limitation,
        of course, is the amount of ammo that a sniper can carry, the
        accuracy rules causing the sniper rifle itself to be the sniper's
        weapon of choice, and, of course, the fact that you never heal
        in this mod, which makes sitting still a very different proposition
        than it does in other forms of Quake2.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">I learned pretty early
        on that it is very hard to be a full-time sniper who only lives
        to nab the sniper rifle and hole up in some darkened loft with
        long-range larceny in his heart. The major problem is that playing
        over the internet causes enough lag or choppiness to make it
        quite hard to hit anyone at range. Well, at least I suffer from
        that problem... of course, I'm stuck way out in Montana, so I
        might suffer from more latency than your average schmoe.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">So, the trick is to find
        a nice hidey-hole which is close to a vantage point. What I mean
        by this is that you need a location close to where people come
        up and stop to look around... with a favorite place being an
        overlook or ledge of sorts. Our fearless sniper simply must wait
        for silly folks to come up to that tantalizing spot and stop
        for a look around, then pop the poor soul in the back with his
        trusty rifle. Strangely enough, if someone is close by and doesn't
        see your hiding spot, they tend to run up to the same spot to
        look down at the body... which, of course, leads to a second
        body joining the first.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">The problems with this
        lovely train of thought are many, the primary of which is that
        many wary professionals only linger on the edge a moment before
        moving on. I don't know how many times my ripe sniper shot whistled
        through empty air just inches from the target because I fired
        with a quarter-second of lag time over the net connection...
        and they decided to start moving in the meantime.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Then the other parts of
        the problem with sniping rear their ugly head. The best way to
        snipe is with a silencer/flash supressor attached to your weapon,
        otherwise several bad things happen at once. The first of which
        is usually your target spotting the big flash from your rifle,
        then proceeding to chase down your ass while you're trying to
        get out of scope view. The other problem is that the sniper rifle's
        distinctive sound will indicate to your target that you cannot
        defend yourself very well... which, as above, leads to your ass
        being shot full of lead as the enemy runs up and pistol-whips
        you at point blank.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Finally, there is the fact
        that most good sniping locations are pretty obvious, which means
        that people will look there first to see if someone is being
        a sneaky bastard. I don't know how many times I've nailed people
        who decided to take to the overlooking towers in Prison76...
        don't they realize how exposed they are up there?</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">This is all part of the
        reason why I feel this mod is so fun and so well balanced...
        no-one really minds if someone tries to camp out and snipe for
        a while, because there is no way to dominate the game by doing
        so.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">And now, for a brief departure
        from game playing... I want to enter a brief technical discussion
        on the silencer and the flash supressor. For those that don't
        know what these are really designed for, a silencer is designed
        to completely silence the gasses venting from the end of the
        barrel of a weapon, while a flash supressor is merely meant to
        contain the flash of incandescent gasses that are carrying the
        projectile out of the muzzle of the gun.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Sound waves propogate through
        the air at 1130 feet per second under normal conditions and pressures.
        Any object that travels faster than the speed of sound will create
        a sonic boom, and the path of the projectile itself will be sort
        of a &quot;continual sound&quot; that starts from the muzzle
        of the barrel and terminates at the impact point of the bullet.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">As is indicated on the
        information page of this site, the H&amp;K MP5/10 and the Sig
        Sauer SSG 3000 both shoot a bullet faster than the speed of sound,
        which means that attaching a silencer to the end of either of
        these weapons would quiet the explosion of gasses from the muzzle
        quite a bit, but could do nothing to quiet the supersonic crack
        of the projectile as it passes through the air.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">A flash supressor, on the
        other hand, was never intended to quiet the gun... any such effect
        is secondary. It's primary purpose is to minimize the amount
        of muzzle flash caused by the escaping gasses. In truth, the
        flash supressor was not originally designed so that it would
        conceal the location of the person firing a weapon so equipped...
        rather it was constructed so that a person firing a weapon at
        night wouldn't be blinded by his own flashes and hence be worthless
        for the remainder of the fight. Just one flash from the muzzle
        of a pistol or rifle is enough to cause the iris of the eye to
        contract such that a person simply cannot see anything in darkened
        conditions for several minutes.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">While a flash supressor
        does minimize the amount of flash visible, it only does so from
        the sides and rear. Anyone in front of the weapon can still see
        into the hole on the end of the supressor and see the incandescent
        gasses during firing of the weapon. But, rather than a large
        globe of lit-up terrain, there is just a blinking dot on the
        end of the supressor to indicate the location of the firing person.
        I think it would be interesting to implement this in code, such
        that someone firing with a supressor or silencer would still
        show a dot of flash if being faced head on.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Finally, the size of a
        silencer or a flash supressor must be rather larger than shown
        on popular television. The supressors designed for combat rifles
        by the military are upwards of twenty-four inches in length and
        add up to ten pounds of weight to the muzzle of the gun. They
        are bulky and awkward... and for a silencer, it is only good
        for a few shots, then the internals becomed gummed up with the
        powder residue and it begins getting louder and louder, although
        still not nearly as loud as a weapon without a silencer.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Do I want to change ActionQuake
        to reflect any of these real-world facts? Probably not... we're
        looking to have fun, not to train for the next FBI field day.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">It's strange... even though
        I'm well aware of the accuracy rules, I rarely find myself crouching
        down in order to squeeze off a few better shots. This might be
        partially due to the fact that everyone seems to be running around
        at breakneck speed, and squatting down doesn't help you much
        when you're whipping your mouse around wildly in order to try
        to get a bead on someone.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Of course, it might be
        a bit different if you had a gang war... say a level set up with
        two distinct sides, and the special items and weapons scattered
        out in the no-man's-land in the middle. Who knows, perhaps then
        you could have small fireteams moving around, squatting behind
        cover and covering each other's backs.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">The problem is, it seems
        that most people tend to shoot towards the middle of the body,
        and when you squat down your head is right on the most common
        plane of bullet trajectory. I swear, every time I duck down to
        be all sneaky and tactical, I get headshot.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">It would be awfully nice
        if the mod were programmed to let you go completely prone and
        crawl. Although I can just see myself crawling around being all
        stealthy and having some fool run up and shoot me in the back
        while standing over me. Then there's the problem that your bullets
        tend to come from the bottom of the screen, which means that
        you can peek over a nice little obstacle, line up and squeeze
        the trigger, and shoot the crate just inches in front of you.
        Very annoying. There's got to be a way that could be fixed...
        sheesh, if I can see someone unobstructed over an edge, I should
        be able to shoot them without any problem.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">It should be a good tactic
        to duck down behind cover in order to minimize the body area
        exposed while still being able to return fire. Instead it seems
        that your screen view comes from the center of your chest. If
        you examine how you hold a firearm in relation to your eyes,
        the gun is on the same level and perhaps a bit to the right (or
        left, depending upon your handedness), especially if you are
        looking through a scope.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Now, I understand that
        we could possibly just be shooting from the hip with all these
        weapons, but that's kind of silly. I can see shooting from the
        hip with the MP5, but not with a pistol, and especially not with
        the Steyr sniper rifle! Additionally, where you hold your weapon
        would change considerably when you are crouching.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Perhaps I can persuade
        enough people that the code can be changed a little... (if possible),
        because I feel that there are some tactics that would come into
        play a lot more if the game engine would allow for it better.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">And maybe, just maybe....
        if you crouch down stationary with a flat surface directly in
        front of you, perhaps we could be 50% more accurate for being
        able to rest our weapon in a bench rest fashion?</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">In our continuing lecture
        on real world physics, our trivia-ridden host will toss out some
        information on minor incindiary and fragmentary charges.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">I love explosives... and
        I especially love getting the odd frag with one. Even better,
        occasionally you can manage to get two or three people with just
        one grenade, which will leave you smiling for a good half hour.
        However, there are a few points to ponder with ActionQuake's
        grenade modelling... and I intend to bring them up for discussion.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Note: this next bit was
        fixed in V.95</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc" FACE="Arial">Firstly, although most
        handgrenades contain a chemical fuze that &quot;burns&quot; in
        some fashion or other in order to have a foolproof timer for
        the explosive charge, I seriously doubt if many of the grenades
        produced world wide actually smoke while the fuze activates.
        Hence, I don't understand why, other than the obvious reason
        that it's kind of cool and is easier to spot, they decided to
        make grenades smoke when you throw them in ActionQuake.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc" FACE="Arial">I personally feel that
        it would be far more reasonable to have no smoke, such that people
        would have to listen for the sound of the grenade hitting the
        ground and be careful to spot it's small shape when it's thrown.
        All too often the people I'm trying to frag get away clean because
        they easily see the trail of smoke, know where the grenade landed,
        and are able to run out of the blast area in time.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Other than that the grenade
        seems pretty decent. But, for your personal edification, I'll
        explain a bit more about how the grenade does it's dirty work.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">When a grenade explodes
        it's internal packing of a TNT-derivative material shatters it's
        specially designed metal casing into thousands of tiny pieces
        of shrapnel. The shrapnel alone can kill for as far as it can
        travel (reasonably), which means that you could be killed by
        a fragment a city block away. Of course, the closer you are to
        the epicenter of the explosion, the denser the flying fragments
        are, and thus the more assured you will be to be dead. Of course,
        if you are hiding behind a steel plate just five feet away from
        the explosion, you could be untouched by shrapnel, provided that
        the fragments didn't penetrate the plate.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">However, any explosion
        of size will cause a air pressure shockwave that can kill as
        quickly as a bullet. The expanding gasses of the vaporized core
        of the grenade compress the air around in a sphere that expands
        outward very rapidly. A shock wave will not propogate nearly
        as far as the fragments will fly, but, of course, the damage
        and kill zone for the shock wave will be dependant upon the size
        of the explosive charge and the force with which it explodes.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">This means that a person
        hiding behind a metal plate just five feet away from a grenade
        may still be killed by the air pressure wave that flows outwards
        and around the plate. The compression of the air molecules can
        reach the density of steel, which means that being close enough
        to an explosion can be like getting hit by a steel wall travelling
        at or faster than the speed of sound. It's enough to pop the
        eyes out of your head and cause bleeding from soft tissue areas
        at the very least.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Once again, this is all
        very interesting, but should it be in ActionQuake? Well, perhaps
        it should... I do think it would be quite neat to have a semi-transparent
        shockwave that expanded out from the grenade for ten or twenty
        feet. The shockwave would do damage regardless of cover, while
        fragmentation damage could be nullified by cover.</FONT></P>

        as the &quot;bulletproof&quot; vest. While anyone and everyone
        knows that police officers wear them, and have their lives saved
        by them, most people assume that wearing one will make you practically
        invincible. Well, let's just start out by saying that a bullet
        travelling at 900 to 1200 feet per second isn't just going to
        bounce off without leaving a mark.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Kevlar is a very tough,
        durable woven material that can absorb massive amounts of energy
        before tearing. However, anyone who has examined the topic of
        armor at all will tell you that it all depends upon what hits
        the target, how hard it hits the target, and at what angle it
        hits the target.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Kevlar vests are made of
        dozens of layers of kevlar weave. A small bullet striking such
        a vest at an angle would likely deflect, causing deformation
        of the material, but not penetrating much. A small bullet striking
        straight-on would more likely tear through several layers and
        deform the vest seriously before expending it's energy.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Composition of the projectile
        also makes a difference. Soft lead projectiles deform quickly
        and expend much energy as heat in the deformation process, which
        is good if hitting flesh since the deforming and mushrooming
        bullet will cause more damage and impart more knockdown force
        to the target. A completely jacketed bullet has a copper casing
        that gives extra strength to the skin of the bullet. This causes
        the bullet to deform less initially, allowing it to penetrate
        farther before it breaks up. Such a jacketed bullet would penetrate
        farther through the kevlar layer, perhaps even passing completely
        through them, although the bullet would be greatly slowed. Note
        that fully jacketed bullets aren't good against unarmored targets,
        for unless the bullet strikes the skeletal structure it will
        pass through flesh making a small, neat hole and not deform at
        all.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Hollow point jacketed bullets
        are a hybrid of different purpose. They are designed for stopping
        the unarmored target, for the hollow point design splits down
        the center radially upon impact and deforms massively. Such a
        bullet would penetrate a kevlar vest even less than a solid lead
        slug.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Additional forms of jacketing
        or slug material have been used, including extremely heavy and
        dense depleted uranium slugs, which slice through most armors
        like it were nothing.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">But back to the vest itself.
        When a projectile strikes the vest the energy of the bullet is
        transferred to the vest in the form of a little heat and a lot
        of kinetic force. This force travels through the vest and is
        transferred to the wearer, although the vest itself absorbs a
        little of the energy. The important part is that the surface
        area of the nose of the bullet, probably just a couple tenths
        of a square inch, transfers it's energy to the vest and is spread
        over several tens of square inches, meaning that the body underneath
        can absorb the energy without the tissue being sliced straight
        through as a bullet would without the kevlar vest.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">However...</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Even the force of a small
        bullet, say from a .22 rifle, is enough to bruise a large area
        and perhaps knock the person down if they aren't braced for the
        impact. Being struck by a 230 grain bullet travelling at speeds
        of 900 to 1200 feet per second, such as from the weapons used
        in ActionQuake, is enough to cause massive bruising, momentary
        loss of orientation, and possibly even rupturing internal organs
        and breaking bones.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">A bullet travelling at
        twice the speed of sound, such as the bullet from the Sig Sauer
        SSG 3000 is enough to penetate straight through the kevlar material.
        A glancing shot would at least knock a person down and cause
        severe bruising and perhaps breaking a few assorted local parts
        of the skeleton.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">What does this mean for
        ActionQuake? Not much for now... but I put the information here
        for people to read and think about. Perhaps in the future something
        will be done with this knowledge, but for now we can stick with
        the mod the way it is... because it's just too damn fun.</FONT></P>

      </TR>
      <TR>
        <TD WIDTH="654" BGCOLOR="#009999"><BASEFONT SIZE=2>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">The M4 combat carbine is
        part of the M16 family of combat rifles designed for the US military.
        Originally prototyped as the AR-15 by Armalite in 1963, this
        weapon was adopted by the military for widespread use despite
        it's many shortcomings, which I will detail a few of in this
        short essay. To be honest, the M16 family is not among the best
        of military weapons, although they have proven reasonably capable
        in their years of service.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">To begin with, military
        specification weapons are not typically as accurate as civilian
        weapons. This is not true, of course, of specialty weapons, such
        as the bolt action rifles that the marines use for sniping. However,
        for mass production weapons such as the M4, the tolerances within
        the receiver of the weapon are greater than that of a civilian
        grade rifle. The reasons for this are because of the circumstances
        of war... the military wants a weapon that does not jam or fail
        to cycle when using dented, dirty, or corroded ammunition. So
        the action of a weapon must be slightly larger to allow for damage
        and defects within the ammunition it uses.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">The receiver of the M4
        has a recessed bolt face, which allows the ejector claws to seat
        the cartridge more squarely into the center of the chamber of
        the barrel, which means that despite the higher tolerances within
        the action, the rifle still maintains a modicum of accuracy.
        However, this is also dependant upon the tolerance of the recess
        within the bolt face itself, which may be a touch oversized too.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">The AR-15 design uses a
        gas tube running back along the barrel to work the action, as
        opposed to the other prototype they designed at the same time,
        called th AR-18. The AR-18 has a piston arrangement, where the
        gas pushed a short cylinder that moved a rod back and forth which
        worked the action of the weapon. The AR-15 design is simpler
        to create, and has less moving parts, but suffered from a drawback
        that wasn't realized during the testing of the weapon.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Military grade ammunition
        uses round powder that has a plastic-like coating. The powder
        has round grains because it will pack evenly into a shell, where
        other types of powder can stack differently depending upon the
        shape of the powder grains. This is mostly a manufacture consideration,
        since round powder was picked since it didn't jam the machines
        that were mass producing the billions of rounds of ammo.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Furthermore, the real effect
        of the problem wasn't realized until large quantities of this
        type of ammunition was fired through M16 rifles in a very humid
        environment. As you may already be able to guess, that humid
        environment was the jungles of Vietnam.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">The problem is that in
        a humid environment the plastic coating of the powder will build
        up over time within the gas tubes of the weapon, especially with
        the vast amounts of ammunition that were fired through these
        weapons in the combat situations seen in Vietnam. Once enough
        plastic built up on the gas tubes, the weapon's action simply
        wouldn't cycle correctly and the weapon would jam... permanently.
        Without a good ten minutes to strip the weapon and run rods through
        the gas tubes to clean them out, the weapon was simply non functional...
        no amount of banging on the weapon would clear this sort of jam.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">A great many men died in
        the jungles of Vietnam because their M16 failed in this fashion.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Another problem with the
        M16 is the bullet size, which is basically a .223 caliber round,
        with the problem being that at optimal bullet speed and rotation
        for accuracy, the bullet would make a clean wound straight through
        the human target without causing the type if knockdown and tissue
        damage that would incapacitate. Basically, the bullet will pass
        right through soft tissue, making a nice clean entry and exit
        wound without expanding or tumbling. This is wholly unsatisfactory,
        of course, because if you manage to hit the enemy, you want them
        to stay down and out of the action.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">So the M16 family is rifled
        with a barrel that has one complete twist every seven inches,
        which is an extremely fast twist. Study of ballistics reveals
        that there is an optimal rotational speed for a projectile, where
        going slower doesn't stabilize a bullet enough, and spinning
        too fast destabilizes a bullet by converting a bullet's internal
        vibration back into pitch and yaw.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Every bullet picks up vibration
        upon being fired, as it initially jumps from the brass to the
        rifling it has pitch and yaw that is converted to vibration as
        it begins to spin down the rifling of the barrel. Additionally,
        the entire barrel itself vibrates like a tuning fork, with thicker
        barrels vibrating less than lighter, thinner barrels. Note that
        the M16 has a very light barrel, but has bands of metal around
        the barrel at the harmonic nodes of the metal, significantly
        reducing the amount of harmonic vibration along the length of
        the barrel. Note that there are variations within the M16 family
        with the HBAR designation, meaning Heavy Barrel Automatic Rifle,
        which are merely versions that have heavier barrels for greater
        accuracy.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Nonetheless, a bullet has
        vibrational internal energy which converts back into pitch and
        yaw as the bullet exits the muzzle of the barrel. This pitch
        and yaw can be minimized by rotation of the projectile, which
        is the whole purpose of rifling. Note that air flow also causes
        vibration and variation of the bullet path, however the boat-tail
        design of the projectile minimizes the amount of drag and turbulence
        behind the bullet. Optimal rotation of a bullet allows the bullet
        to fly like a perfectly thrown football, rotating around it's
        center of mass without significant wobble.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">However, a bullet that
        is rotated faster than this optimal angular speed will begin
        to pick up wobble again. The military purposefully designed the
        M16 to over rotate the bullet in order to destabilize it, which
        causes the bullet to fly relatively straight, although the bullet
        is wobbling about it's axis as it continues in it's trajectory.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">This means the bullets
        will strike the target on a slightly oblique heading even though
        the bullet is traveling in a straight path. This causes the bullet
        to tumble through the target tissue, causing great damage and
        perhaps even shattering the bullet within the body it hits.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Earlier wars typically
        saw weapons of .30-06 caliber, which is a much more massive slug
        traveling at slower speeds. (Well, at least they were traveling
        at slower speeds in those days.) These large calibers do not
        need engineering gimmicks such as over rotation to provide the
        knockdown and damage potential required. They pack a hell of
        a wallop by their very nature.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">However, the tradeoff is
        a heavier weapon, and heavier ammunition. The military wanted
        to give the soldier a convenient weapon that they could pack
        lots of ammunition for. In general, the M16 family has served
        adequately, although certainly not being the best or most reliable
        weapon that is available.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">On a side note, it was
        pointed out that if the military had used the same rifles from
        World War 2 in Vietnam, they may have been much better off, for
        the sheer size and weight of the weapon was such that the small
        stature of the Vietnamese couldn't have easily held or carried
        such a weapon. (I have to agree that the M1 and M2 are quite
        barrel heavy and you need a bit of upper body strength to aim
        them.)</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Actually, a better choice
        for reliability and power is the FN-FAL, but since the M4 is
        already in AQ2, I guess we're stuck with it. And so, we conclude
        another brief foray in the wide world of weapons history. I hope
        you're taking notes!</FONT></P>

        <TD WIDTH="654" BGCOLOR="#009999"><BASEFONT SIZE=2>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Here is an excerpt from
        an email I received...</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">As a former Personal Weapons
        Instructor and Range Officer in the Canadian Armed Forces, I
        appreciate the work you have done on your site to educate and
        dispel some of the myths associated with &quot;real&quot; weapons.
        I find Action Quake to be the closest to a real shootout I have
        ever experienced and share your enthusiasm in &quot;improving&quot;
        the experience to be as realistic as possible.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">That being said, I disagree
        with your description of the inaccuracy and poor stopping power
        of the M16 series of rifles versus the older FAL style &quot;battle
        rifles&quot;. In addition, having used both in operational theatres
        and on the range, I would much prefer carrying the lighter and
        more compact M16a2 (C7a1 in Canada) over the FAL any day. Apart
        from weight (of the ammo and of the weapon), the M16 series is
        far superior to any &quot;battle rifle&quot; for the following
        reasons:</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">The 5.56mm NATO (SS109)
        round used by the M16 series is superior for an assault rifle
        type weapon because more rounds can be held in the magazine.
        It also produces less recoil and less flash, making the M16 controllable
        when fired in the automatic mode (3rb or full auto). Also, having
        less recoil, the 5.56 mm round can be fired rapidly in semi automatic
        mode, allowing for quick follow-up shots without disturbing aim
        drastically.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">The performance of the
        bullet is also very similar to performance of a 7.62mm round
        at typical engagement ranges (under 400 metres). Both will penetrate
        body armour (helmets and vests) at this range and both are capable
        of penetrating upwards of 10mm of steel armour plate. Contrary
        to your reference about rifling and bullet stability, 5.56mm
        rounds do<BR>
        not tumble in mid flight and this is largely due to the fact
        that in the A2 series of rifles, the rifling has been reduced
        to a 1 in 10 ratio and modifications to the SS109 NATO round
        have given it greater inherent stability. Furthermore, the velocity
        of a 5.56mm round over 400 metres is nearly 30% higher than that
        of a 7.62mmNATO round which means shorter flight times, flatter
        trajectory and greater accuracy.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Wounds produced by 5.56mm
        ammunition are also far more deadly and damaging than those produced
        by 7.62mm ammunition. The major reason for this is that the velocity
        of the bullet, coupled with its inherent instability cause the
        bullet to tumble and fragment upon entering a target. This is
        where 5.56mm bullets tumble, not in the air. Wounds produced
        by 7.62mm ammunition are comparatively smaller and less damaging
        as the bigger, slower, more stable bullet typically drills a
        hole through its target without &quot;exploding&quot; as 5.56mm
        ammo tends to do.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">But 7.62mm ammunition continues
        to be used for specific applications and there are good reasons
        for this, mostly in sniper and machinegun roles. The 7.62mm bullet,
        at ranges over 400 metres is more accurate, less likely to tumble
        or be redirected by crosswinds and retains more of its energy
        at longer ranges.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">A note about the M4 (C8a1
        in Canada). As a tank crew member, we carried these little nasties
        exclusively. They are almost identical except in size and weight
        and have a higher rate of full auto fire (800 rounds per minute
        versus 700 for the rifle version). By the way, Canadian rifles
        are not fixed to fire 3 round bursts like the American versions.
        On the range, we were always able to match the Infantry (with
        their full size M16s) round-for-round in accuracy and timed shooting.
        On the Close<BR>
        Assault ranges (where you engage targets at under 40 metres in
        rapid succession while moving) we usually beat them--it really
        pissed them off. The compact size and handiness of this weapon
        can't be beat and as long as you fire short bursts, you'll shred
        anything you aim at.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">The saying goes, &quot;If
        you know you're going to a gun fight, leave your pistol at home
        and bring a shotgun, submachinegun or assault rifle.&quot; Make
        mine a C8a1.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Here is my response...</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">I will post portions of
        your message as a counter-point to my own statements. Please
        note that most of these observations are regarding the original
        issue M16 as it saw combat in Vietnam. There have been marked
        improvements in the weapon since that time.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">I will agree that the additional
        ammo load is a great boon, and, of course, was the reason the
        5.56 caliber was adopted in the first place. Additionally, the
        M16 family are very light and compact weapons as compared to
        the larger battle rifles... which does weigh favorably with the
        men that have to tote them around the battlefield.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">I'm going to have to re-read
        what I wrote up, because I don't think I said the bullet tumbled...
        but more it wobbled about it's axis of rotation. This wobble
        is very minute, and is present in every bullet that travels out
        the end of any barrel. Velocity, angular rotation, drag, and
        mass all factor in to how a bullet tavels through the atmosphere,
        and although these factors can be balanced and optimized, they
        can never truly cancel out the wobble of the projectile. The
        problem is that the barrel itself vibrates with the sudden release
        of energy... a vibration which will be transferred to the bullet
        no matter what. This being said, I'll have to stipulate that
        a fractional variation in the wobble of a bullet will have exponential
        effect on the target mass. To be more precise, the greater the
        angle of incidence from a line parallel to the path of bullet
        travel, the greater the &quot;randomness&quot; (or deviation)
        of the bullet tumble and path through the target body. This assumes
        a homogenous medium, which, of course, the human body is not...
        so even greater deviation of path within the body occurs due
        to the changes in density within the tissues and bones.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">At any rate, the pros and
        cons of each weapon are biased by the fact that some people prefer
        the more compact carbines and rifles, and some prefer the larger
        rifles... and no amount of statistical analysis will change their
        opinions about the weapons they love. I will state that in general
        there are no military weapons that I prefer over all others...
        but I am more partial to the older battle rifles if pressed on
        the matter.</FONT></P>
