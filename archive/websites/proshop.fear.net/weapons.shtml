        MP5 is a very sweet little combat weapon designed to deliver
        extremely large quantities of lead in minimal time. The MP5 has
        a 30 round capacity clip of 10mm 245 grain rounds which it can
        fire off completely in about four seconds, propelling each bullet
        at around 1300 feet per second. Like all automatic weapons, it
        is not very accurate, especially at range... however, in close
        proximity it is unparalleled. The MP5 accepts both the silencer

        M3 Super 90 is the weapon of choice for both professionals and
        law enforcement officers of all types. This weapon clears a hallway
        nicely with a 3 inch, 12 gauge shell packing a twelve pellets
        of 00-buckshot that have a muzzle velocity of about 1100 feet
        per second. What each of these pellets lacks in penetration they
        make up for by spreading over a nice area, causing multiple wounds
        simultaneously. Additionally, accuracy is not nearly as important,
        although the spread of the shot pattern at distance makes this
        a short to medium range weapon. The M3 has an under-barrel magazine
        that holds 7 shells which must be reloaded one at a time.</FONT></P>

        shells can be loaded with #4 buckshot, which contains a few dozen
        pellets of smaller size than 00 buckshot. While each pellet does
        less damage, the overall effect of #4 buckshot on an unarmored
        target is much more devastating. This is just sort of extraneous
        information since there is only one generic type of shotgun shell

        Sniper Rifle is the marksman's weapon of choice. This bolt action
        is the epitome of accuracy at extreme range, delivering a .308
        caliber projectile at over 3000 feet per second. The high precision
        of this rifle is accomplished through use of a barrel in excess
        of 24 inches coupled with a bolt style action which deforms much
        less than other actions under the stress of such a high-velocity
        charge. The rifle has a five round magazine, but must be manually
        operated with the bolt after each shot, leading to a slower fire
        rate.</FONT></P>

        of fire and a protected location, this is the weapon to use.
        Note that it may be equipped with the silencer, although this
        streches reality quite considerably. Since the bullet travels
        in excess of two times the speed of sound it is impossible to
        silence, however flash supression is still a good idea. The best
        defense for the sniper is the distance he can put between himself

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">The M26 Fragmentation Grenade
        is usually reserved for the armed forces, however, some resourceful
        individuals obtain them for their own use. These little pineapples
        explode in a fearful storm of flying shrapnel in addition to
        a concussion wave that can kill through sheer air pressure.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">The grenade has a three
        second fuze that activates as soon as the spoon separates from
        the body of the grenade. As the grenade can throw shrapnel father
        than it can be reasonably tossed, it is a good idea to gain cover
        after throwing the device.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">It took me a couple tries
        to figure out how to use the grenade... it seems you need to
        hold down the fire button for about a second until you hear the
        little <I>*ping*</I> of the pin coming out of the grenade. From
        that point on whenever you release the fire button you will throw
        the pineapple.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Shown above is the british
        L2A1, which is very similar in design to the M26. (Still looking
        for a good image of this device.)</FONT></P>

        the weapon of choice for the professional that wants to inflict
        maximum damage without caring how much noise or mess he creates.
        The noisy chatter of this weapon is both a repellant and an attractor:
        everyone runs like hell if they are in the line of fire, and
        everyone swarms to the spot to nab the weapon from the owner
        if they can.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">The M4 is much more accurate,
        and much more damaging than the MP5. You can run and still hold
        a decent group of shots with this bad boy. Additionally, the
        penetrating bullets rip through as many bodies as care to get
        in the way... so if you know where a crowded room is, grab this
        weapon and cry havoc!</FONT></P>
