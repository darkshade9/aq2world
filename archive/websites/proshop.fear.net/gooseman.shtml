            the awesome multiplayer P.C. for quake2 that adds a new twist
            to Quake2. Featuring weapons taken from real life, and other
            nifty changes, this makes one of the very best patches ever to
            be release for Quake2. Anyway, let's get on with the interview,
            should we? (By the way, that's Mr. Clark, under the name "timm", interviewing..) <BR>

            My real name is Minh Le. I'm 21 years old and I live in Surrey,
            Canada (it's very close to Vancouver, Canada). Currently, I'm
            a 3rd year computing science student at Simon Fraser University.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">How did you get
            into modeling?</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
            I first started it a year ago. I played with a few mods for Quake1
            (Railgun comes to mind..) and I thought it would be possible
            to do real life guns in Quake. I always had a thing for military
            style weapons and I read a lot of books on the subject. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">What program do
            you use?</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
            Originally, I used Quark Army Knife to create the meshes and
            QME to animate the mesh (as well as skin the models) but the
            newer models (the ones I did for Action Quake) were done using
            only QME 3.1. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">Why qME? </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
            Cause it was very easy to learn and it was dirt cheap. I'm a
            student and I have lots of other interests, I needed something
            that wouldn't take up all my time and learning QME was just the
            thing. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">Why don't you tell
            us how you got into the Quake Scene.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
            </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
            Back when Quake1 was hip, there was a site called the QuakeC
            archives, they'd review mods and I played a couple of the mods
            on the QuakeC archives and it got me really interested in making
            mods. Originally, I was a pure deathmatcher. Deathmatching is
            fun but way too addictive for me. I sometimes find it hard to
            pull myself away from a DM game... <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">Why the army\navy
            theme? </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
            I'm a big military buff. I always wanted to join but it was never
            in the cards... <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">Why did you decided
            to leave the Navy Seals 2 team and begin modeling for AQ2 instead?</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
            I wasn't jiving with the team. I wanted to be more involved in
            the coding aspect of the MOD but people weren't liking that so,
            I had to concentrate on modelling.. I don't like it when I have
            no say in coding. To me, it's very important that I code the
            models into Quake2 because it lets me bring it to life the way
            I wanted it to be. I hate spending weeks modelling something
            and letting someone else code it.. it bugs me since I can code
            it within hours. I don't hold any grudges against the Navy SEALS
            team and I just wanted to say my thanks to them for treating
            me good after I left the team. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">When did you decide
            to start working on Action Quake2? </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
            I didn't really decide to be a part of the team initially. When
            I first played Action Quake I liked it and it was the MOD most
            closest to the current MOD I was working on (a single player
            MOD called Rolling Thunder that never really panned out...).
            I contacted Cail and asked him if he would like to have my models.
            At the time, I was very busy with social life and full time work
            so I thought I'd just let someone have my models and put them
            to good use since I never had the time to fully complete my MOD.
            I gave Cail all my models at the time (Colt M4A1, Mk-23, MP-5N,
            Benelli Super 90, Sig Sauer SSG 3000) and the code for them (which
            involved reloading and ejecting shells). The only models I made
            exclusively for Action Quake were the Akimbo Pistols and the
            new plug in player model. Everything else was done before joining
            the A-team. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">What was your goal
            back then? </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
            To see my models in action (no pun intended). I liked Action
            Quake at the time.. it was fun the first time I played it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">What is your goal
            now? </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
            I'm heading back to school in a couple of weeks, things could
            very well come to a complete halt for me in the modelling department.
            I did the same thing for Navy SEALS a year ago... oh well, I
            have about a year left of school, after that's done, then real
            life begins and who knows, I may never get a chance to model
            again.. My short term goal with regards to Action Quake is to
            finish the VWEP support (handcannon, akimbo pistols and grenades
            need to be done). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">How do you all work
            so well together? </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
            I don't know .. I work by myself, I just send Cail the finished
            models. I was surprised when I saw v.95 because a lot of the
            features in v.95 I wasn't aware of. It's great though, very cool.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">With 0.95 soon out
            the door, what do you guys have planned for 0.96? </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
            VWEP support, acceleration changes (maybe), some other stuff
            I think. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">Any chance we'll
            see the viewable weapons in there? </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
            uhhhh.. yeah. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">What new models
            can we expect to see from you? </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
            hmmm, well, I'm learning 3d Studio MAX right now and figured
            out how to use Mesh deformation.. so now I got this hand model
            that's MUCH BETTER than the previous one because the hand is
            one mesh and it animates much &quot;smoother&quot;. I'm working
            on a new mk-23 pistol model :-) I can't say that I'll finish
            it before school starts but I just want to see how it will look
            like with mesh deformation, should be way better than the current
            mk-23. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">Will you guys be
            doing something like this with Half Life or Sin?(or any upcoming
            FPS for that matter)</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
            I like the Sin engine, it has nice muzzle flashes (something
            I wanted the Quake2 engine to have so badly) but Sin is still
            restricted by that stupid 10 hz client side update, I don't want
            to go into detail why that's such a bad thing but it's a bad
            thing...if you're trying to implement a realistic firearm. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">What do you think
            is the single most coolest thing in AQ as of right now? </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
            there isn't ONE thing that really sticks out, I mean it's the
            whole shebang that makes it cool. Sometimes, it makes me wonder
            why we got so lucky with Action themes.. I mean if you take a
            look at some other Quake2 mods out there, they have TONS of features
            (more than ours even) yet they still aren't as popular as Action
            Quake.. I think we hit a common theme that appeals to more gamers
            out there when we decided to go for the Action theme. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">If you could do
            ANYTHING with AQ, what would that be? </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
            hmm.. tough one. I personally would like to see better visual
            f/x when it comes to firing the guns in Action Quake. I just
            think it's lame that we don't see any muzzle flashes and smoke
            puffs that in real life would TOTALLY DOMINATE your view. I once
            saw the local police officers fire off an mp-5 in a closed room..
            damn loud and VERY smoky. In an open area though mp-5's are quit
            silent. Looking at Blood2 makes me wanna get my hands on that
            engine.. smoke puffs everywhere, muzzle flashes, shells flying
            all over the place! wow. As real as it gets baby! <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">Anything else you'd
            like to add before we end this interview? </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
            I'd like to thank the A-team for letting me be a part of this
            great success that is Action Quake and I'd also like to thank
            a special pal named Intro. I first met him when I started Navy
            SEALS and without him I wouldn't be doing this stuff... he was
            at the time my number one fan and gave me a lot of words of encouragement
            that allowed me to get to the stage I am right now. If it weren't
            for him , I'd have quit this modelling stuff a long time ago.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">Thanks dude!</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
            Thanks timm! It's nice to be recognized for the work I've done
            for the Quake2 community. And it's especially nice to be interviewed
            only twice in my life and it was always with the same person
            ;-) <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#f5edad" FACE="Arial">So, that's it folks!
            Hopefully you all know a little bit more about this member of
