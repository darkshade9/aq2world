        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Welcome to the tactics
        section, which will hopefully help out some of you that feel
        like everyone else some kind of superhuman ActionQuake cyborg
        with controls directly wired into their brain. To put it simply,
        some people just can't figure out what makes the good players,
        well, <I>good</I>.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">To begin with, we'll cover
        controller setup, computer and video setup, internet connections,
        and then move on to some common sense tips for anyone and everyone.</FONT></P>

        <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Controller Setup</FONT></B></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">I've played them all, and
        I've used all of the standard control methods. Now, while keyboard
        only was sufficient for Doom, what with elevation not mattering...
        just lateral aim, the situation has changed with the advent of
        real 3D games. Now you must be able to look up and down at a
        moments notice, and be able to do so without taking your finger
        off the trigger or moving your hands in such a way that you can't
        move quickly if you spot trouble.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">So the keyboard is out...
        at least using <I>only</I> the keyboard. Now there is the possibility
        of using a joystick, but there are just too many controls, which
        makes using just a joystick also a losing proposition. You can
        combine the joystick with the keyboard, which is exactly what
        I did a while ago, when I was seriously playing Descent 2 all
        the time... but that turned out to not work so well. By nature
        of the Quake engine, being able to whirl around rapidly is a
        must, and with any joystick you simply can't control your aim
        well enough to be able to accomplish such maneuvers and still
        be able to aim well.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">The preferred control setup
        is, of course, the mouse and keyboard together. Using &quot;freelook&quot;
        to aim and turn, and using a &quot;T&quot; or &quot;+&quot; shaped
        group of keys to control forward and backward movement and side
        to side strafing movement. I found out that just as in Descent,
        being able to strafe or slide sideways during combat is of paramount
        importance.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">So set up your two mouse
        buttons to be &quot;fire&quot; and one other common command (usually
        &quot;jump&quot;) and then set up your keyboard for the other
        hand so that all the keys are in a convenient spot. Once you
        play for a few days the keys will become second nature under
        your fingers, so don't worry about making keys mnemonics so that
        &quot;b&quot; is bandage and &quot;o&quot; is opendoor. I almost
        never look down at the keyboard while I'm playing, and neither
        should you... because if you aren't watching the screen, then
        you're going to be a sitting target for whoever comes along.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">On a side note, esteemed
        AQ2 activist &quot;BattleAxe&quot; noted that he plays with yet
        another combination of controls. It seems he uses a mouse in
        the right hand to aim and fire and crouch, and then uses a joystick
        in his left hand to move and perform a couple other actions.
        This is quite an innovative setup, for sure!</FONT></P>

        <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Computer and Video Setup</FONT></B></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">First off, you'd better
        damn well be playing on a computer with a processor that is equal
        or better to a Intel Pentium 200. Anything slower will get so
        bogged down that your frame rate will go blotto and you'll have
        a very hard time aiming at anyone who is a running target. I
        remember playing Descent 2 on a 5x86 120, and it was fine right
        up until a serious dogfight broke out... then the inferior FPU
        would cut my frame rate down so low that I'd have problems maneuvering
        and aiming. Never underestimate the value of a good, fast computer
        to help out your abilities.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Furthermore, it is almost
        a necessity to get a good 3D accelerator board. I run my Viper330
        at 640x480 opengl, which is pretty playable on the PPro-200.
        The more advanced video card you can get, the better... because
        a smoother frame rate on your monitor means it's easier to aim.
        I've played with friends who didn't have 3D cards, and they said
        I would keep killing them before they could even determine if
        I was in their field of view or not, especially at long ranges.
        If you plan to be a sniper, then you'd better make sure you have
        a decent video board.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">The combination of a fast
        processor and a fast video processor will greatly enchance your
        ActionQuake experience. But sometimes there are other factors
        that keep the game from being as playable as it should be.</FONT></P>

        <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Internet Connections</FONT></B></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Nothing will make you as
        frustrated as a laggy net connection that freezes, lags, and
        chops your game into unplayable pieces. The absolute minimum
        I would recommend is a 33.6 kbaud modem, with 56k being about
        the best for normal dial-up. Some lucky fools have ISDN or Cable
        Modems, while some even luckier fools are directly wired to the
        net with 10baseT or 100baseTX.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Common symptoms of a laggy
        connection are smooth movement, with opponents that seem to jump
        from one spot to the other, and your shots coming off a half
        second or more after you press the button. Playing with a half
        second of lag or more gets very annoying quickly. Furthermore,
        I've had my modem decide to re-train the connection in the middle
        of a fight, which basically clamps off the data for a few seconds....
        during which time your game freezes, then suddenly blazes on
        as the game catches up on the few seconds worth of data that
        comes in all at once.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">If you use gamespy, try
        to connect to the servers with the lowest ping possible. There
        are times when the router network of the internet itself may
        become lagged, as well as times when local ISPs become flooded
        with traffic. In these sorts of situations there isn't much you
        can do but wait for the net to even out and then get back to
        playing.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Note that a high bandwidth
        connection does not necessarily equate to an ultra fast ping
        time, for there is more than sheer bandwidth that comes into
        play. Generally speaking, the closer physically you are to the
        server, the better your network latency will be. This is because
        there's one hell of a lot of internet traffic out there, and
        your AQ2 packets are fighting with all those nasty RealAudio
        streams and CUSEEME dorks for the router's attentions. So if
        you're in New York, don't go looking for servers in Los Angeles
        because you're going to get frustrated as hell with all the network
        lags.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">In general, a fast network
        connection is just as important as a properly equipped computer...
        without either of these you will be at a disadvantage when playing.
        Note, however, that you shouldn't use this as an excuse... nor
        should you claim someone is a &quot;cheatin' tard&quot; because
        they have a much better connection to the net. Just play as best
        you can under the circumstances.</FONT></P>

        <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">A few simple rules that
        can save your ass (sometimes)</FONT></B></P>

        <OL>
          <LI><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Don't stand still in open,
          well-lit areas. This invites everyone to snipe at you to their
          hearts content.</FONT>
          <LI><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Don't stand still in the
          middle of a gun fight. Unless you are doing this as a tactic
          for some reason... such as the situation when you are crouching
          and con't move real fast anyhow. In general, standing still in
          a gunfight is just a quick way to get fragged.</FONT>
          <LI><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Don't try to be a sniper
          from obvious positions or exposed areas. See the rules above
          about standing still.</FONT>
          <LI><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Turn &quot;always run&quot;
          on. Who wants to walk?</FONT>
          <LI><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">When running down long
          halls, slide side to side as you run... maybe even jump from
          time to time if you like. Nothing is as inviting as a broad back
          moving straight away from you, just begging for a bullet.</FONT>
          <LI><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Judge your height. Two
          big crates stacked up on each other is about as much as you can
          fall without taking damage. Try not to lose those hard earned
          kills by falling to your death.</FONT>
          <LI><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Listen for the enemy.
          Use your speakers to locate fire fights and enemies... year ears
          are just as important as your eyes. (My apologies to deaf gamers
          out there.)</FONT>
          <LI><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Wear headphones for the
          best stereo image, meaning you can hear directionally better.
          Use speakers with a subwoofer if you want to really get into
          the big, bassy booms in the game.</FONT>
          <LI><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Don't be predictable.
          If someone nails you twice in the same spot, don't run right
          back to that same spot one more time... unless you've gotten
          a bigger, badder weapon.</FONT>
          <LI><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Let your anger drive your
          senses, but don't let it blind you. I get angry when I get pegged
          over and over, but only to the point that I resolve to try changing
          tactics and trying to track down the guy who keeps tagging me.
          But, I don't so mad that it isn't fun to play anymore. This is
          a game, people.</FONT>
          <LI><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">If you're going to be
          a lurker, try not to move very much, and pick a location with
          a wall behind you. Laying in wait for the passerby is as valid
          a strategy as any... but if you move around a lot in a darkened
          corner your motion will be visible and give you away. Likewise,
          you want to keep your back to a wall, because nothing sucks as
          much as lurking for minutes only to have someone walk up behind
          you and fill your ass with lead. Very humiliating.</FONT>
          <LI><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Occasionally turn around
          and check behind you. Some weapons require being close, and a
          favorite way to get close is to chase someone down. If you check
          your six occasionally, you will lessen the chance of anyone getting
          the drop on you.</FONT>
          <LI><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Bandage yourself. As soon
          as a fire fight ends, start bandaging and go looking for some
          more ammo.</FONT>
          <LI><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Get more ammo... well,
          of course. Always nab as much ammo as possible, because trying
          to jump kick someone is quite difficult, and the unarmed combatant
          is an easy target. (We'll see if the knife changes these rules.)</FONT>
        </OL>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">That's it for basic tips
        and tactics. You'll become accustomed to ActionQuake in time,
        and settle on a playing style that works for you. But always
        remember that you're supposed to be having fun... so laugh out
        loud when you jump kick that poor jerk out a third story window.

        <TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#009999"><BASEFONT SIZE="2">
        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">This style of playing is
        par for the course with the original Quake2 death match. It combines
        high speed with massive sprays of gunfire to accomplish the goal
        of getting the most frags possible. And, while a valid method
        of playing in any case, it is dangerous for any and all players
        to attempt to be the bulletproof action hero.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">In AQ2 you will sometimes
        be thrown into a level that is quite small and has ten or more
        players. It's at this point that I switch to &quot;aggressive&quot;
        mode, for playing stealthily and defensively is simply not very
        feasible. Take for example the &quot;Death Ship&quot; level (dethshp2.bsp)
        in which you are stuck in very tight corridors and tiny rooms.
        There is almost nowhere to dodge, and with six or more players,
        you will constantly be getting pegged in the back while trying
        to chase down someone else.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">I will grant that there
        are some semi-protected spots on these levels where you can try
        to defend yourself with moderate hard cover or the veil of a
        shadowy corner, but unless you have very quick reflexes and very,
        very good internet latency, you will be popped just about as
        often as if you were charging around at a dead run.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Ever try to be sneaky and
        stealthy while down in the main compound of basev28? You'll get
        tagged before you can say &quot;D'oh!&quot; It always seems to
        be a frenetic melee down on the floor of the compound, so if
        you find yourself in the middle of a firefight there, you'd best
        either be aggressive as possible, or run like hell... because
        there is a time and a place to be a sneak-dog, and the middle
        of a firefight isn't one of those places.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Personally, I feel that
        running people aren't inaccurate enough. All too often I get
        pegged by someone charging at me blazing away with a pistol,
        and I'm standing still trying to nail them with an aimed shot.
        It's not that I mind losing to someone... it's that I mind losing
        to them in those conditions, where I'm trying to use skill and
        they are counting on luck. Of course, lady luck is a fickle girl...
        and she isn't always there when you need her.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Basically, I find that
        less populous games, say four or five people at most, are very
        defensive games, with sneakiness and planning being of great
        importance. But as soon as you get eight or nine people or more,
        planning usually goes out the window because of the fact that
        you simply can't watch your back with that many people all gunning
        for each other. Perhaps the teamplay rules will bring some skill
        and planning into the bigger gunfights.</FONT></P>

        of playing involves stealth, use of cover, and careful planning.

        and I duck inside a door and they begin firing like crazy. Of
        course, they expect me to pop out the door and catch some of
        their lead in the process... but I wait to hear their weapon
        go <I>*click*</I>, and when they're reloading, just standing
        in plain view of course, I step out and tag them.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">It's silly how often people
        waste entire clips on a door or wall, just on the off chance
        that the person they just saw will poke their head out. On the
        other hand, I suppose this is a valid tactic since the agressive
        player <I>would</I> turn around and come charging out with their
        guns blazing.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">The defensive player also
        avoids open areas like the plague. Having to cross an open stretch
        of floor makes every professional itch all over, just wishing
        for some cover close by. The cardinal sin of the defensive player
        is to skyline themselves... which is the act of stading on a
        high roof or ledge and looking down trying to spot someone or
        something. Someone standing in such a location is almost always
        100% visible to anyone and everyone, which immediately draws
        a fierce hailstorm of lead slugs... because the best kills are
        those where the body topples off the building!</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Sniping is a skill practiced
        by the defensive player, as it minimizes the risk to the player.
        Of course, if you snipe in an obvious fashion, you are inviting
        everyone to take pot-shots at you. Once again, the silenced and
        supressed weapon is the best friend of the sniper... well, perhaps
        the second best friend after darkness and shadows. The point
        here is to bag your target without being seen... and especially
        to avoid being seen by other people out of your field of vision
        who will then bushwhack you without mercy.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">This style of playing has
        many flavors, which you can see exhibited by which gun a player
        will prefer. Many prefer the M4 for it's devastating fire rate
        and penetration... however, many will shun it because it attracts
        too much attention and cannot be silenced. Others prefer a shotgun,
        giving them the ability to take out even the armored opponent.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Generally, the defensive
        player must discard some of his tactics when a level becomes
        crowded, for it's hard to duck and dodge when you find yourself
        dodging into a room where there's already a firefight. I've had
        several occasions when I've been chased into a room full of flying
        lead, and side-stepped out a convenient door only to be nailed
        by someone coming out that door. What can I say? It's hard to
        be a ninja in a crowd!</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Another problem I pointed
        out in the &quot;opinions&quot; section applies to the defensive
        player, and that is the problem of trying to fire around or over
        hard cover. You will soon discover that your fire comes from
        the lower right corner of the screen, and tend to hit objects
        that you can see over. This means that it's difficult to hide
        behind walls or crates and use them effectively as cover while
        taking well aimed shots at your opponents. This basically just
        sucks, as it detracts from the whole point of being stealthy,
        cautious, and taking care to plan your position. Too often I
        have found out that I end up shooting a crate while someone has
        fun plinking at my exposed head in absolute safety.</FONT></P>

          the tops of ladders, or sometimes wait in a hidden spot where
          they have a clear view of anyone climbing the ladder... then
          rain down hot lead on anyone attempting to climb said ladder.
          Especially bad if they are on the back side of the ladder hole...
          meaning that someone climbing can't shoot them while climbing,
          because they can't look &quot;past&quot; straight up... they'd
          have to turn around to hit the person, which means they'd fall
          off the ladder. A favorite spot of the Ladder Vulture is the

          no-one in their right mind would do this in real life unless
          they were a japanese kamikaze. Anyhow, as you might guess, this
          tactic is very common for people who are close to dying and who
          also are carrying a grenade. They'll pull the pin and then run
          as close to people as possible, waiting to get shot... and, of
          course, releasing the grenade when they die. A good 75% of the

          directly at their hiding spot intent on, of course, doing a bit
          of hiding themselves. The Lurker tends to kill a lot of people

          do we let the fight settle down... we start shooting at the closest
          back and try to mow down everyone in the melee. The Opportunist
          will occasionally manage to find themselves in this situation

                <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Basev28: aaahh, sniper's 
                  heaven. You can get frags by all of my 7 ways. There are so 
                  many sniper spots here all u have to do is use your imagination. 
                  What makes this such a good map is the false sense of security 
                  that the darkness gives people. You would be surprised how many 
                  people sit still, crouched, on the top of the bunker in the 
                  middle, or sit still on the dark corners next to the ramps or 
                  sit still on the roofs etc etc thinking they're safe. They are 
                  safe from people with shotguns and MP5s, but it is so easy to 
                  spot the outline of a player through 4x scope. Also try to spot 
                  the flashes other lurkers / snipers make.<BR>
                  <BR>
                  But there are bad sniper spots in this map:<BR>
                  Top of the lamps: this place, if you're improperly positioned, 
                  will make you VERY visible, with a huge outline against the 
                  background. Also, this place is very accessible and you can 
                  get shot from so many places.<BR>
                  Windows in the two buildings: again the bad camoflage + high 
                  accessibility makes this a no-no. You are outlined by the light 
                  in your back. Players can easily sneak in behind you from the 
                  ladder.<BR>
                  The four guard towers: you can be seen from the catwalks above, 
                  making you susceptible to headshots.<BR>
                  Top of the bunker in the middle: not even a spot, this place 
                  is completely accessible to everybody. You would think it's 
                  safe because you're in the dark and above all the gunfight, 
                  but trust me, don't even think of stopping here.<BR>
                  <BR>
                  Good spots (just one example, i don't want to give out my secrets 
                  now):<BR>
                  At the 4 corners on the perimeter wall. The guard tower will 
                  protect you against people from below and you're completely 
                  invisible while getting a good view of one side and parts of 
                  the roof and bunker.</FONT></P>

                <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">kgb2: This map is designed 
                  with the sniper in mind. Although there are not many darks spots, 
                  the two towers are excellent. It is tough to get to because 
                  of the trapdoor (get ready if you hear footsteps under the tower). 
                  Also there are the four sniper platforms in the main complex 
                  which provides a little variety. In this map the main types 
                  of kills are the gunfight kills. The wide open area will see 
                  many pistol duels where players will stand still.</FONT></P>

                  to choose from and those narrow walkways. Just stay away from

                  my opinion to sniping.</FONT></P>
                <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Sniping seems to 
                  be the art practiced almost exclusively by low-pingers. A high 
                  ping or bad connection is seemingly magnified when attempting 
                  to snipe. But, there are a few tricks that are helpful when 
                  trying to snipe with a high ping, and I hope these help.</FONT></P>

                  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">This is probably 
                    one of the biggest secrets to sniping, and the simplest, but 
                    works extraordinarily well. Let the victim do the work for 
                    you. If a player is heading for a doorway, aim for the doorway. 
                    As soon as his punk head floats into your scope, squeeze the 
                    trigger. You are guaranteed an easy kill. This is especially 
                    easy in high-traffic areas, such at the spiral-room in ActCity2.</FONT></LI>

                    spots carefully. A high perch is not always the best perch. 
                    If you think about it, a ground-level sniping position is 
                    a great idea. If you are much higher then your target, he 
                    can move any number of directions: up, down, left, or right, 
                    whereas he can only move left or right when you are on level 
                    ground. </FONT></LI>
