<b>Review:</b><br>

First off, I just want to give my great great thanks to the author for what he's done with this map... one of the things you may notice right off, is when you jump, you don't jump table-high all the time. This is due to the fact that the gravity is set higher (1200 for you number crunchers, norm is 800), and this complements this mod and level EXTREAMLY well.

<p>

The next point I'd like to hit on is the fact that this map is up on a cliff.... you can't go jumping around and strafing all over the place, or else you will fall off and die. This is something to get used to, but it's really really great. Another point is the new texture work - done extreamly real and awsome. These things could've came from iD themselves. Good job on those, Hanh. The weapon balance in this level is good; even with the M4, all you have to do to get away from it is duck behind one of the handy snow-baracades.These suckers can be used to full advantage for some simply great gun fights, which you don't see alot anymore...

<p>

The only real PROBLEM with this map is the fact that the gravity increase also increased the falling damage...... hmmm..... this can be great fun, really, if you adjust to it.... just don't fall off anything!

<p>

So this is a great map..... as usual, since I'm on a connection that "sucks my ass" (quote by |RaptoR| :-), I don't play over the net, so, no testing was done in that area. I have played it alot lately with my friends ove my LAN here, and it rocks. That's about all... 'till next time.
