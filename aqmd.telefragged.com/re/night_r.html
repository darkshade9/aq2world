<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Layout - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This map is straight forward
and I mean that literally. This is a simulation of a narrow stretch
of land with two well lit areas at each extremity. One base sits
at the bottom of a steep hill, seeming to give that team a major
disadvantage when the round begins. The middle portion of the
map is separated by the effect of tall grass. There are portable
lights set up through out the map, but this gives way to numerous
very dark areas on the entire map.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Textures &amp; Sky - Score
7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The sky is lit with a stars,
giving the feeling of a night setting. The textures are nothing
new on night raid. I feel a bit cheated by the lack of textures
on the tents and lighting units. There could have been more texture
added to improve this map. I also noticed a few seams when hugging
the edges of the map in places. Very minor, but seams nonetheless.
Due to the darkness, this is a minor detail.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Prefabs - Score 7</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The lighting units are unique
and a great idea, but lack detail. This also goes for the tents
at top base. Also scattered throughout the map are the Quake boxes,
which can be use for adequate cover.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sounds - Score 9</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Finally a map with excellent
use of sounds. There are the chirping of crickets, but not on
every portion of the map. As you make your way into the dark,
unlit areas the sound of the crickets fade. Very nicely done.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lighting - Score 9</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Shadows, shadows, shadows! This
maps is full of them from the ample light units on the map. But
there is also a lack of lighting, making for very dark areas.
Areas so dark, you could be next to someone and not even know
it. That is until you have a muzzle flash and you are lying sideways
on the ground. The lighting effect coupled with the sound really
make the map work.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Playability - Score</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The files are named correctly
and unzip into their specific folders. As for r_speeds, I thought
they were a bit on the high side. Thought end map, speeds play
at 400-700. While standing in and around each base, located at
the ends of the map, speeds drop into the 100-300 range. There
are also numerous spots in the middle of the map that can reach
900-1100. Overall, the r_speeds are good.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Teamplay - Score 6</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This map was a great teamplay
map. Very tight quarters, not a sniper map, better make use of
a shotgun or automatic weapon with a silencer to hid the muzzle
flash. It became obvious that each team made their way to the
edges of the map, where there was no light for cover. There was
continuous muzzle flashes from these areas. It became a good tactic
to crouch in the high grass, near the darkened edges to make for
effective killing. I don't think everyone knew that the mid ground
was high grass and would just run straight through it. Thus making
themselves a very easy target. The rounds were not very long making
for quick games. The map does not really play well with large
teams, it became apparent that 14 people were too many. This just
made for easy kills.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">DM - Score</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">N/A. I'd consider this a teamplay
map only.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Originality - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Another feature unique to night
raid is the attempt at high grass on the map. A portion of the
middle section and the lower base, both have high grass. Just
crouch down and walk and only the upper portion of your body can
be seen by the enemy, making it more difficult to be spotted.
One minor fault is that the portion of the screen which simulates
below the grass is black. If possible this would be another fix
in a revised version.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">General Feel - Score 8</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The best overall feeling I've
had for a map yet. There are a few minor details which can be
resolved in future revisions, but this is a strong map. The map
could be a bit larger, possible with some trees or even access
to the tents. The map did feel a bit small with 14 people in a
team game. But this did make for some great action, as this mod
is supposed to do. Another excellent outdoor map. This map is
a must for all Action Quake 2 owners who enjoy team.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Final Rating - Score 7.7
(62/8)</FONT></B>
